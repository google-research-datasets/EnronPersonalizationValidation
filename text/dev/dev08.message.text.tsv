0	Here is what I started working on yesterday -- it isn't very far along.
1	When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.
1	It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.
1	In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes.
1	"Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board, consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. " Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?
2	These both track with the last drafts that I saw and commented on.
3	Thanks looks good.
3	I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details!
4	Jackie, Here is the Children's Church newsletter article: Children's Church Update A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.
4	Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.
4	Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.
4	The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.
4	This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.
4	Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!
4	Thanks Shelley P.S.
4	Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance.
5	Andy - I may join by phone, depending on logistics this afternoon.
5	I'll let you know.
6	Toby, Can you please provide me with a complete set of all the postings & extentions related to the outage to remove the MOPS 831 platform (starting around Aug 24 and continued several times).
7	Toby, Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.
7	Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.
7	For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.
7	Why can't each outage posting be its own document?
8	Here are my additional suggestions
9	Letter looks good.
9	Just a few thoughts: - In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done?
9	- Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?
9	Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter?
10	I'm flexible on the departure time
11	Ricki - Jean has been terrific in handling half a dozen emergencies this summer and the move logistics.
11	I would like to give her a gift from the gas logisitics team.
11	Should we send her flowers or do you have any other ideas?
12	Yes I will attend & I will bring a guest
13	Would you be my guest?
14	Can I get on the list to get a copy of the Socal billing issue complaint draft ?
15	Meet you downstairs at 5:50 -- that way we'll hit the HOV at "2" person time.
16	Oops my mistake.
16	I've lost track of my dates & was thinking that Winefest was several weeks off.
16	Its next week!
17	This is the message I'm getting when I try to access the FERC website.
17	Shelley Corman Enron Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
17	Please contact the server administrator, nancyh@gmu.edu and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

17	Apache/1.3.19 Server at www.gmu.edu Port 80
18	Thanks for her address
19	Catherine, Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.
19	This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.
19	She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.
19	She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.
19	We miss her terribly.
19	We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.
19	Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.
19	We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.
19	My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.
19	We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.
19	Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.
19	Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.
19	There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.
19	I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.
19	Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.
19	Larissa is a medical student.
19	She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.
19	Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.
19	Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.
19	Sorry for the long-winded background.
19	I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.
19	In His Name, Shelley Corman scorman@enron.com (work) cormanerb@cs.com (home)
20	A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint 1.
20	Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.
20	The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.
20	The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.
20	2.
20	I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.
20	Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.
20	The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).
20	3.
20	There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.
20	Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.
20	FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.
20	I think this is a 2000 case.
21	This order is even better.
21	It says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake.
22	Thanks for the update.
23	Suzanne, Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.
23	I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
23	I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.
23	One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.
23	The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.
23	I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.
23	At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.
23	I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.
23	Thanks for all your help.
23	After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?
23	Then she'll send to me to send to INS?
23	Probably sometime next week?
23	I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.
23	You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow.
24	Could you please send some insight into the Gas Pipeline Operational flow i|
25	Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs.
25	They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.
25	Help Joe -- what is this about?
25	Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?
25	This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.
25	Where/when can we make our case.
25	RE: G-33.
25	DOCKET# GX01-1 000 Discussion of Gas Pipeline Operational Flow Orders
26	Hi Cyndi, Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime.
26	I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.
26	How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound?
26	Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?
26	Gaby says she may take Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.
26	Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow.
27	Hi, Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.
27	Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.
27	I'm taking the day off tomorrow.
27	Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?
27	When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.
27	Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.
27	Two other items when you get a chance: -Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?
27	I can't recall the date.
27	-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.
27	I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.
27	Hope all is well.
27	Talk to you soon.
27	Shelley
28	Yes, I'm taking off tomorrow.
28	Wish you could too.
28	I'm planning on taking Chad to the Zoo.
29	FYI
30	I agree.
30	Elizabeth is making these changes.
31	yes - let it rip
32	Not that I can think of
33	I'm fine with the filing
34	Here are my edits to the FAQ document.
34	Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.
34	My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions - where storage allocation notices appear - why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.
34	Fixes already put in place In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.
34	Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items: - Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls - Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings - Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime - We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages - Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators - Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed" {See my suggestion in FAQ}
35	Sure -- Let me first make a run at the business needs and then prior to the general notice email, I'll take care of charitable requests.
35	Good idea.
36	Here is my recollection of the sequence of events.
36	The concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB standards.
36	FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.
36	GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.
36	While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.
36	I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.
36	Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the standardization.
37	Mike - I have Stan's staff meeting at 8.
38	Please store this info for me
39	Please save these files to a diskette for me, make a copy (so I can store one at home) & label the files Customer E-Mail Contact Info.
40	Gary -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee contact information during Tropical Storm Allison & during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.
40	When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.
40	I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.
40	Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-Enron ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the Enron intranet or servers are down?
41	Pam, Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.
41	I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.
41	On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.
41	Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.
41	This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.
41	During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.
41	This is best handled by having a central staging area.
41	I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.
41	Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.
41	But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.
41	I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.
41	Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group.
42	Sounds interesting (although I don't have capital dollars at this point for modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).
42	Let me touch base with my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you.
43	Ladies, The Holiday Shopping Card is a wonderful holiday tradition.
43	The card entitles the holder to a 20% discount from November 1-November 11 at a range of stores throughout town such as Berings, Macy's, Events, Harold Powell, Banana Republic, Tootsies, JoAnn's, Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Richards Liquors, Children's Collection, Talbots Kids, Zainy Brainy and many, many more.
43	The cards are available for $60.
43	The entire $60 goes to the American Cancer Society and is tax-deductible.
43	Checks and credit cards are accepted.
43	Please contact Kimberly Nelson at x33580 if you'd like to purchase a Holiday Card and start your holiday shopping early and benefit a great cause at the same time.
44	There was no attachment
45	Looks great
46	Suzanne, Hope you are doing well.
46	Any update on when Gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy?
46	I was hoping that I might be in a position to forward to the INS later this week.
46	I have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on INS approval.
46	Shelley Corman
47	Please mark on my calendar & print out this file.
48	Please forward this letter & invoice to GulfSouth.
48	I am sending an email copy to Claire.
49	Thanks for you voice message.
49	I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday.
49	In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.
49	He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.
49	I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.
49	Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter.
50	I think we expected it.
50	The ALJ said he need more time for his decision.
50	On a positive note, it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement
51	Yes Thank You - The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today.
51	I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today.
52	Liz, I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.
52	My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.
52	We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.
52	We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.
52	Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.
52	We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.
52	So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.
52	One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.
52	She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.
52	Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.
52	Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.
52	Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.
52	Sorry to ramble so.
52	I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc. Please feel free to call or email me anytime.
52	Here is my contact info.
52	Shelley Corman (husband Kim Erb) 14126 Scarborough Fair scorman@enron.com (work) cormanerb@cs.com (home) 713-853-7083 (work) 281-531-0385 (home) 713-857-2103 (cell)
53	If you haven't filed yet - the reference should be to gas logistics and not market services.
53	Thanks
54	John - As promised, albeit a week late - ETS Communication Budget for 2001 & 2002.
54	2002 Plan 2001 Plan 2001 Plan vs Actuals
55	I'd change the reference to Management Team to "Gas Logistics Team"
56	In the past we have blessed RAC as a truly corporate function with whom we could share information and receive services.
56	When I read that there are power trading folks on the RAC team, my radar goes up about the need to put firewalls in place within RAC.
57	Looking forward to our discussion.
58	I don't think that it is absolutely imperative to attend.
58	However, we may be able to help Joe define some of the customer benefits of electronic service.
58	Can one of the Tobys attend?
59	Please also put all this data with the weekly calendar
60	Fine with me
61	Please see the attached notice about a drawing for Astros Playoff tickets to be held today.
62	Hey all, Can I get a copy of the settlement bullets sent to FERC staff and indicated shippers.
62	Lynn, Darrell, Brad & I are working on ideas on how we could revised current posting and customer point/path/segment look-up capabilities and are interested in learning whether our revised capacity procedures are any more specific than in the earlier draft we looked at.
63	I was referring to the fact that Bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of NNG and is posted as such on the website.
63	Bearpaw has a transport contract on NNG.
64	I can't join you in walking this year, but you can put me down for a $50 contribution.
64	I don't need a shirt though -- I still have JDF shirts from years past.
65	Sorry but Lynn already gave it away
66	I talked to Ginger this morning.
66	She received my dossier and is sending it for translation.
66	She said she will be at Chris Ivins today reviewing dossiers.
66	She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in Austin.
66	I asked Ginger to send you the picture of Oksana.
66	She said that she thought she had already had.
66	She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later.
66	Talk to you soon.
67	Please print and store for next week's calendar items
68	Caroline - Would you be amenable to renaming your weekly report?
68	There is some confusion that this report is the Gas Logistics report.
68	Thanks for your help.
69	Jo, Kent & Dave, Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to: - Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info.
69	- Add additional interconnect points - Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area - Improve formatting and readability.
69	Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report.
69	Please confirm that it meets with your expectations.
69	We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week.
70	Please RSVP that I will attend.
71	Mike - I'll be out at the Ops.
71	conference until 9 AM.
71	Could you please coordinate the meeting time at the Enron building with Jude/Bill.
71	Ricki I'm assuming that you have set our travel to ballpark.
71	Also, I want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while.
71	Mike - Can we quickly pull together dinner/happy hour plans (casual) downtown after the game (perhaps Ricki could reserve a spot for 10 at the old Irma's over by the ballpark) where Dannis, Steve, Jack, Rachel, schedulers, etc. meet us.
71	I need to leave downtown by 7 PM for a meeting this evening and I want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements.
72	Danny, Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.
72	On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.
72	It turned out great.
72	Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.
72	I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.
72	Yesterday Brad took Jodie Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.
72	Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to the game.
72	It was a great morale builder.
72	Thanks.
72	We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).
72	Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with Mike Bryant and I. I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.
72	Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel will join us.
72	I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.
72	Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.
72	I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements.
73	Something like "Financial Support- IT & Gas Logistics"
74	Please add to my calendar
75	FYI Only Attached is a copy of the Gas Logistics presentation that I gave at Phil Lowry's operations conference this morning.
76	Stan, Attached is a summary of the current pipeline segment GISB Board terms and suggested motions for the upcoming INGAA Board Meeting.
76	Summary of Pipeline Segment GISB Board Terms Name Company Term Expires Another Term?
76	Stan Horton Enron Transportation Services Dec 31, 2001 No Richard Kruse Duke Energy Gas Dec 31, 2002 n/a Terry McGill Columbia Gulf Transmission Dec 31, 2001 Yes Ron Mucci Williams Gas Pipeline Dec 31, 2002 n/a John Somerhalder El Paso Energy Pipeline Group Dec 31, 2001 Yes Suggested Board Motion: * Motion to extend board terms of Messers Somerhalder and McGill for another two-year term and elect Shelley Corman of Enron for a two-year board term though Dec. 31, 2003.
76	Joe - Please make sure that Joan Dreskin adds GISB Board Representation as an item for the upcoming INGAA Board Meeting.
77	Glad you had fun -- but sorry the Astros didn't do their part!
78	I'll be at the meeting Friday.
78	Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.
78	Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M?
79	No revenue is better.
79	I've already been over our O&M with my directors.
80	Too much partying yesterday -- so I didn't finish my homework.
80	I'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the Commission meeting.
80	So I'll send them to you by 10:30 AM of so.
80	If you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know.
81	It has been terrific to correspond with Liz & satisfying to help her get info on Oksana from my correspondence with Larisa.
81	My dossier is with Ginger, hopefully being translated.
81	I have not yet received my INS approval and I'm scared that I'll anger them if I start calling.
82	Thanks.
82	I got your voice message.
82	I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.
82	Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style.
83	Kent, I can get together on Tues.
83	at 1:30.
83	I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.
83	But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.
83	I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.
83	For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.
83	I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.
83	Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.
83	The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).
83	We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.
83	I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.
83	Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it.
84	FYI
85	Thanks for the invite.
85	Unfortunately, we have a customer meeting at South Shore Harbor that day.
85	Hope you are doing well.
85	I haven't made it home to a football game yet this year -- although I guess that has been a blessing.
85	Shelley Corman
86	Please add to my personal contact list
87	Here is my two cents...
87	From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches overhang the condominium fence.
87	If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.
87	The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on our property or destroy the tree.
87	A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road.
87	A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.
87	Since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue.
87	Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.
87	If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.
87	Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.
87	Bottom Line: We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.
88	Do you know?
89	Hi Ms. Traylor, I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like recent mail jitters are coming into play.
89	Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?
89	I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.
89	Hope all is well with you.
89	I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.
89	At first he expected to be coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.
89	Boy how things have changed in a month.
89	Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.
89	I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.
89	It is just what Chad needs to develop.
89	While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.
89	Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.
89	She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.
89	The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.
89	He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears.
89	If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.
89	Regards, Shelley Corman (Chad's Mom)
90	The Orphans petitions coordinator at the Houston INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.
90	She said that we should receive the approval notification form within a week.

92	I'm fine with these latest changes to our OBA mark-up.
93	I'm traveling to Florida on a business meeting on Thursday.

97	You don't need to keep the attachment.
97	I was going to read it online -- but since you've printed I'll take it along for casual reading.
97	I just want to add Liz Gras email address to my contacts.
97	Sorry for the confusion.
98	I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.
98	This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.
98	I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.
98	Evidentally there was some issue......
99	Please add Suzanne Hoffman to my contact list -- Her email address is twhiteman@austin.rr.com

102	Sherry called Kim the other night to see if he would run for the HOA.
102	Surely there must be more to this.
102	Why wouldn't the HOA pay their bills?
102	I'll have to ask Joe Carrabba tonight.
103	Drew - In your new organization is Frazier the marketing affiliate attorney?
103	or Hartsoe?
103	We need to continue to refine the procedure for posting updates.
103	For example this week I found some overdue changes that needed to be made to the website.
104	I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.
104	If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices.
105	Here is my mark-up.
105	Please make sure that it is factually correct.
106	Thanks
107	I agree since I am at the bank right now
108	Now I'm back at my desk.
108	I think we've finally found the right tool for you to stay constantly in touch with me.
109	Great
110	Great!
110	I will review them on Monday no need to send to FL.
111	Are you going to apply?
112	I am out of town on business.
112	Are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express?
112	On Sat Chad has a 3 pm soccer game and at 5.30 birthday party.
112	We can work around these plans if you prefer.
113	I am out of town on business tonight.
113	I saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply.
113	Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.
113	I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.
113	I didn't hear from Ginger this week.
113	I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.
113	Suzanne emailed me that Randi Thompson the head of Kidsave is in Kazakstan right now and will be sending out an email to the Kidsave families.
113	Regards.
113	Shelley
114	Whqt interview?
115	Great.
115	I am getting back early around 4.30.
115	We will meet you at 6.30 even if John is late we can have wine and catch up.
116	I am getting home early.
116	We are supposed to land at 3 pm.
116	Love you .
117	Please set something up
118	Thanks for taking the lead on this
119	We received our INS approval today and will overnight thr notarized version to Ginger Monday.
119	So it is all in Ginger's hands now.
119	Shelley
120	Rick, When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).
120	I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.
120	I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.
120	What is your team working on on Gulfstream?
120	Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.
120	I think I had the outdated one prior to the latest printing.
120	Thanks Shelley
121	I now have another meeting over the lunch hour.
121	Perhaps another day this week?
122	I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.
122	Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.
122	Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.
122	Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.
122	I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.
123	We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.
123	The kids were pretty wild.
123	It wasn't one of our better days.
123	Oh well!
123	If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.
123	I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.
123	I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.
123	Would that be okay?
123	Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.
123	He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help) and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).
124	Liz, I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.
124	She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.
124	She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.
124	They are not traveling until Nov. 15.
124	We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.
124	This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.
124	I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.
124	I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.
124	What do you think?
124	Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.
124	Shelley
125	I am avialable tomorrow afternoon.
125	Will 2 PM ET work for you?
125	Will you call me or should I call you?
126	Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.
126	That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.
126	Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.
126	I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15.
126	On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.
126	Wow this waiting is stressful.
126	Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.
126	Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.
126	We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.
126	But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim.
127	Maintenance of Houston, Inc. 6220 West Park, Suite 106 Dear Mr. _____________, By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.
127	Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.
127	In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.
127	We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.
127	We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.
127	It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.
127	It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.
127	Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.
127	To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.
127	Sincerely Shelley Corman, on behalf of Ashford United Methodist Trustees cc: Cindy Lewis, Church Office
128	I signed up for the class today.
128	I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat.
128	Nov 3.
128	Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.
128	The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.
128	I'll give you better directions later.
128	Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.
128	I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing.
129	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Regulation of Short-Term Natural ?
129	Docket No. RM98-10-000 Gas Transportation Services ?
129	Regulation of Interstate Natural ?
129	Docket No. RM98-12-000 Gas Transportation Services ?
129	MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES Pursuant to the March 21, 2001 Notice of Petition in the above-referenced proceedings and Rules 212, 212 and 214 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("Commission") regulations (18 C.F.R. ? 385.211, 385.212 and 385.214 ), the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March 16, 2001 Petition of the American Gas Association ("AGA Petition").
129	I. All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to: Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O.
129	Box 1188 Phone: 713-853-7083 Email: shelley.corman@enron.com Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC 20006 Phone: 202-466-9148 Email: nancy.bagot@enron.com MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines.
129	2.
129	Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.
129	In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.
129	These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines.
129	The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.
129	Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.
129	COMMENTS The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.
129	Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.
129	First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.
129	Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.
129	Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.
129	For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.
130	No, we live about 2-3 mi.
130	off I-10.
130	It is really easy to get to our house from Austin by taking 71 to I-10 east.
130	Here is a turn by turn: Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown Houston).
130	Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).
130	Take right onto Briarforest Drive.
130	Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).
130	We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.
130	Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.
130	14126 Scarborough Fair Also last night I emailed Sergei a brief note regarding what Ginger was telling us yesterday.
130	I didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date -- but I wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in.
131	Dates all work great.
131	As you mentioned, I will likely be traveling in late November or early December
132	I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.
132	We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.
132	They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.
132	Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.
132	Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.
132	I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).
132	We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.
132	When I get a little better info.
132	I will make Children's Church plans.
132	If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.
132	It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.
132	If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.
132	I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.
133	Fantastic.
133	Is Sheila planning to attend?
133	If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed.
133	If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list.
133	I will take 2 seats.
133	Please give me the invites for those two.
133	I'll take care of their transport.
133	They will not need Enron transport.
134	Interesting
135	Thanks for the info.
135	I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.
135	FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.
135	I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.
135	A couple of further things that I need: - I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.
135	There are huge differences.
135	Can these really all be receipt imbalances?
135	Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.
135	We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.
135	Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.
135	I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.
136	Return to Ricki and she can take care of it
137	Great.
137	Last week I was invited to a forum, but I was disappointed that I could not attend.
138	I consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis.
139	Thanks.
139	No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.
139	The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.
140	You could never be a bother.
140	A woman serving food at a volunteer event always has a special place in my heart.
140	I bought the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken & the caesar salad bowls (in plastic bowls - near fruit bowls) from Albertson.
140	Just added some extra parmesan.
141	My preference is to send out the notice as a Staff Meeting w/ Halloween Snacks.
141	I'd rather it be just us for this meeting.
142	Hi Mom, Chad just loves his apple checkboard.
142	Thanks again for it.
142	I am still feeling sick.
142	Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.
142	I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.
142	I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.
142	Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.
142	It seems kind of rude and presumptious.
142	However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide this list: Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20) -Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows) (more expensive item) -Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows) -Harry Potter Trading Cards -Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs" -Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item) -Ultra Grip Nerf Football Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.
142	More Later Shelley
143	Joan, Stan tells me that in 2002 I will have the privilege of representing the pipeline segment on the GISB Board.
143	Will you be letting Rae McQuade know the results of the pipeline segment board elections?
144	Hi.
144	Hope your week is going well.
144	I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like).
144	Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.
144	Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.
144	I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.
144	What would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments Sat?
144	My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game.
144	If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?
145	Could you make a Dr appt for tomorrow for the Dr on level 3.
146	Tomorrow is fine
147	Did Ginger give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to Kazakhstan?
147	Shelley
148	GISB group has not met yet.
149	I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing Chad's Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.
149	My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.
149	Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.
150	Tonya, Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.
150	All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.
150	Ginger and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.
150	Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.
150	Shelley
151	When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.
151	If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.
151	I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.
151	While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in. After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.
151	Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.
152	I'll be on the call for the first 1/2 hour.
152	Theresa will be on for the whole call.
152	We can re-group to talk about comments after the call.
153	I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.
153	My editorial notes are added in red.
153	Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.
153	AWESOME VISIT On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school.
153	The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan.
153	Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00!
153	The children were very impressed!
153	The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar!
153	The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school.
153	Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
153	As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them.
153	The program opened with the singing of the school song.
153	Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States) led the group in the Pledge.
153	The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags.
153	Not an eye was dry!
153	It was awesome.
153	Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children.
153	Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution!
153	The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.

155	Please clarify - Is the first name in the list the gift buyer or gift receipient?
156	Just got home from work ...
156	but that is funny, cause I'm still working -- now at home.
156	Guess you've probably heard about events at my company.
156	If you couldn't see the red -- the editorial notes were also in parentheticals You dickens -- you were only supposed to get Chad 1 item from the list.
156	Then I pass it on to Tracey, Pat, Arliene etc.

159	Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.
159	The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.
159	This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.
159	This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.
160	Here is a sample of articles
161	Please add to my calendar
162	First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01.
162	Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.
162	Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.
162	This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.
162	The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.
162	I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M. The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).
163	FYI - I made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together TW/NNG revenue summaries for review by the bankers that Rod/Kevin are working with.
163	Thought you might me interested in the report.
163	It gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties.
164	Here is the presentation for the 2:30 meeting today
165	Revised presentation for the meeting this afternoon
166	Hi Ginger & Chris, Hope you are doing well.
166	Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.
166	When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.
166	After I get off the phone I always think of questions I should have asked.
166	Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.
166	I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.
166	How long does translation take?
166	What happens after that?
166	When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?
166	Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?
166	I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.
166	Sorry for so many questions.
166	I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.
166	I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.
166	Shelley Corman
167	I will be thinking of you
168	I have rates and capacity utilization info ready.
168	I'll call you whan I get to the office.
169	Is the system running ok this morning?
170	I heard.
170	I'm just pulling intop garage and will call back in a minute
171	With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items: 1.
171	When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.
171	I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.
171	It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.
171	2.
171	When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.
171	I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.
171	The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.
171	Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.
171	But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....
172	I would propose to use only the Mainline West sheet.

174	I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.
174	We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.
174	Shelley is a kind and loving person.
174	She is active in her church and in charitable activities.
174	I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and Kim as a couple since that time.
174	Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents to their six-year old son Chad.
174	It has been a delight to watch them raise Chad to be such a fine young man.
174	I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.
174	Sincerely Christi Nicolay {contact info} Please call Ava Garcia to pick it up when done.
174	Thanks -- I'll call you tonight
175	Thanks for the info
176	Elizabeth Brown will forward the capacity release data shortly
177	Kevin The dial in network is down so Elizabeth is headed into the office to get the PGE capacity release report.
177	It may be an hour.
177	Sorry for the delay.
178	Thanks I needed that today!
179	Fuel is retained in kind from the shippers.
180	If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity.
180	We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.
180	FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.
180	!
181	Rick I have a number of contracts that the bankers want early tomorrow.
181	I am assuming Elizabeth will be in to help me?
182	We received a call this morning from a gentleman, Todd Bearden (954-981-1101), who recently moved into a home in Hollywood FL and is trying to obtain information about gas service, could one of you pass this request on the appropriate person at NUI-City Gas or TECO/PGS?
183	I will be about 15 minutes late
184	You are welcome.
184	What a neat idea - electronic thank you cards.
185	FYI While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max.
185	rates.
185	For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.
185	(approx $18 mil revenues to Cal. + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million
186	Thanks I will look at it tonight
187	That must be frustrating.
187	I've asked HR to address this problem.
188	I know that the long term solution rests with Charlie Thompson.
188	But, Caroline, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.
188	I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.
188	When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.
188	I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.
188	No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.
188	Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.
188	I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.
189	Perhaps this can help with the non-Red Rock piece.
189	This spreadsheet takes current rates and multiples out against MDQ for 2002.
189	It also show billing units through 2005.
189	I have reconciled this schedule with Jan Moore and Lindy Donoho
190	Here is data format.
190	This is for time period 10/1/00-9/30/01.
190	Now I'm looking for calendar years 1997, 1998, 199 & 2000
191	Peggy, Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you.
191	I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.
191	I am so happy for you.
191	I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people.
191	Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch.
191	I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions.
191	I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl.
191	Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.
191	Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 (work) 713-857-2103 (cell)
192	Thank you.
192	These are great!
193	When I asked you to adjust the Gas Logistic's PAA's to $100, I forgot to ask you to do the same on the separate PAA for gift checks for EOTT pipeline control.
193	Please give me a call if you need any supplemental paperwork from me.
193	Happy Holidays
194	Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.
194	To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.
194	For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.
195	I'm planning on heading out the office around 3 PM or so.
195	Feel free to send home staff as business needs permit.
195	I'm not planning on sending out any kind of notice to all Gas Logistics -- as I feel like it is frustrating to those that must stay.
195	Have a safe and happy holiday.
195	I'll be in Austin tomorrow & Friday, so call me on my cell (713-857-2103) or email me if you need me.
195	In case of emergency, I can be reached at my brother-in-law's house in Austin at 512-474-5631.
196	I'll have someone pull the volumes in the morning if its not too late.
196	Sorry but my messages didn't come across my blackberry when I was in Austin Fri & Sat.
197	Liz could you please confirm your address (especially the zip) for the fedex package.
197	16816 Mouse Trap Dr Round Rock, TX 78686
198	Good morning all.
198	Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday.
198	Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.
198	Help?
198	Can someone pull this together quickly for me?
199	Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.
199	My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.
199	But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.
199	I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.
199	Can you recommend an ENT?
199	Looking forward to seeing you soon.
200	Thanks.
200	If you could have Richard add the volumes in as columns into this schedule format that would be great.
200	Rod needs this ASAP.
200	Are you available to come by for a few minutes before staff meeting?
200	I need to talk to you about a new round of due diligence and a conference call this afternoon.
201	I had Kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so I can fedex tonight.
201	I am so bummed about Jan. travel date and not having Alina for Christmas.
201	Is this for sure?
201	Was she speaking just about me or was she saying Jan 1 for you too?
201	Why Jan 1?
201	If there holidays are Dec 30-Jan 1, then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then, so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays?
201	Sorry for all the venting!
202	It is late in the day
203	Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.
203	Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?
203	Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?
203	I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.
203	Here is the missing language STATE OF TEXAS COUNTY OF HARRIS Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.
203	My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.
203	While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.
203	She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.
203	On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.
203	When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.
203	You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.
204	Rick - Stan has announced that there is a hiring freeze in effect.
204	We will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to Stan.
204	Couple this with the fact that I need to present to Danny/Stan a proposal on how we can trim our 2002 O&M and I'm not inclined to make such a pick.
204	Lets talk about how we can redeploy our current resources to cover....I especially want to talk about how we pick use the accounting coordinators in an expanded role.
205	Alma - can you copy me on the RSVP list for the Thursday party.
206	this is working from shelley's office, i will send you a note from my desk....
206	thanks for everything!!!!!!!
207	I'll take care of the programs
208	Okay - now I've lost the file.
208	I guess I deleted the wrong message.
208	Can you resend?
209	Sarah, Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.
209	At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.
209	For example, for calendar year 1997: Short-term = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98 + all IT & PNR revenues Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.
209	Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.
209	Call me at x37083 if you have questions.
210	I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.
210	What will lose?
210	What have we not paid back?
211	Will call you at 9 tonight.
212	Kevin, Please call ASAP.
212	While I have been working through the theory on how to make this happen, but I don't know the details on which pipelines and which accounts.
213	I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.
213	Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.
214	Please call.
214	I'm confused about the hotel amount.
214	Alma - we will hand out the prizes in a raffle on the date of our holiday luncheon on Dec. 11.
215	Please come by to sign the certificates.
216	Please provide written notice of postponement and tell them to bill us.
217	We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.
217	If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.
217	Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.
217	I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.
217	We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.
217	You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.
217	In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply.
218	Yes, please assure Galen of his need to recuperate.
218	Will you send him a fruit basket from the group.
218	How are you coming at getting Debbie Thompson or Blair or Larry Berger lined up?
219	We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts.
219	Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities.
220	No thank you for all you and your teammates do.
220	I get a bit frustrated when Stan says that "we all need to re-focused back to work. I need to remind him that we have never lost our focus, that despite what has been going on, our staff has continued to work 24/7 to maintain our service level to our customers.
221	I would like these individuals to have a training with Teb Lokey today or tomorrow.
221	Teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time.
222	FYI
223	Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.
223	I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.
223	I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.
223	As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled.
224	Bob, FYI.
224	The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.
224	I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.
225	I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.
225	I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.
225	Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.
225	Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.
225	Thanks
226	Rick - please add contract listings & proof/have letters put on letterhead for my signature.
226	Thanks
227	A couple of thoughts - Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.
227	We'd only have to take Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.
227	- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).
227	I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.
227	- I want to me flexible on travel.
227	But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.
228	I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.
228	Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?
228	- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence - When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters - And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.
228	I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.
229	Almost 100% certain that its just me.
229	I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs).
230	FYI
231	I know you were being nice and I am sorry.
231	I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.
231	It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.
231	I shouldn't have been so mean to you.
231	I know you were being nice.
231	I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.
231	The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.
231	My physical was ok.
231	Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.
231	So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics.
231	Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?
232	Gina, Did you ever prepare a set of talking points on the separateness of the pipelines from Enron.
233	Liz - I noticed that Luftansa has flights back on Dec 27 from Moscow.
233	Using the same itinerary that we discussed before -- but for Dec 11 returning Dec 27 listed fare is $2830.40.
234	Your prayers and concerns are much appreciated!
235	Thanks Gary.
235	This is an excellent plan.
236	Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.
236	My understanding of this is as follows: In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).
236	In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.
237	Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.
237	1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities - They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
237	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.
237	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning.
237	Access to Gas Control will be through the South hallway and door only.
237	Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well.
237	The guard will be checking everyones card prior to entry.
237	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and IT support staff.
237	We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the South door.
237	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation Center (EB42C1).
237	2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should.
237	We are taking steps to be prepared to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS.
237	On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics business functions.
237	Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, and workstations.
237	They will be configured to support up to 60 staff.
237	The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff.
237	The Hangar will be left configured for approximately two weeks, depending on events.
238	Rod, Do you know how to get in touch with Paul Cherry or Dan Fancler over the weekend?
238	I have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.
238	I need to have someone run a payables list.
238	I can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103
239	I'm in my office now
240	FYI - Thought you might be interested in Gary Smith's response to these questions
241	Rick Dietz and I are both in the office.
241	Please give Rick a call to coordinate putting our OBA payable info together with your payable information
242	Gary, Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.
243	FYI
244	I don't this we give our customers lockbox instructions any longer.
244	Invoices cite wire instructions and physical address.
244	Raetta please confirm.
245	Can you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.
245	It looks like it left my account.
245	Also can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?
245	It doesn't look like its in the account either.
246	Thank you for your thoughts.
246	I am fine.
246	Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.
246	While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.
246	It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!
247	Yes can do.
248	Please remove my name from you solicitation list
249	Shelley Ann Corman
250	I know you are swamped with other matters, so I jotted down in memo form my travel plans.
250	I guess it's Murphy's Law that I got the phone call that I need to travel now in the midst of current work events.
251	John, Per Stan Horton's voicemail, attached is letter from you as the pipeline segment board chair to the GISB office indicating the pipeline segment's desire to fill Stan's seat for the December 5 Board Meeting.
252	Hi Becky, I'm thinking of you.
252	Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.
252	I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.
252	She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.
252	Shelley
253	Rae, Just a heads up -- pending pipeline board rep approval, Stan asked that I prepare the attached letter for John Somerhalder to send to the GISB office if this is appropriate form.
254	Looks like FPL is getting back-up gas supplies to keep their nominations up.
254	See attached for updated gas day 12/4/01 through ID1.
255	Sorry but I don't know the status.
256	Thanks.
256	Don't know how that happened.
256	I'll call you when I get downstairs tomorrow am.
257	Thanks.
257	I went to see Dr. Shelley Leeds Rickets this am.She is a Baylor grad and is very nice.
257	Glad you weren't in an accident today.
257	Have a good trip.
258	What a crazy day.
258	I'm in the waiting room of the ENT now.
258	I will make meatloaf for dinner when I get home.
259	See you at noon.
260	Stan is having a 1/2 day staff meeting next Wed.
260	Dec 12 until lunchtime.
260	Accordingly, I need to reschedule my staff meeting.
260	Please let me know about your availability to meet from 1-3 PM on Dec. 12 in my office.
261	Jackie, I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13.
261	I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.
261	I think I've misplaced her email address.
261	If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.
261	Thanks and have a blessed holiday.
261	Shelley
262	Publish away!
263	Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions.
263	You show $3 Million in savings.
263	I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap.
263	budget.
263	In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included.
264	The Phase VI upgrade wasn't on the list of projects that Gary submitted, but not to worry as you will see on the attached it is and always has been part of my overall Gas Logistics capital budget.
265	Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.
265	So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.
265	The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).
265	The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).
265	Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.
265	Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.
265	We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.
265	At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.
265	We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.
265	All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.
265	You need not be present to win.
265	Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.
265	My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.
265	The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.
265	Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.
265	While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.
265	At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.
265	I'm looking forward to our get together next week.
265	To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.
266	It's been a few days now since ENA dropped their gas supply from ENA from 250M down to approx 75-85M and FPL has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ENA gas and still keeping its nominations at 800M.
266	Here is a quick snapshot of where FPL is sourcing there gas from: Exxon 35 Western Gas 30 El Paso 96 Aquila 20 Duke 26 Coral 20 National Energy 15 Delivered Gas: Reliant 31 Energy Authority 7 Total FPL Supply 828 Less: FPL Energy Services 21 Total FPL Deliveries 807 (774 Firm + 33)
267	Thanks for your kind words.
268	Hi Cindy, I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.
268	For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb. (unsual bonus time).
268	Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.
268	I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.
268	????
268	Shelley
269	Diane, Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system.
269	And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly.
269	Please call me if you have any questions.
269	Shelley Corman
270	Catherine, I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.
270	My husband and son are staying back.
270	I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.
270	I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.
270	I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.
270	Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.
270	Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to Houston around Dec 30.
270	This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.
270	I will certainly miss being away from home at Christmas and am hoping to find a Christmas worship service in Almaty.
270	I'd appreciate any advice in this regard.
270	I would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring.
270	Thanks Shelley Corman and
271	Sorry for the delay.
271	My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!
271	Remember that conversation we had about 2001.
271	I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.
271	Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.
271	Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.
271	So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.
271	Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.
271	So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.
271	I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.
271	But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow.
271	Surely they have some sort of ISP access.
271	My current ISP is Compuserve.
271	Mail address: cormanerb@cs.com ; User: cormanerb; password: chad4erb.
271	I currently have version 5.0 loaded -- there is a 6.0 available but I haven't had a chance to download.
271	My Enron password is also chad4erb.
271	I'm at the house (281-531-0385) if you need any other info.
272	Thanks for your information and words of reassurance.
272	Here is my email address: work home
273	Thanks for your note!
273	I guess you're living proof that one can successfully make it through the twists and turns of international adoption.
274	address is customer@e-worldphone.com My order number id 12/9/0175186.45 password: chad2214
275	Ava, Could you please generate an envelope to Across the World Adoptions.
275	Thanks
276	Sounds fine
277	If you don't know about the NNG quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet.
277	I'm hoping to have a conversation with Mary Kay tomorrow before its posted.
277	Thanks.
277	Get back to your kid stuff now!
278	FYI
279	Great!
280	Please verify that this is taken care of and that I do not need to have someone in my group work on this.
280	Thanks.
281	I'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $181.17 deduct from my 12/31 paycheck.
282	Fran, I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.
282	I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).
282	I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.
282	I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues: - Stop PAC contributions - Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases - Stop 2002 United Way deduct.
282	I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).
282	My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.
282	Thanks in advance for your help.
283	My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.
283	I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.
284	Thanks.
284	You are the best!
285	Either Galen or Jim Studebaker.
285	I'll check with Sheila.
286	Do you have a few minutes to meet this morning?
287	I don't understand why the schedule show no variance for Gas Logistics.
287	My workpapers indicate that we should be down by $300K or so
288	Thanks for the information.
288	Do you happen to have an email address for Elza?
289	Ditto back at you.
289	Sounds like things have been crazy at Halliburton this week.
290	Please add to my contact list
291	Please add Lou Moore to my contact list
292	Please add John Baily to my contact list
293	Please add
294	Need to talk to you about this
295	Thanks.
295	Yes, I forgot to mention how sad I was to learn about Cuba.
296	I agree that this is the revised capital budget that we should submit.
297	Chris, I never heard back from you after I sent the fax yesterday.
297	I am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the INS forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute.
297	Shelley Corman
298	I haven't received my dossier.
299	Both Kim's parents & my mom will be at the house on Christmas eve/Christmas day -- so I think they'll eat their Christmas meal at our house.
299	I'm sure that Kim, Chad, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.
299	You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat.
299	night.
299	Have fun at the violin concert.
300	Hi Sherene, Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.
300	He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball.
300	I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.
300	Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.
300	Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.
300	A box is on its way to you.
300	Have a blessed holiday.
300	Love Shelley
301	Thank you for your kind note.
301	Frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year, I don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will handle anything that comes our way.
302	Please print (incl attachment) and keep for reference
303	Oh my perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of Chad's rock collection.
303	It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.
303	He would love anything about rocks.
304	Is this cash coming into TW?
305	I would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with adescription from the reps about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.
305	Especially Peoples.
305	On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples.
306	Please send it to both of us.
306	Given Gary's presentation on bonus timing I plan to turn in my recomendations today.
306	Can I meet with you at 4:oo?
306	I am meetin with my direct reports at 1 to work on recommendations.
306	So I need your spreadsheets ASAP
307	Thanks see you at 4
308	Any chance of doing the one penny test with the credit departments of the top couple of customers.
309	Please add to contacts
310	The offers to help you keep rolling in.
311	Jennie - This looks okay if I wait for my husband or Liz to go on the 20th -- although I think the return would need to be extended a day or so.
311	Could you also see about if I am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave Sat.
311	I was searching the Internet and it looks like the Lufthansa flight is still available on Sat.
311	I need to make some quick decisions about what I'm doing tomorrow.
312	Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow).
312	This is all a shock.
312	I will have to travel by myself.
312	I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited.
312	I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs.
312	I am very excited to see you though.
312	Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow.
312	Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday.
312	I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days.
312	But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston.
312	So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work.
312	I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer.
312	I will bring pictures of your visit this summer.
312	I will also bring warm clothes!
312	I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz.
312	I am so happy to hear that she has a family.
313	Jean -- I keep getting these messages.
313	I just got another batch of 6 similar reminders
314	Sorry I missed your call last night.
314	I had a good cry and went to bed early.
314	As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.
314	It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).
314	Here is the other part of my plans.
314	I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.
314	I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.
314	Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.
314	I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.
314	That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary.
314	Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.
314	I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there.
314	Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.
314	I am totally terrified about traveling by myself -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.
314	I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.
314	I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.
314	Will the assistance service help me at customs?
314	Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?
314	Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?
314	Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.
314	I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.
314	Shelley Corman
315	Donna - lets meet tomorrow AM to translate the bonus/merit info into spreadsheet form
316	FYI - This is what the supply breakdown looks like for FPL without ENA in the equation
317	Don't worry -- whenever you get here is fine with me
318	Attached is a copy of Theresa's mid-yr review
319	Jennie, When you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.
319	If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.
319	I don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).
319	I would like to make such a reservation is possible.
319	I think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.
319	Please call me when you get a chance.
319	Shelley Corman
320	I keep getting these notes.
320	Help!
321	Kim, My nonstop direct from Houston cleared for tomorrow (4:40 PM).
321	The only catch is that I have to go to the airport this afternoon to change my tickets.
321	My return back from Moscow on the 30th also cleared.
321	I am still waitlisted for a return flight from Almaty on the 23rd.
322	Just got off the phone with Jennie and I know you already talked to her.
322	My direct flight tomorrow cleared so I plan on taking it.
322	I will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th & then we can spend some of our waiting time together.
323	yes
324	travel
325	This sounds fine.
325	Please have my phone forwarded to Ava and provide her with my contact information.
326	Looks good
327	Thanks for your leadership on this issue.
327	The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.
327	I'm glad you are involved!
327	I will be traveling out of the country next week.
327	Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.
327	Happy Holidays Shelley
328	Made it to Almaty.
328	Thanks for all your help.
328	It is hard to access my enron mail from my hotel.
328	If you need to get in touch with me, please email me at cormanerb@cs.com Shelley
329	Ricki -- I think it's working.
330	Jennie, I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements.
330	I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning.
330	I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed.
330	Jan 9.
330	My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ?
330	Please advise Shelley Corman
331	Terrific.
331	I called to let Kim know.
331	They will be leaving in just a few hours.
331	One last item.
331	Can you make them a reservation on this flight.
331	Kim will purchase the tickets at the Dallas Airport.
331	Flight: Continental Airlines flight 1662 on a McDonnell Douglas MD80 Jet - non-stop Arrive: Houston, TX Bush (IAH) - Wed, Jan 09 at 5:45pm
332	I sent it to her
333	Hi.
333	I'm here -- just barely though -- my sinus infection is back.
333	Can we get together in my office (the less elevator riding the better) sometime between 11-1?
333	I'm planning to be out of office tomorrow.
334	See you then 4262
335	Thanks for your message.
335	I returned home on Monday, but Kim and Alina are in the air right now and will arrive home tonight.
335	Please let me know about your availability for an appoint Thurs.
335	Jan 10 (PM) Fri Jan 11 Mon Jan 14 (PM) Tues, Jan 15 or Wed, Jan 16.
335	Thanks Shelley Corman
336	Here is my draft written review.
336	Take a look at it and we'll sit down when you have a chance.
336	Keep up the great work.
336	I know things have been really stressful for you lately.
336	It was terrific to have you to rely on when I was away (and when I'm here too!)
337	Here is my written review.
337	Let me know when you want to sit down and talk.
338	Donna, Here is the draft written performance review that I prepared while I was traveling.
338	I would be happy to sit down and discuss with you in person at your convenience.
339	Does Fri at 10 work for you?
339	I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.
339	Next week sounds fine for vacation.
339	I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan.
339	But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.
339	The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.
339	Playdate sounds great Talk to you tomorrow.
340	Yes please explain that 8 need Dr signature so she can start preschool Tues.
340	Besides Fri and Mon afternoons I don't have any other planned time off
341	I'll be in this afternoon and will give you a call
342	Great
343	Donna, Attached is the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.
343	I can't remember if I already sent this to you or not ...please forgive me if I already sent this to you (sinus congestion is not conducive to sound thinking).
343	Let me know when you want to sit down and talk.
344	Brad, Attached are the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.
344	Let me know when you would like to sit down and talk both about 2001 and directions for 2002.
345	I'm fine with giving him these charts and also the job description write ups from the website.
346	Barbara, Received your message.
346	I can't promise that I will attend, as things are pretty much ad hoc at my household at this time while I try to establish some new routines.
346	I'll try.
346	See you Sunday.
347	I'm okay with the information (with cost center numbers excised).
347	Thanks
348	Here are my thoughts
349	Thanks!
349	Saturday was great.
349	Yesterday was not a banner day for me.
349	I just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that I was feeling remorse.
349	You're probably the only person that can understand how I'm feeling.
349	Talk to you tonight.
349	If you and Chad are gone to Karate before we get home -- we'll go to the store and have dinner ready.
350	Hi Nancy I have Alina at the Dr for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.
350	Sorry I missed choir last night .
350	We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.
350	See you soon Shelley
351	Ha Ha - We have no busy schedule.
351	We are just trying to do exciting things like making it to work each day.
351	Feb. 9 is fine.
351	Of course you have so kindly showered Alina with gifts that she isn't in need of much.
352	Please touch base with Gina and let her handle this.
353	I guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that Lynn, Steve & Mike will be absent.
354	Sorry Teb but I have an appointment with the Sinus Dr. Can we visit in advance of your meeting?
355	Yes - please reschedule for Tues.
355	Thanks
356	How about 2:30?
356	I'll come to you if that time is okay.
357	Hi.
357	Thanks for the info.
358	Hi.
358	Sorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still "transitioning."
358	We will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.
358	We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.
358	I'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.
358	The videotape of the Christmas program is cute.
358	Maybe we can find a time to watch it.
359	My meeting with Rod is next Wed.
360	I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.
360	Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.
360	Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.
360	It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.
360	If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.
361	Did ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?
361	Any computers or just flat screens?
362	Sorry I'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion.
362	Nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy.
362	Before I left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers -- per Donna's note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet.
362	I'll let you know if I hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers.
362	Shelley
363	Ok I'm thru with appointment and am on my way in
364	Thanks again for the kind gift of beanie babies for the orphanage children.
364	Your kindness is memorialized in my journal.
364	If you are interested, I have in my office pictures of the kids with their beanies.
365	Please send me an email with your travel dates -- as I need to make some appointments and plans and I don't want to book while you are going to be gone.
365	Thanks
366	Tuesday will be fine
367	I would like to offer the gas controllers the first opportunity on the Gas Logistics Aeros tickets ( 4 tickets) for the month of February.
367	Available games are: Sun, Feb. 3 at 5 PM vs Utah Grizzlies Tue, Feb 5 at 7 PM vs Chicago Wolves Fri, Feb 15 at 7:30 PM vs Utah Grizzlies Wed, Feb 27 at 7 PM vs Chicago Wolves Please contact Ricki Winters at x35754 if you are interested.
367	The tickets will be given on a first come, first served basis.
368	Yes I am here actually I'm on a conference call.
368	I'll email later tonight.
368	Kim will be out of the country on Feb 9.
368	I'm hoping I can bring Alina and make a play date for Chad We are headed to Austin tomorrow.
368	We'll be back Sun.
368	Can you meet at T and C on Sun afternoon Chad would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree
369	I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.
369	I'll give it to you tomorrow.
369	Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.
369	Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.
369	How long can you guys shop?
369	I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.
369	What is the shower at Patsy's for?
369	When do you have to be there?
369	Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business Feb 8 to Feb 19.
370	I already had Donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.
370	It is rough still -- but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.
371	Christi - here is the plaintiff malpractice reference from Cyndi.
371	Rick used to work with Cindy at Full bright and recently formed his own firm.
371	I know him and he's a great guy.
371	Rick A. Eckerson Houston, Texas 77002 713-654-9353 (direct) 713-752-2199 (fax)
372	Sorry I missed your call last week.
372	Kim misplaced your email address so I'm taking a stab that this is it.
372	I'd love to talk to you about your upcoming adventure to Kazakhstan.
372	Do you know where in Kazakhstan you'll be adopting from?
372	Happy New Year Shelley
373	Please remind me of who you plan to have stay in the TW/FGT world to cover SCADA?
374	Please pick one up at lunch.
375	Thanks.
375	Please send a note to the gas controllers that we will be having a staff meeting
376	Hi Mrs. Traylor, Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get Alina ("Chad's new adopted sister) settled into our routines. We have been trying to keep Chad's routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time. While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests. This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student. Do you have any suggestions to help Chad with timed practice tests? Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks? If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about Chad's progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference. Thanks Shelley Corman-Erb
377	Patty, Stephanie & Barbara, I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.
377	Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").
377	The bible lessons are about David and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.
377	The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume Ann Turney made.
377	I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).
377	I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.
377	I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.
377	I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.
377	I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.
377	Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.
377	Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.
377	I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.
377	(Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri.
377	Feb 1 or Fri.
377	Feb 8 - if either of those days suit.
378	Thanks for your kind words.
378	I also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk.
379	In my office instead of 42c2.
379	Thanks
380	Yes.
380	Please add Tami Head, Barbara Bakanic & Maggie Van Syckle if its not too many.
380	The offer is still open for you and Linda to host at my house if you would like.
380	Here is Gaby's address: Gaby Paniagua
381	Okay
382	Hi There.
382	So glad you are back.
382	How was skiing?
382	Hope we can get together on Sat.
382	or Sun.
382	I never know the polite way to suggest gifts.
382	Perhaps just a gift ideas list?
382	Summer clothes (Size 4T pants/5T shirts) Swimming accessories Loving Family Dollhouse Furniture & Accessories Gift certificates * In lieu of gifts, contributions can be made in Alina's honor to Kidsave International
383	Sorry I missed you today.
383	Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.
383	Will 11:45 at La Grilia suit you?
383	Have fun at your event tonight.
383	Also - mea culpa.
383	I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed Matt's birthday.
383	I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house.
383	Oops.
383	Wish Matt a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion.
383	See you tomorrow.
384	See you at 4 Pm
385	Now that we have Alina's initial visit out of the way and she has stopped talking about the bad ("jaman") nurse that gave her the shots, I guess it's time to plan round two.
385	Please let me know the appropriate timing to schedule a follow-up visit for further immunizations.
385	Thanks Shelley Corman
386	I worked on the grade level promtion.
386	I didn't know what her new title was supposed to be.
386	Lynn chcecked with Fran and she told her coordinator.
386	So I guess we'll have to check back in with Fran
387	I think your outlined measures sound fine.
387	I would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately.
388	Got your note.
388	I'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my Blackberry.
388	I'll review and send you a note over the weekend
389	Okay I'll go for a ticket.
389	Are you back in town.
389	Do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch.
390	This isn't the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.
390	I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.
390	The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate.
390	.
390	We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing -- as this would take agreement of our partners.
391	Cyndi, I have misplaced Lori Schroeder's cell phone number and need to set an appointment with her before Sat!
391	Help.
391	Thanks for getting together Sat.
391	-- even if I am bad at picking movies.
392	Could you please be so kind as to send me the full shower address list back (my list was missing some addresses).
392	I want to make sure I get organized to send out thanks after the party.
393	Hope your week is going well.
393	Here are a couple of things I wanted to tell you.
393	1.
393	I made the arrangements for the house rental, bought 8 baseball tickets each to two of the games where I thought day of the game seats would be hard to come by & got our airline tickets.
393	2.
393	Hopefully you got the invitation from Cyndi/Rosemary for Sat.
393	I know you have Karate plans that day so I understand if it doesn't suit you.
393	If you decide to come let me know though.
393	Grandpa is willing to come and stay with Chad (Kim will be in Indonesia), but I wanted to also see what D&T will be up to.
393	3.
393	Does any day this week suit you for exercise - walk/run?
393	Shelley
394	Hi Georgi, It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier circumstances from your end.
394	I know that your visited with Mike and Steve on gas control openings.
394	Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.
394	I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding to upcoming job postings.
395	Congrats to you.
396	My thoughts are written into the document
397	Can they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?
397	I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.
397	Can you see about getting Alina a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM (or at 1 PM) ?
397	Is it time for Chad to have an appointment again?
397	Chad has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.
397	Alina has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.
397	We may go to the zoo after that.

400	I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.
400	We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.
400	Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.
400	Thank you Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)
401	Not at this time.
401	I plan to continue to use my personal American Express.
402	Please feel free to give me a call anytime.
402	Work is better.
402	Home is still kind of crazy!
403	I love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.
403	I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and if you send me your mailing address I'll send them.
403	I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.
403	Let me know either way about your decision.
403	If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.
404	Somewhere convenient to Jim since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.
404	Will he come down Wetheimer?
404	If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?
404	Or if he comes down I-10n then ??
405	She has absolutely everything.
405	A gift isn't necessary.
405	I'm working on family pictures for her -- so a recent one of you guys would be great.
405	And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.
405	Call me anytime for info.
405	I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.
405	Tracey is coming next weekend.
405	We'll be in State College around July 4.
405	Keep me posted!
406	Pressure to finish my review!
406	My husband is in Indonesia on business, so don't be surprised if I reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and I can concentrate
407	What a nice note.
407	I hope you are feeling better.
408	Met sounds good
409	Great.
409	Thanks again for going out of your way to meet Alina and join in the party welcoming her.
409	You're the best!
410	FYI
411	Jayshree - give me a call this afternoon at your convenience.
411	I've fact checked the IM and have a couple of questions for you and some language suggestions.
412	Sounds good.
412	I'll give you my handwritten notes.
413	Yes - you name the time
414	Yes
415	I'm fine with the 1-2% growth rate, but think we need to make an assumption about the major contracts that expire 10/31/03.
416	Thank you for your update.
416	Our hearts are very heavy today for Rich and his family.
417	Jayshree - here are some thoughts on the IM.
417	I still can't tie to the top customer revenue figures.
417	Please give me a call to compare notes.
418	That's so sweet.
418	Sorry our time on the phone was short this morning.
418	As you well know, 6:50 AM is chaos at our house!
418	My sister is coming this weekend.
418	She arrives on Sat.
418	at 11 AM and leaves on Tues.
418	Since you get home late Sat, I am anticipating that you'll want to sleep on Sunday.
418	Sunday afternoon we are going to Mary Beth Schatzman's birthday party at a Mexican restaurant.
418	Sunday morning the kids choir sings.
418	Last night the Kudla's came over and we ate take-out.
418	Christopher broke one of the plates on the wall in the dining room and was very active.
418	I was pretty tired by the time I got everyone to bed.
418	Work is very stressful this week.
418	Tonight we are going to try to make it to Karate and we have to write out everyone's Valentine's cards.
418	I love you too.
419	Can you please take care of this?
420	Help
421	Lynn and Steve will attend for me.
422	Mike, Per your request for information to assist you on a NM tax matter, attached is a summary of measured receipts into the Transwestern system by state for the period April 2001 to June 2001.
422	Best Regards, Shelley Corman
423	Perfect!
423	Thanks.
424	Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.
424	I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.
424	Please let Ricki know about your availability.
424	I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.
424	In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).
424	Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.
424	Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.
424	Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.
424	Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.
424	Thanks
425	I love you too.
425	Thanks for the surprise.
425	Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.
425	He especially loved the special kiss.
425	They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat.
425	Man I don't want to get sick again.
425	Happy Valentine's Day
426	I can do any of these dates.
426	If we go to lunch on Feb 19 -- then my sister will be along with us.
427	Please advise
428	Sorry I missed you this morning.
428	Could you take a look at this description from the outline.
428	I checked with John O'Shea and its fine for us to work together on this.
428	I'm back in my office.
428	Please give me a call at your convenience (x37083) Competitive Threats Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.
428	Minnesota: ?
428	Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.
428	Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance).
428	Iowa: ?
428	Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.
428	Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.
428	?
428	With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.
428	To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.
428	The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.
428	Major competitors in the market area include: ?
428	Alliance ?
428	ANR Great Lakes ?
428	Natural Gas Pipeline ?
428	Northern Border ?
428	Trailblazer Viking
429	Saturday night sounds good.
429	My sister will be here!
429	Things are going fine at home...but we'll be happy to have Kim home!
430	Greg, Typically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials.
430	Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement.
430	We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs?
431	Any numbers for me?
432	Can you send me the latest version?
432	Also, I am expecting to shortly have the power plant numbers to add for the 1 market and 1 southend power plant per year based on actual annualized revenues from a recent market power plan (Great River) and southend (PowerTex).
433	Great Rosemary, I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party.
433	You are the best.
433	My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too.
433	We're going to be out shopping that day.
434	I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).
434	Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.
434	Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.
434	In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.
434	I need you authorization to move their telephones.
434	This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.
434	Thank you for the support.
435	It's not final yet.
435	I'll forward the latest copy that Jayshree sent me yesterday afternoon.
435	I still need to check that all our comments were added.
436	FYI
437	I'll gladly bring my photo album and Alina.
437	Chad has a playdate at a neighbors house.
437	Gaby told me that she cannot attend.
437	You mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 12:30 pm.
437	My sister is arriving in town for a visit around 12PM and a cab is picking her up at the airport.
437	I currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house (probably around 1 PM).
437	Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement.
437	I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.
437	She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.
437	I inadvertently dropped her name from the list.
437	Thank you for everything you do.
437	I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness.
437	Shelley
438	Here are a few more minor edits I saw in the latest IM
439	Kevin, We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).
439	But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.
440	I j found three more minor nits.
441	Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number.
441	In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.
441	So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.
442	We should change all refernces to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues .
442	I changed that in one prior draft.
442	The other figure is the top 15 contracts.
442	I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats
443	There are a couple of slides in the recent bank package NNG prepared and a few more slides in the original 2002 budget package.
443	I'm a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up
444	Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.
444	The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.
444	So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.
444	I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case
445	Tomorrow morning!
446	Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange).
446	I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.
446	Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen?
446	Are they the designee?
446	Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?
447	Can I see the Trunkline OBA too
448	I just got this message.
448	I assume it is an old message or do you have a new injury?
449	In addition to the post-it note, please record the following items: 6576 Lynn Blair $75 * Also - please make sure to record the approx.
449	$2200 deposit I made while you wer gone.
449	Thanks
450	Rick I need you to work out a full budget for this class & the Houston class -- both the customer portion + the individual employee travel expenses that will hit our budget.
450	Once you have the cost estimate together, lets sit down and make sure we're okay from an overall budget perspective and then make sure that the participating staff know that we need to stick to the budget.
450	What did we put in the 2002 plan for the TW contract training?
451	Are you at all worried that this starts the move to zone rates in the market area?
451	Do we care?
451	Are we worried about having competitive Zone E/F rates?
452	When you have a chance - can we talk about this?
453	2:30 works for me.
454	Please coordinate a meeting next week between Don Hawkins, myself and Rod Hayslett for Don & I to discuss a proposal for NNG Measurement with Rod.
455	Another concern I have is that once we say that we can path -- then we've lost our best argument against physical segmentation.
456	Rod, I received Don's memo before I sent out the memo that we had talked about -- so I turned the thoughts into reply comments.
457	FYI
458	Would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.
458	The Audubon lady said that I can sign Chad up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.
458	Summer Schedule I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).
458	June 10-14 is Grace VBS We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7 Ashford VBS July 22-26 Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.
458	I'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either): June 24-28 July 8-12 July 15-19
459	Yes I can either meet you at noon or at 3 PM take your pick.
459	I have to take the Kid's to a b-day party from 1:30-3PM -- Kim can watch them afterwards.
459	I'd like to go to Neiman Marcus last call.
460	How did you make sure it was the right set?
460	Will it be delivered?
460	I,m so excited.
460	This will make my week.
461	can you resend.
461	There was no attachment
462	FYI Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours.
462	Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza.
462	After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator.
462	It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out.
462	We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled.
462	Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.
462	We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.
463	I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.
463	I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.
463	But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.
463	I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.
463	If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.
463	I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.
464	Wednesday will work best for me.
464	Say 11:45 at the Daily Review?
465	Would one of be able to email this gentleman.
465	He called me again this morning looking for information on connecting a well to Northern.
466	Ricki - would you please: 1.
466	Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for Judy Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt 2.
466	Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow 3.
466	Move my Wed.
466	staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).
466	Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself
467	I'm confused how this fits in with the projects that we recently had Dynegy approve.
467	Is this one of the discretionary network upgrade projects that they agreed to support?
467	Or one of the other discretionary projects that we didn't have funding for before 6/30/02 anyway?
468	I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.
468	We just pulled schedules from the web.
468	My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.
468	I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us ....
468	but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.
469	Per my earlier email --- this is the maintenance company's response.
470	Thanks for your concern.
470	While it was very scary for Helen, I'm satisfied with Randy's reply.
471	I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.
471	It is true I have other offers, but none are new -- I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.
471	I'll let you know when I figure it out!
472	Tim, Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.
472	How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.
472	Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?
472	How big is this point?
473	Here are a few thoughts.
474	Tim - The denominator in the load factor calculations needs to be updated.
474	Please check with Mike to get the current denominator for the months.
475	Yes
476	18.
476	The primary term of this Agreement shall be from the Effective Date until cancelled upon fortyeight (8)-eight (48) hours prior written notice prior to the gas day by either Party or by other provisions herein.
477	Ann, Per Rod Hayslett, you are able to process changes to list B to accommodate instances in which Dynegy & ETS can agree on the specific assignment of an individual.
477	Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva are both currently company 179 employees.
477	We moved both of these individuals to list C because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for TW.
477	Craig Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B. Dave Neubauer has requested that Craig be moved to list B and both Rick Dietz (Craig's immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.
477	And, if we agree to move Craig to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for Esther DaSilva.
477	Dave Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.
477	Accordingly, please move Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva from List C to List B. FYI - we will use another contract position vacancy to cover TW deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary.
477	Thanks Shelley
478	Don - I never heard anything back.
478	Is everyone ok with these clarifications?
479	I'll await Mike's email.
479	Thanks.
480	Ditto Happy Birthday From Me Too!
480	Was I the first D-In-Law to wish you Happy Birthday?
481	Let's see if Sheila can attend too
482	Sounds good.
482	Is Marion comfortable with the plan?
483	Thanks.
483	I'll keep you posted.
484	Can you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team.
484	It was in the budget and we had the okay, but now I'm hearing there is some hold-up & the units are stored on 44.
484	Shelley
485	Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?
485	My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.
486	I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.
486	The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases: 1.
486	By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.
486	2.
486	With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.
486	Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.
486	Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.
486	The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.
486	The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.
486	The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct. -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.
487	I didn't understand we were borrowing them.
487	I thought we already reached agreement to buy them.
488	I recently received a Schedule K-1 form from SSB.
488	I sending you an overnight package with the form to add to my other tax materials.
488	Thanks Shelley Corman
489	Yes.
489	Of course I'm still here.
489	I think my NNG friends are spreading the rumor that I'm out of here!
489	But, I just keep busy with my day to day work and try to put of making any decisions...
490	I haven't visited with Stan lately.
490	Why do you ask?
490	I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for.
490	I'll try to sit Down with him next week.
490	I'm not planning on doing anything this week.
491	What is an Ambassador Doll and where can I buy one?
492	FYI
493	No idea.
493	Let me know if you hear something.
494	Alina's Dr. appt is at 10 in the medical center.
494	We'll have to have her go first at the dentist in case the dentist appointment runs long?
494	I was planning pasta for dinner.
494	I am not going to the Bunco game until 7 PM.
494	Chad should be in a really good mood -- since I put the treasure map in his lunch to find his post Stanford 9 Test present (Battletops) when he gets home.
495	Mike - Alina & I have decided to join Kim & Chad at the Aeros game tomorrow night, so we'll get the boys together for another event soon.
495	Shelley
496	Per our earlier process discussion ...
497	See my follow-up email
498	I approve.
499	Thanks for the update.
500	Rita, I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co.
500	(366) all year.
500	Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.
500	Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?
500	Shelley Corman
501	Mike, I've never received any feedback on my notes.
501	Can you give me some direction on whether my assumptions are correct?
502	Thanks for talking to Ange.
502	I'll give her a call tonight.
502	My preference is for me to take 3/17; you to take 3/24 (I'll have company); and no children's church on Easter.
502	Let me know what you think.
502	Shelley
503	I've lost track of the email replies -- please just let me know the final time.
504	I approve of the below-noted access.
504	Shelley Corman Vice President, ETS Gas Logistics
505	No change.
505	We are to retain all documents.
506	I'm okay with providing your attached sheet to Jane
507	Great.
507	Just wanted to make sure I was on the right wave length -- as Jane Joyce has asked the IT folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and I didn't want to lead the IT folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect.
508	You are going to be so very mad at me, but I have lost my ATM card.
508	Can you cancel my card.
508	I think this proves that I am no allowed to have an ATM card in the future.
508	Call me.
509	It's been canceled.
509	There were no unauthorized withdrawals.
509	It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.
509	It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.
509	The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features.
510	Still working...for today anyway.
510	We spent a cold weekend in Conroe TX.
510	Alina was well-behaved all weekend.
510	Can you do lunch this week?
510	Perhaps tomorrow?
511	Okay with me
512	Caroline, I'll have to do this by phone with you.
512	Chad is sick.
512	Kim stayed home this AM, but I'm planning to work from home this afternoon.
513	Mr. Chad is sick today with a 102 fever.
513	Kim stayed home this AM, but I have to relieve him and work from home this PM...so I need to reschedule lunch.
513	I really need to talk to you though.
513	Could you go for coffee or a quick dinner this evening on your way home assuming John is headed to Kingwood?
514	We'll have a brief meeting at nine
515	Unfortunately I didn't write down the name of the person in payroll that returned my call to the main payroll number.
515	Whoever it was logged into their system and said that the record showed you making the co.
515	change.
515	Could you give payroll a call?
516	I need for Mike to carry a Blackberry.
516	Please advise on how to make this happy for Mike.
516	Shelley Corman VP Gas Logistics
517	FYI
518	Sorry - but it looks like you'll soon be saddled with a Blackberry
519	Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.
519	I'll have my cell phone with me too.
519	We will be back on Fri.
519	Mar 15.
519	Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion: April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.
519	FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.
519	She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.
519	I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).
520	Thanks I found this too.
521	Jim I would be happy to do my usual Spring bedding flower planting, but I will be out of town on our Spring break trip on Sat.
521	Mar 9.
521	Please advise on whether you/the trustees would like me to add some new bedding plants around the trees, memorial and church entrance the following weekend on Mar 15.
522	I am looking to schedule a Vacation Bible School Training Meeting.
522	I am wondering whether there are any conflicts on the church calendar if I schedule this meeting for May 5, 12-2?
522	Shelley Corman
523	I'm back.
523	I was gone all of two minutes.
523	I needed a bathroom break.
523	I figured out that the straw was simply the 2 or 3 issue and so I didn't bother to chime in when I returned.
524	Sorry but I'm hostage in. Meeting in 39c1.
524	I'll catch up wti you tomorrow.
525	Chris, I was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.
525	However, I'm confused by the update.
525	The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.
525	Is that really where we are sending our registration information?
525	What about the autobiography.
525	What is that, What is required?
525	I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.
525	But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.
525	Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.
525	I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.
525	When to apply for SS#.
525	What about readoption.
525	Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc. I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.
525	I need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.
525	Shelley Corman
526	Thanks.
526	I won't be home until 6.
526	Have meeting ,.
526	Will call when I leave
527	Let it rip
528	John - please drop Mike a line about the Contracts system implementation on TW on Monday AM as Mike is attending Stan's staff meeting for me.
529	I don't plan for us to sign on, we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote.
530	Great.
530	Thanks!
531	Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule.
531	-- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.
531	I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.
531	FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!
532	Florida is great.
532	We have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.
532	But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.
532	And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.
532	Disney was great and I've been to 8 baseball games.
532	Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.
532	See you Monday
533	See you soon!
534	I can either plant this Sat or next.
534	If you guys already mulched last week, then I can manage the planting on my own.
534	If not, I could use help with mulching the beds before I plant.
535	Have a great trip.
535	I'll be thinking of you.
536	Call me when you get to the office.
536	I have been thinking of you constantly this last week and am anxious to hear your voice.
536	Have a great week back at the office.
537	I have received the revised W-2 forms from Enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.
537	(See letter in the package of information that I previously delivered to you).
537	Evidently Enron failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees.
537	I will fedex the revised W-2 forms to you.
537	I would like to set up a date (perhaps over the lunch hour one day) to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home (either rental or sale to my mother and/or her fianc?).
537	Shelley Corman
538	I'm fine with not having Children's Church Palm Sunday -- recognizing that we won't have CC for 3 weeks then.
538	I'll adjust the curriculum notes accordingly and we'll pick up with Children's Church on April 14.
539	Please let me know if there is a time in the day that you would like me to meet with or great your TECO guests.
540	Yes, I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year.
540	I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat.
540	morning at plant at the church.
540	If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated).
540	I think we could get the planting done in about an hour.
540	Congrats to you on your recent wedding.
540	I am so thrilled for you both.
541	FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.
541	I really enjoyed our talk last night.
541	You gave me some really good advice.
541	I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.
541	I think Alina would love the water rafting.
541	We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.
541	Talk to you soon.
541	Chad really, really wants to have Tom come over to play soon!
542	Please plan to get together tomorrow, March 20 from 3-4 PM in 39C1 for a staff meeting.
542	We can talk about the new Enron severance policy, the return of the personal best award program or anything else that is on your mind.
542	If you have issues that you know that you would like me to address please drop me an email today so that I can do some research and be better prepared to answer your questions.
542	Shelley
543	OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.
543	Summary notes from Tom Mertz -There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.
543	- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
543	- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.
543	But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.
543	And it is nearing the bank/shore.
543	- Going to do fly over.
543	- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard.
543	Coast Guard will meet us at site.
543	- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup -There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.
544	FYI
545	Let me know if you are okay with these and I will forward to Stan
546	Jennifer, Regrettably I will not be able to attend the April 19 meeting of the dinner.
546	Please pass my best wishes on to both Dean Dutton and Professor Kleit for a successful meeting.
546	Shelley Corman
547	The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.
547	There are three main principles behind the current rules: 1.
547	Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 2.
547	Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and 3.
547	Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.
547	There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.
547	For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.
547	But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.
547	There was a real case to this effect.
547	The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.
547	The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.
547	FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.
547	So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.
548	New rules propose to: 1.
548	Expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate 2.
548	Require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates
549	Thanks, I needed a little bedtime reading!
550	No material impact .
550	The filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules.
551	Ricki - I don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that I pitched to HR and Lynn and Donna are out -- so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon?
552	Hi Bev, Just checking in. What is the latest on your travel time frame?
552	Hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you.
552	Shelley
553	Or are you still swamped from being out of the office.
554	Let me know how your Drs appt goes.
554	I'll have to let you know later about Fri.
554	-- got some scheduling things up in the air.
555	Let me know what you think about April 12 as a possible San Marcos date.
555	Second choice would be April 5.
556	I have another meeting at 3.
556	I'll join you late if I can.
556	I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.
556	This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.
556	These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.
556	Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.
557	Great
558	Are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets (est. cost $10,000)?
558	Would need to be split 10 ways to be doable?
559	Here's my first stab Key Findings 1.
559	With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.
559	The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close 2.
559	The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through 3.
559	There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.
559	Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF.
559	4.
559	The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.
559	Recommendations 1.
559	Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations (Gas Logistics).
559	2.
559	Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters.
559	3.
559	Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close.
559	4.
559	Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.
560	I can make that work for Chad if that is when Drew is available.
560	I assume you are talking about Wk of June 24?
561	I agree with your strategy
562	Brad Holmes Steve January Lynn Blair Mike Bryant Donna Scott (vac) Sheila Nacey (vac) Rick Dietz Lindy Donoho Mark McConnell Michelle Lokay Kevin Hyatt * Individuals noted will be on vacation -- but you should probably send an invite anyway.
563	Please remember that you guys are to stop by Stan's office first at 10:30
564	How about Monday?
565	Thanks of your words of encouragement.
566	Please add to my calendar
567	Teb - would you have time to brainstorm with me on some middle of the road rate treatment scenarios on Monday?
568	Stan told me that you were using that title too.
568	So I guess perhaps I negotiated another thing as well.
568	Seriously though I would like to talk to you about using common titles.
569	Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.
569	Here is the short version.
569	Yes I have a new job.
569	But, surprise, it's still at Enron.
569	I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.
569	We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.
569	The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.
569	On the other hand we could just relax pool side.
569	We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.
569	Just let me know your leisure preferences.
570	I am going to be available in a few minutes
571	Ricki Change of Plans --- Please change to Shelley A. Corman Sr. VP & Chief Commercial Officer and get my new room location.
571	Thanks
572	What does this mean??????
572	Will it affect my Blackberry?
572	Will it affect the ability to check email at
573	Please approve these requests
574	I don't plan to attend the NNG customer accts meeting
575	Yes - I will be moving to Steve's old offices
576	Thanks for your support.
576	I'm sure that I'll be taking you up on your offer soon.
577	Sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby.
577	I just had my head in the clouds.
577	Have a great evening!

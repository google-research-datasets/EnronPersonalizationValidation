0	It would be great to have the check by the end of the week.
0	Thanks you.
0	Mat
1	Email and phone conversation at the same time!
2	Don't get too excited to hear about the rest of the day...I don't have much positive to write.
2	It's been boring and I'm very uneasy about my role in this group.
2	More later...
2	Mat
3	Yes, I'm scheduling for the West desk, so I need whatever software package is required.
3	Thanks.
4	Sorry for the no call.
4	I was busy until about 10 pm and....well I just got Anyway, I'll call you later...ok?
4	I promise.
4	Mat
5	It's funny, even the southern ones.
5	How was your night?
5	Please send e-mail to my compuserve account from now on (mds12403@cs.com).
5	Thanks.
5	Mat
6	Regan, Hey, I hope things are still going well.
6	I've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.
6	I'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.
6	However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics.
6	The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes.
6	As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders.
6	My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.
6	Let's just say my plate looks to be full.
6	By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.
6	Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.
6	For instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program.
6	It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.
6	I also saw mention of a mentoring program.
6	Of course, the A/A happy hours important as well.
6	I'd like to know more.
6	Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at Enron.
6	You can reach me at 3-0472.
6	Later, Mat
7	Lunch on Friday sounds great.
7	Mat
8	Hey, I just wanted to pass along my phone numbers for future reference: Office: 3-0472 Home: 713-784-8180 Cell: 832-444-7702 By the way, I finally spoke with Jennifer today.
8	She would like to get together with us for a few beers whenever we decide.
8	Mat
9	Thanks, Gwen.
10	Hey, I hope you've gotton a chance to get a phone any everything.
10	I finally have access to all the computer applications that I need.
10	If only I had access to the directories with the required files!
10	Anyway, I wondering what you thought about drinks after work thursday and if you had any venue preference?
10	Mat
11	Marlo, As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested information.
11	Each spreadsheets are identified by month.
11	Within each spreadsheet are a number of tabs.
11	Based on the customers you mentioned on the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.
11	Customers are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.
11	For each customer, several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from each location.
11	Please call if you have any further questions.
11	Mat
12	I didn't forget, I'm just new to Lotus...
13	Marlo, Can you please forward that email you sent me to Patti Sullivan since I have not used the path manager and my mail forward feature is not working.
13	Thanks.
13	Mat
14	Yo, you about ready?
15	Don't mess with Texas.....especially the women!
16	Hey, I didn't call you back because of the fuckup that I learned of right after you hung up on me.
16	I'm sorry.
17	Reagan, Charles just got a phone call for you!
17	Apparently, his phone number is listed in the directory for you.
17	Since I didn't remember your number, we told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.
17	His name is Ted Spackey with Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had a great time.
17	Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.
17	I get half way in the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.
17	I hung out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.
17	Random.
17	The broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and he's moving back East.
17	Anyway, I'm exhausted.
17	No partying for me tonight.
17	Mat
18	Dear GEICO, I have no idea who those people are that are identified in your email.
18	I would be interested in knowing how some random peoples' driving incidents are some how associated with me and my insurance application.
18	I have never had an insurance claim.
18	Please feel free to contact me with any further questions.
18	Mathew Smith Dear Mr. Smith: Thank you for your request for auto insurance.
18	Please provide the details requested below to expedite the processing of your request.
18	We routinely run a claims history for all new policies and the following claims were found.

18	Sincerely, GEICO DIRECT
19	The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.
19	It says 6 pm, but whatever.
19	I'll probably go then.
19	If you guys aren't ready, maybe I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.
19	Mat
20	I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I will pass it on.
20	When would your rotation begin and would this be a second or third rotation?
20	Mat
21	I would look at it again, but I'm late for my class.
21	The only way to reach me is by pager - 713-716-0795.
21	Sorry, Mat
22	Well, thank you for the clarification.
22	I was confused because I was hanging out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.
22	I mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say about you.
22	Hope all is well.
22	Mat
23	Just wanted to let you know that I passed your resume on to the desk director.
23	Mat
24	Tuesday is good for me as far as I could tell.
24	Mat
25	ENRON ROCKS!
26	I'm not visiting you.
26	You're just a place to lay my head.
27	email
28	I will be attending the happy hour on Thursday.
28	Mathew Smith Associate, West Gas Trading
29	Pedro, I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.
29	Is LPG a commodity?
29	Gas pipeline?
29	Pooling point?
29	Let me know, and I'll see what I can do.
29	Mathew Smith
30	I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.
30	I would prefer a month long stay.
30	Ammenities required include, very large hot tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large (I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, and a chef.
30	I also require that you keep me informed of the attending women.
30	I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to take advantage of such ammenities..
30	Gracious.
30	With love and anticipation of a memorable trip, Mateo.
31	Brief, Sorry for being such a loser by not getting in touch with you a little sooner.
31	It's totally my fault.
31	Anyway, I do want to catch up with you sometime.
31	Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.
31	So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.
31	I'm getting in early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.
31	I'll give you a call sometime this week.
31	When are the best times to get a hold of you?
31	Here's some digits for you: You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.
31	I usually work till around 6 pm.
31	Anyway, I speak to you soon.
31	El Presidente
32	OK
33	Thursday definitely no...friday maybe.
33	Also Dave Shank is in town to work with Marine this week.
33	You remember Dave don't you?
34	What are we going to do, Brief.
34	I can only say that will probably hit the City sometime during the upcoming holidays.
34	I will promise to give you some warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day this time...
34	Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.
34	I had a nice time at home and I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.
34	I give you a call soon.
34	Mat
35	Make sure you take care of Dave...
36	Awesome dude!
36	I'll definitely be around.
36	Hey, maybe you can bring my wine (or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).
36	Mat
37	Mi casa es su casa.
37	I've got plenty of room.
37	Hey what's this I hear about you and Heather looking for a plot of land?
38	Pablo, Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not accessible before 7 am?
38	For your reference the error message is below.
38	The address is Error 500--Internal Server Error From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1: 10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
38	Thanks.
38	Mat
39	Everything went well, and you?
39	We are suppose to hear today!
39	I don't know what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.
39	Let me know when you do, and I'll do the same.
39	I'm sure we both did fine, since they didn't give us the technical tests.
40	I need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that I don't already know.
41	Any news yet?
42	huh?
43	I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program.
43	Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates.
43	It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far.
43	I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.
43	Early today three of the six people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info.
44	Cool.
44	I actually left a message with Ted, but obviously I've heard nothing.
45	Thanks.
46	Mark, Did we not already do this?
46	Mat
47	Aah, thanks for the clarification.
48	Damn it!
48	What did I say?
48	Do you read your emails or what?
48	I want descriptions!
48	I want chicks.
48	I need a chick.
48	I need a really cool chick to hang out with.
49	My response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks.
50	Seriously, you better fucking call me.
50	Mark's away and I'm lonely.
51	no.
52	Hey, you still coming to H-town?
53	Hey, I, for some reason, just got your email.
53	Anyway, I'll try to call you later in the morning, but if you want to call me at work my # is 713-853-0472.
53	Talk to you soon.
53	Mat
54	I agree.
54	Everything is just peachy up here.
54	My scheduling group wants me to stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.
54	He also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how this "track" will actually affect me.
54	Happy hour tomorrow?
54	Mat
55	Jeanie, As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El Paso, TW, Williams, etc. Do you need any more info?
55	Do you have any more info on how this program is going to be structured?
55	If so, I'd be interested.
55	See you around, Mat
56	Hey, are you there..............................?
57	Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.
57	I was thinking about old times.
57	I can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically hear you yacking on the phone....or whispering to Jimmy....
58	Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to refresh it manually.
58	It sucks....
58	So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be thinking of.
58	Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.
58	Later.
58	Mat
59	Hey, do you have instant messenger?
59	You're the type of person that would utilize it to its fullest potential.
59	Anyway, I have it, and I think you should so you can send me an instant message.
60	Well, will discuss that later.
60	Call me whenever you want.
60	Mat
61	Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.
61	How about that Instant Messenger, though.
61	Just think, you'd be able to send me a message and I instantly read it.
61	Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.
62	Total price for this trip: $268.50 Here is a detailed description of the flight(s) you selected, along with any rules and restrictions that apply.
62	1 Review the flight details Fri 5-Jan-01 4hr 0mn New York (LGA) Depart 3:00 PM to Houston (IAH) Arrive 6:00 PM Flight: 1975 Economy/Coach Class, Snack, Boeing 737-300, 60% on time Total miles: 1415 mi Total flight time: 4hr 0mn Sun 7-Jan-01 Depart 5:47 PM to New York (LGA) Arrive 10:00 PM Flight: 1974
63	The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.
63	On American, the one's I sent are the about the only ones.
63	Continental has many available flights for about $35 more.
63	Mat
64	Sure, unless I'm on a flight.
65	Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.
65	Definitely going to bed early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9.
66	So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?
66	As in, what people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.
66	My update is that the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.
66	As lucky as I am, it's probably the worst one for everyone.
66	Hey, do you think you could send me emails of all of those going.
66	I think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance.
66	Mat
67	Leo, Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of the drawbacks to working for a large company.
67	Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct.
67	The extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.
67	Joanne and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities referenced in a particular order.
67	This relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order.
67	For instance, if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities.
67	This would not be possible (or at least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.
67	So yes, you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database.
67	As far as actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.
67	I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be happy to with a little notice.
67	Mat
68	Kristen, How often do you check your cell phone and email for messages?
68	Mat
69	Tracy, I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation beginning February 12th.
69	If possible I would like to attend a portion of the activities.
69	Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and Risk sessions would be of value to me.
69	Please let me know if I can still attend these sessions.
69	Thank you.
69	Mathew Smith
70	Kristen, Just wanted to let you know that I didn't get any emails from you last night or today.
71	Steve, Hey, what's up my friend?
71	I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).
71	I'm assuming that you are, indeed, still there.
71	I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.
71	It's been great, though.
71	Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.
71	Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than Pirnie.
71	My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch, and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
71	I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.
71	Anyway...
71	I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.
71	So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.
71	So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.
71	If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
71	Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.
71	Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.
71	By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.
71	Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!
71	Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.
71	Take care, Mat
72	Louis, When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not currently).
72	I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have obtained Enron parking.
72	I signed my name to a list that you circulated at orientation.
72	Is there something further that I need to do?
72	Mathew Smith
73	Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip.
74	Steve, I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities.
74	What are the chances of a follow-on tour?
74	Won't the contract be renewed?
74	If your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?
74	Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.
74	The later the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity.
74	I'll give a call sometime, but I don't think I have the number anywhere.
74	Can you send it to me?
74	FYI, my numbers Later dude.
75	That is good to hear.
75	Give me a call today as you indicated.
75	Mat
76	FYI How are you feeling today?
76	I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I actually feel pretty good.
76	I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said Icould definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the eof jan and his tour might be over!
76	still waiting to hear whether a non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other yearI thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work downthere.
76	Interesting....
76	anyway, I finally got signed up for the continentaltravel specials.
76	I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go toLouisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.
76	I'd take advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its alittle late to switch with somebody.
76	Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.
76	Later....
76	Continental Airlines on 01/03/2001|
77	Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.
77	Malo means bad.
77	I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.
77	The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.
77	Neither of us wanted to do it, and Ted got stuck with it.
77	Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.
77	Socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country.
77	Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.
77	It's not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.
77	I think I might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while.
77	I feel bad.
77	Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.
77	Of course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!
77	Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for
78	Matt, I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing.
78	I'm working this weekend so I'll give it a go.
78	Thanks.
78	Mat
79	That;'s funny.
79	I must have missed your call the other day.
79	Mark must not have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.
79	Regardless, I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.
79	You could also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.
79	Mat
80	Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :( I just want to be loved.... Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call later. I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off. Mat
81	Brief, You name the time and the place between 2:30 pm Friday January 12th through 12 pm Monday January 15th!
81	Pres
82	OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
82	I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon.
82	One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your email.
82	I can't believe it!
82	The worst part about it is that, yes, I am planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the point of my email this morning!
82	HOLY SHIT!
82	THAT SUCKS!
82	I can't believe you're not going to be there.
82	When are you leaving/coming back?
82	I try to call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless since my Palm Pilot crashed).
82	Anyway, again, this is freaky.

84	Cheryl, I will be attending the reception on Thursday for the A/A program.
84	Thanks.
84	Mathew Smith
85	Good Morning.
85	Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided not to take the chance of waking you.
85	So did you have a good time?
85	Who did you go with?
85	I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you little party animal.
85	That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!
85	Oh I bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering.
85	Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in. If I kick ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading book.
85	Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?
85	He said his dinner went well, and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.
85	Anyway, I have to run.
85	Have a nice day.
85	Mat
86	Hey, are you at work today?
87	Did you have fun last night?
88	Are you busy?
89	I want my bed, too.
89	Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I can go out later.
89	If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam for NYC baby.
89	The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think we're losing a bunch of money today.
89	Oh well, it's the new year.
89	Don't you want to hear about my new project, though?
89	I can tell because you're so inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.
89	Later.
90	Well it's good to hear from you.
90	I'm glad the skiing was good.
90	I'm jealous, although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of skiing!
90	I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still available.
90	I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I realized it was a check...cool.
90	So, when do you think the rest will be on the way.
90	Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.
90	Give me a call, though.
90	I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.
90	I'm leaving for NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.
90	Stay cool.
90	Mateo.
91	Who are you?
92	So tired I am.
93	Well, it wasn't that bad.
93	I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.
93	I made it to bed by 12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.
93	I have a bunch of work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I have to do, so it's good.
93	Fortunately this scheduling thing has become second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.
93	How are you?
93	Mat
94	Hey, we need to talk.
94	So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.
94	I have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that they are on their way.
94	Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they are not....so what's up?
94	I still need everyone's email because I don't not have those original messages with everyones address on them.
94	I think it would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.
94	I don't know, I guess I just don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know whether I should use it to get in touch with you.
94	Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.
94	I can deal, but its just kind of annoying.
94	I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed quickly.
94	Mat
95	Oh yes, I had a good time, although very exhausted from getting in late.
95	Did you have a good weekend?
95	Hand out with Marky much?
95	I noticed some of my wine stash was depleted.
95	Did you have anything to do with that?
95	Mat
96	Ina, I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.
96	Can you please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.
96	This is required for a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.
96	Let me know if you need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.
96	Thank you.
96	Mat
97	Hey, just wanted to let you know I made $10,000 today (for me that is).
97	Just wanted to tell someone...it's for doing the trading track.
97	Mat
98	Tonight my ass...call me now...713-853-0472.
99	so not even remotely funny.
100	Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got distracted.
100	Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password coded into the file.
100	One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, so that I really don't need access anymore.
100	Apparently I have all the necessary software as well.
100	Thanks.
100	Mat
101	Phillip, I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.
101	Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market.
101	Then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.
101	Initially, I thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included).
101	However, this only works if the person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking.
101	As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.
101	The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each person's storage book for open and closed positions?"
101	Then beyond that, if we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.
101	So, I guess I could apply the model for that purpose.
101	Does this make sense to you?
101	Any comments are appreciated.
101	Thanks.
101	Mat
102	I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.
102	I suppose I'll just keep waiting.
102	Mat
103	Tom, Thanks for the new version.
103	I finally got the other version to work, but only by running it on Ken's computer.
103	I have some questions regarding the summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.
103	I'm free anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.
103	Just name the time and place.
103	I also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time decision making.
103	Speak to you soon.
103	Mat
104	Tom, Here are the two curve files for this year that I have downloaded.
104	Thanks for your help.
104	Mat
105	Kristen, I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.
105	He said that he can't have Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.
105	It was pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that weekend?...well good...."
105	He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.
105	I pushed him to give me details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had time off.
105	I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them (I'm such a skeptic).
105	Anyway, fuck'm.
105	Any ideas?
105	Mat
106	Sorry, I'm busy...work.
107	Brad, What's up cuz?
107	Are the lights on in San Francisco?
107	I think it's only a matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the streets!
107	Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what yet.
107	I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around here and twidle my thumbs.
107	Let me know if you have any suggestions.
107	Mat
108	Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.
108	I am still trying to figure when and where I'm taking vacation.
108	Puerto Rico is right up there, buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?
108	I checked some airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I didn't jump right on this.
108	I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you know what I come up with.
108	Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there.
108	Anyway, I just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.
108	Mat
109	We need to work out a system here Kristen.
109	Why is it you are so freakin hard to get in touch with?
109	I asked you how often you check email, but you've never told me, once a day, week, what?
109	And this cell phone thing...Do you have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from you?
109	I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.
109	Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.
109	Mat
110	Hey, I don't know if you've been reading any of those emails today, but please tell me we (as in me and you) can do something other than hand out with those fucking losers.
110	You know Mark's all over this fucking thing!
111	Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.
111	Soon though.
111	The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go someplace or your place.
111	I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do anyway.
111	It'll be my second to last weekend stint.
111	I'm jealous about you being in NY.
111	Have a drinky for me.
111	I'm going to look for some pussy on saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.
111	Too bad you're away...I'm sure we could do well.
111	Anyway, have fun in NY.
111	Mateo
112	Sara, Yo, what's up?
112	How are things across the street?
112	Let me guess, you got all rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.
112	Unfortunately, I've been extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.
112	Anyway, I haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning which really helped.
112	Poor Ted had to pick the slack.
112	So, any big plans for the weekend besides laundry?
112	Superbowl?
112	Happy hour?
112	Toilet flushing into the phone?
112	Stupid drunk?
112	Mat
113	Andrea, I'm rotating as part of the trading track sometime before March 1st to the Gas Fundamentals Group.
113	I'll get you the required information next week.
113	Thanks.
113	Mat
114	Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.
114	Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.
114	Definitely keep me informed, though.
114	I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold me over.
114	Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.
114	Mat
115	Try to call me at work today and I'll give you the latest fare availability.
115	Talk to you later.
115	Mateo
116	As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat..
116	night, otherwise just partying.
116	Again, you name the time and place, and whoever else might be interested in "getting it done".
116	How's the residency going?
116	Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.
116	Go Syracuse.
117	Tom, I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and delivered the same day as the print.
117	If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily print for April 8th.
117	If we do not change the model, I think we need another sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.
117	Of course, eventually we need to fix the model.
117	Mat
118	I'm going to be working late, and I have some errands I need to run, so I don't really have plans, except that dinner will probably be around 8 pm or so.
118	Mat
119	I have consulted my partner, and it would be great if we could be added to the reservation list.
119	Please pass this on to whoever.
120	Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow Summary sheet: PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.
120	The numbers in the Test Sheet for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for February 5th.
120	I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's website for the 5th.
120	Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.
120	Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.
120	It appears the Test Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.
120	However, the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 7 am (we are not sure why).
120	I understand you may pull the numbers from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier.
120	TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.
120	We pull the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.
120	It looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.
120	They differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the other.
120	To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.
120	PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.
120	The numbers for February 6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.
120	Is this a reporting or a scrubbing problem?
120	It is possible you are pulling the data from the website before they update it with the next day's data.
120	We manually type these numbers in. If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run.
120	El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant receipts.
120	The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because I don't think this is a cycle problem.
120	General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.
120	This can cause intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day fluxuations.
120	Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.
120	I suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day and the previous day.
120	This way we can compare identical cycles as well as pick up any intraday fluxuations.
120	As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.
120	These notes should give us a great place to start.
120	I look forward to getting this report ready to use.
120	Mat
121	What's up?
121	Any news on Pirnie/AFI contract negotiations?
122	No skiing yet.
122	Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.
122	I'm pretty sure I'm going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.
122	Oh well, I need the vacations...
123	Sorry, Jeff and I went to happy hour.
124	What is the deal with this glitter thing?
125	Hey honey, how was the Men's Club?
126	I look forward to the details.....
127	I told you I'd help.
127	Just be patient.
128	Ina, I was not out today.
128	Yesterday and today I was taking a class.
128	I'm sorry I didn't tell anyone, it was a last minute decision.
128	Mat
129	Alexis, I think I'm going to the cookoff, so I'm will have to decline.
129	Sorry.
129	Mat
130	I'll have to think about it.
130	Thanks.
131	Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment (and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm referring to).
131	I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have any suggestions as of yet.
131	I'll see what I can come up with.
131	Mat
132	Indian chick is a party girl.
133	Duncan and Kristen are coming Saturday.
133	I don't know about the Rodeo.
133	Over.
134	Fuck, I'm writing this while I'm chewing on lunch.
135	Hey, I haven't heard from you.
135	Have you bought your Padre tickets?
135	Mat
136	I'll call you tonight.
137	Steve, Yo, what's up?
137	I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the meteorologists...................
137	Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
137	Are you out of a job yet?
137	I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here and take a vacation.
137	Still thinking of your neck of the woods.
137	Got to run.
137	Mat
138	you can send him email on it.
138	I want to know what its about.
138	Mat
139	you didn't answer my question.
140	Jennifer, As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.
140	I may call you tonight or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.
140	I think my friends would like it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.
140	If I don't make it to dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.
140	Mat
141	word.
142	I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.
142	I'm definitely still coming, though.
142	Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me when you're free, and we'll hang out.
142	You and Jess up for dinner?
142	Right now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).
142	I'll be going out afterwards, though.
142	Just let me know.
142	Later.
143	Hey Anna, Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...
143	Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got there.
143	Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to Deans around 12:30 or so.
143	We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.
143	Hope you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.
143	Mat
144	Hey buddy, what's happening?
144	Not much up here these days.
144	I took last week off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.
144	I'm pretty much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.
144	Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.
144	Regardless, any chance of digging them up for me?
144	I may want to talk to them about their bid process.
144	I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.
144	Mat
145	Oh, I had fun as well.
145	I'm glad you guys came.
145	Unfortunately the rest of the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!
145	It's a great story!
145	I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.
145	Give me a call if you want to chat sometime.
145	Mat
146	Tom, I took a few days off and just got back....
146	Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm sure it does.
146	One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work.
146	In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.
146	So, if you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it.
146	I envision a spreadsheet where I list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables.
146	In this way I could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.
146	Would this be just a separate macro?
146	What do you think?
146	Mat
147	Tom, Sounds fine anytime is good.
147	Basically the parameters that need changing are those on the Optimizer sheet: Start/End Date Spreads Max Inj/With rates Max Storage volume Selected Curve Storage Facility I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.
147	Mat
148	Sounds good.
149	Matt, Hey, thanks for returning my call.
149	As you're probably out from work, I'll try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).
149	I basically just wanted to touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic storage project.
149	I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.
149	You may have provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.
149	Thanks again.
149	Mat
150	Of course I knew that.
150	The question is, why were you calling him?
150	ms
151	He's working for realastate management company.
151	very small, but of course, paying better than pirnie.
151	ms
152	I will look at it later today.
153	Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my brother's coming for a week.
153	So, I guess just keep me posted.
153	I took a week off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get away, but certainly did not completely satsify.
153	Still looking for more.
153	Talk to you later.
153	Mat
154	So where the hell was it?
155	both.
156	testing you bitch.
156	mat
157	Hey fucko, give me a call.
157	You should come to NYC this weekend and party with your friends.
158	yo, i'm still coming.
158	saturday would be great.
158	I'm in the city all day and night, and the only plans i have are to go to the game sat.
158	I'll call you when i get a chance.
158	My cell phone is 832-444-7702.
158	Looking forward to seeing you.
158	mat
159	Just one thing, my first name only has one "t" in it.
159	Thanks.
159	Mat Enron North America Corp.
160	Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.
160	I went to NYC for a long weekend.
160	Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.
160	Hope you're having a great time in Utah.
160	If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.
160	Mat
161	Chris, I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list of objectives for me.
161	For your information, the attached table provides the additional items.
161	Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.
161	Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout model objective.
161	Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during her maternity leave.
161	I don't expect these activities to interfere with my fundy responsibilities.
161	Mat
162	i would love to, except for the fact that I have a 4:30 meeting, because of which I had to cancel my flying time!
162	Call me later.
162	and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try my phone or pager 8774892073@pagenetmessage.net in the future.
162	Mat
163	test
164	thanks.
165	Chris, This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.
165	I also discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG that also need to be added to the database.
165	They are included in the attached file on separate sheets.
165	Meters already existing in the database are not included for either pipe.
165	Can you please dump these into the database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet for these meters.
165	Let me know if you have any questions.
165	Thanks.
165	Mat
166	Amanda, Can you please add this link to the fundy website under the Power tab.
166	It should be called "Proposed Gas Generation Plants".
166	Thanks.
166	Mat
167	Chris, Use this file instead.
167	Thanks.
167	Mat
168	Dad told about you changing the ticket, but thanks.
168	Um, i look forward to hearing about this little accident (at least i hope it was little).
169	waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!
169	and, boy did i feel great the next day.
169	Get this....I get on my little rinky dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear this voice................."mat?".
169	I turn and the flight attendant is none other than.........Heather Chapin!
169	Although she offered me all the booz i could drink, i could drink none.
169	i would have eaten some food if offered, but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.
169	Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's team.
169	I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking my green beer.
169	About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.
169	Later, Mateo
170	Ok Chris.
170	this is it.
170	Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the database with unique identifiers.
170	The third tab has four points that need IHS numbers assigned.
170	These four should be assigned to the Questar pipeline.
170	Thanks.
170	Mat
171	Amanda, Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.
171	It should be called Kern Expansion Economics". I don't have a description yet (and I'm still working on the other one I owe you). Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. Mat
172	Orangemen suck.
172	I hate Syracuse.
172	I'm no longer a fan.
173	Amanda, Please move the file i sent you from the Testing tab to the West directory under the Pipeline tab.
173	I have updated it in the Testing tab so discard the version i emailed.
173	Thanks.
173	Mat
174	Orangemen suck.
174	I hate Syracuse.
174	I'm no longer a fan.
175	Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.
175	We'll definitely be hitting the town.
175	Are you around?
175	I may organize something, so I'll let you know.
175	Mat
176	As you requested, here are the West Desk's forecasts for California Reciepts minus instate production by month.
176	They are broken down into delivery points onto Socal and PGE's system.
176	Please let me know if you have any questions.
176	Thanks.
176	Mat
177	Amanda, Please add add a link called "Plant Outages (portland)", to the Gas Fundamentals website under the Power tab.
177	The description is as follows: "Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today."
177	Thanks.
177	Mat
178	i haven't created it yet.
178	I was hoping to have the link there, so that I can put the file in the directory tomorrow morning (before you get in).
178	It will be called "curtailments.xls".
178	Mat Enron North America Corp.
179	thanks.
179	Enron North America Corp.
180	Amanda, Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.
180	Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".
180	Also add the WSCC to the description.
180	In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."
180	The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".
180	Thanks.
180	Mat
181	Mat
182	Ya, it was finalized last thursday night.
182	this should already be in our forecasts.
182	Mat
183	Team, The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each pipeline.
183	Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and highlight in green.
183	Make particular note of any information that will be tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative pipeline.
183	The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.
183	Where appropriate add the IHS DRN.
183	If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT group will create an ID using the description provided.
183	Please let me know if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to incorporate these first thing tomorrow.
183	Call me if you have any questions.
183	Mat
184	that's fine.
184	thanks.
184	Mat
185	Chris, Here are the additional manual entry meters.
185	Those highlighted in blue should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new records.
185	Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will leave up to you.
185	Let me know if you have any questions.
185	Mat
186	Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we discussed.
186	The other report is called West_3.
186	Also, the CIG/WIC report should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.
186	Thanks.
186	Mat
187	why can't you go, or do you just not want to?
188	and you think i'd want to go with them?
188	actually, i thought that they had a ticket for me too.
189	David, Here's the information for the Portland database: Machine name: napdx-sql1 password: fundamentals The Access database I created is located at: O:\\fundy_ops\west The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).
189	The tables for the query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.
189	In general, I think I need two tables.
189	One needs to show each plant and the other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the Plant table).
189	I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the summary table.
189	the other two queries in the Access database are a start.
189	The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the report to look like.
189	It might be good to group the first table by region and then fuel type as well.
189	When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd be happy to discuss it further.
189	Thanks.
189	Mat
190	that bitch.
190	j/k.
190	thanks.
191	Philip, I'm sorry this took so long, I thought I sent it ealier, but apparently not.
191	Let me know if you need anything else.
191	Mat
192	For later.
192	Mat
193	Angela, This file contains the historicals for Socal in the specified format.
193	Can you please dump them into the database.
193	Thanks.
193	Mat
194	Angela, Here are some more historicals for socal (I didn't realize we had these additional years).
194	They are in ADDITION to those already loaded.
194	Thanks.
194	Mat
195	Please make the PGE daily report (#26) available on your website.
195	Thanks.
195	Mat
196	Angela, As discussed, the following file contains hisoricals for PGE.
196	Chris should have deleted data in the database from the middle of March back so you can import anytime.
196	This data goes up to 2/6/01 and Chris will reload from 2/7/01 to present.
196	Thanks.
196	Mat
197	Use this file, NOT the previous one sent.
197	Thanks.
197	Mat
198	Angela, Here's the NWPL historicals.
198	Thanks.
198	Mat
199	Here are the ones I did for you to check against your values.
199	Thanks.
199	Mat
200	new file: Thanks, Mat
201	David, This one is very similar to the one you just did.
201	In fact, the data is almost identical.
201	We download power plant outage data from the California ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape).
201	Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table with key fields: Date and Res Name.
201	The other fields include Type (planned or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity of the outage.
201	So, we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the past.
201	We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only.
201	Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and "Unplanned" by region.
201	A copy of the database is attached.
201	Let me know when you have a chance to start working on it.
201	Thanks.
201	Mat
202	Hey, I'm going to give your resume to this girl, and I'll let you know when to follow up.
202	Mat
203	Jeanie, I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.
203	She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.
203	Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.
203	She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.
203	Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?
203	Any info would be helpful.
203	Thanks.
203	Mat
204	Thanks.
204	I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.
204	She doesn't have a graduate degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.
204	Mat
205	try this.
205	thanks.
205	Mat
206	Angela, Try this one.
206	Thanks.
206	Mat
207	Mog, Here's the Socal file as requested.
207	As I indicated, this information is a competitive advantage of ours, so it should stay in the company.
207	Thanks.
207	Mat
208	Mog, As requested, here is the Socal file.
208	Please keep this within the company, as it represents a competitive advantage to Enron.
208	Thanks.
208	Mat
209	Phillip, Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.
209	Our exposure on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.
209	Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.
209	The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.
209	I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.
209	My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.
209	Mat
210	I am no longer looking for assitance in finding an apartment, but thank you for your attempts at contacting me.
210	Mat
211	The merged reports look great.
211	I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports: 31 Keystone Receipts 15 Questar Pipeline 40 Rockies Production The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.
211	Thanks.
211	Mat PS.
211	Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.
212	Patti, Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.
212	The link is Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).
212	Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.
212	Mat
213	Mike, Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.
213	I made back from a golf outing around 9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.
213	Anyway, I was out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.
213	What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.
213	They have a group that goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.
213	Mat
214	Chris, The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.
214	Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.
214	Thanks.
214	Mat PS.
214	This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week.
215	Angela, It's me, your favorite coworker!
215	Attached is, yet again, an Access file with a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).
215	Before they can be loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN: EBBCLAYHIST Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D Historicals Only" Thanks.
215	Mat
216	new file.
216	try this.
216	Mat
217	Hey, I got an error back because the files were too big.
217	I'll stick them in the dropbox in a folder called scheadul.
217	Mat
218	Anytime you get a chance is fine.
218	Just let me know, but I'll tentatively plan on 3 pm.
218	Mat
219	Angela, CIG (#42) is almost complete, but we have a few data changes to make: First, for DRN 24906 Big Blue Meter Station, please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 with values below listed from 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 and delete records with effective date 4/21/01.
219	Also, please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries.
219	Second, for DRN 16688 Keyes, Town of, please delete both the receipt and delivery records for effective data 4/21/01 and the receipt record for effective date 4/8/01.
219	Thanks.
219	Mat
220	Chris, Please add the following locations for pipeline #42 and populate with indicated flow type..........
220	109489 Bullfrog Meter Station (BUL) R 4065 Desert Springs Meter Station (DES) R,D 41449 Pueblo North Meter Station (PUE) D 2546 Western Sugar Meter Station (WES) D Thanks.
220	Mat PS.
220	We'll probably have a few more for WIC in the next day or so, but let's get these in to finish out CIG.
221	Chris, I assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.
221	Can you check on this.
221	It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.
221	The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.
221	If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.
221	Mat
222	Good point.
222	Let's assign a D to it.
222	Mat
223	thanks.
224	Jody, I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.
224	These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.
224	I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.
224	Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.
224	It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.
224	Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.
224	Mat
225	As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.
225	After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated: #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).
225	Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.
225	In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).
225	Let me know if you have any questions.
225	Mat
226	Chris, I stumbled across a few problems with CIG/WIC.
226	First, location 2776 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type "D" yet new data is scraped with flow type "T".
226	Let's change all D's to T's.
226	Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.
226	Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.
226	Let me know if you have any questions.
226	Thanks.
226	Mat
227	Chris, I think we need a new pipeline for El Paso Manual Entry.
227	We need to enter linepack once a day.
227	Let's call the DRN LinePack and populate with flow type S. Thanks.
227	Mat
228	Chris, More changes............
228	For DRN 34585, please change the utilization value in the usage table for 4/23/01 to zero.
228	Then change the DRN on all of the usage data for 34585 to 34584 and delete location 34585.
228	In addition, please make the following utilization value changes to the usage data for DRN 34584: Thanks again.
228	Mat
229	Chris, Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?
229	Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.
229	As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?
229	Let me know if there are any issues.
229	Mat
230	The value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D. All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).
230	Mat
231	I'm sorry I do not know what this is in regard to.
231	Could you have meant to send it to another Mat Smith?
232	Colin, Great.
232	As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.
232	Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.
232	I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.
232	I'm available today to help any way I can.
232	Thanks.
232	Mat
233	Keith, Take a look at this.
233	Mat
234	Thank you.
235	Dave, As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.
235	The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.
235	Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.
235	We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).
235	Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.
235	If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.
235	Thanks.
235	Mat
236	Tim, Colin and I spent a few minutes on the phone with Bob regarding the outage information we were trying to get.
236	With Bob's help and with the use of your stored procedure we saved a bunch of time.
236	Thanks for your help.
236	Mat
237	Colin, Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....
237	Background: Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".
237	Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".
237	Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).
237	The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.
237	Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".
237	I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.
237	Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.
237	Objective: The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).
237	There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".
237	The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.
237	Format: Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.
237	It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.
237	Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.
237	If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.
237	In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.
237	Thanks for your help.
237	Mat
238	Amanda, Can you please add a link to Gas Fundy under the Testing tab called "West Cash Trades".
238	The file is called WestCashTrades.htm.
238	The description is, "Daily cash trade volumes by counterparty for West region locations."
238	Thanks.
238	Mat
239	thanks.
240	The balance of month Gas Daily product is called Kern Opal, but all basis and indexes are settled on the NWPL Rocky Mountains product.
240	These should be used for the plasma screen accordingly.
240	Mat
241	David, You may have fixed this already, but please make sure that we filter for the "Y" for "Approved" in our current query that posts to the the GasFundy Site.
241	Thanks.
241	Mat
242	Keith, As requested..................
242	Mat
243	David, I spot checked about 15-20 points and the data looks good.
243	As I indicated before, can we run the query for 2001 as well...preferably using the quick method.
243	Thanks.
243	Mat
244	Amanda, Under the Power table in the Plant Outages folder on the fundy website, we have a link for California ISO outages.
244	Please change the link to point to the file called "pge_ISO_Outages.htm" in the testing folder instead of the existing file.
244	Thanks.
244	Mat
245	Keith, This file contains data for Jan-1-2000 through Dec-31-2001.
245	Mat
246	Chris, Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc. Background The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.
246	These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.
246	In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.
246	As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.
246	Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.
246	Task Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.
246	It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.
246	However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.
246	One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.
246	Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.
246	Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).
246	Timeline This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.
246	At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.
246	Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.
246	Mat
247	Amanda, Please add a new link under the the Power tab in the Plant Outages folder called WSCC Interactive (Portland).
247	The file is in the California directory within the Power directory.
247	It is called pge_Portland_data.htm.
247	Thanks.
247	Mat
248	Chris, For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).
248	These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.
248	Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.
248	For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.
248	We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.
248	I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.
248	For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.
248	Mat
249	As I was discussing with Duncan, I'm coming home Wednesday night and coming back to Houston on Monday late afternoon.
249	During some portion of the holiday, I'll be up at the islands, but i'm free to hang out for a day or so.
249	Are you around Thursday?
249	Where would you go rafting anyway?
249	I'm definitely looking forward to the holiday, though.
249	A little barbaque, a little beer, a little boating, a little fishing, a little beer, a little golfing...I guess I should have taken the whole week off.
249	Anyway, give me a call sometime, and I'll try you when I get chance.
249	Talk to you soon.
249	Mateo
250	Jerry, I requested some questar flow historicals from you per the following email.
250	I am still in need of the referenced data, and would appreciate an indication of when it will be provided.
250	If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at the number below.
250	Thank you.
250	Mathew Smith
251	The following are action items for the historical sheets I checked, including those assigned to Catalina: Socal - Replace data for April 26th, insert data for Dec 16th, 17th 1998.
251	PGE - Load line pack (if available) historicals, complete changes identified in email to Chris H., add/load storage balances.
251	Questar - Replace historicals from 12-9-00 to 2-6-01.
251	El Paso - Reload...
251	KN - No action items.
251	San Juan Plants - No action items.
251	Fix calculation of null values.
251	Mat
252	Tara, It looks to me like the following dates are missing for CIG/WIC Date ranges are inclusive.
252	Mat
253	Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.
253	They couldn't give me a time, though.
253	I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.
253	Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know, is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.
253	A round costs at least $100, but free for me.
253	I better get to the range tomorrow.
253	Unfortunately every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so i'm really in trouble.
253	Oh well.....
253	Talk to you soon.
253	Mat
254	Charles, The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.
254	As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.
254	Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.
254	Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.
254	SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.
254	In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.
254	You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).
254	Anyway, that's all I have.
254	Mat
255	One more thing, we have no way of knowing what gas was bought at index vs. daily.
256	sick of emails yet.............the last line in the table is not SWG, please ignore.
257	Tara, It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).
257	So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.
257	Mat
258	hey, haven't read this yet, will try today.
259	Juan Carlos, The line you deleted simply saves the current record.
259	Deleting it will not cause any problems in a read-only database.
259	In the regular working version, deleting may result in edits to a record not being saved.
259	Mat PS.
259	I hope things are well on the island.
259	Please pass along my regards to everyone.
260	Chris, I recently found out that Questar posts a Clay Basin storage inventory in html on their website.
260	The link is We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the "Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas" and "Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory".
260	This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.
260	Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.
260	We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.
260	Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.
260	Please let me know if you have any questions.
260	Mat
261	When: Tuesday, May 15, 2001 11:00 AM-11:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
261	Where: IT/STP area
262	I do not know what this is in reqard to.
262	Could you have meant to send it to another Mat Smith?
263	Lori, Can you please give me an estimate of when you can provide the requested historical flows we discussed yesterday.
263	I'm trying to manage a number of tasks that depend on this data,.
263	and it would be helpful to know when it might be available.
263	Thank you.
263	Mathew Smith Enron
264	No thanks.
265	This one is fixed.
266	I'll be home Wednesday night and I fly out Monday afternoon, but I don't really know which days I'll be up at the 1000 islands.
266	Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.
266	Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?
266	Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.
266	Jeff will be around in case you didn't know.
266	Anyway, I'll be in touch.
266	Mateo
267	Hey, by the way, do use Instant messenger?
267	I think you should.
267	It would be a great, since I would know when you're on the computer.
267	My ID is MathewSmith18.
268	Chris, I'm not familiar with the details of the reporting requirements for pipelines under the current regs.
268	Can I get an interpretation of Questar's reponse to my request for historicals?
268	Thanks.
268	Mat
269	Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.
269	Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required: Enter Enter Enter Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.
269	And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.
269	Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.
269	Thanks.
269	Mat
270	um, I don't really know.
270	I did a search for "VB6" and did find one file.
270	When you get a chance, can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look.
270	Thanks.
270	Mat
271	Thanks Chris.
271	According to Patti, Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up.
271	When, the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days.
271	Mat
272	Amanda, Please move the link for the West Ops reports from Testing to Pipeline\West and also add an additional link under Desk\West.
272	The location of the actual files should remain unchanged.
272	Thanks.
272	Mat
273	Steve, Exchange wouldn't send the email because the file was too big.
273	I put it in the Dropbox, though.
273	The file is called West Region map.ppt.
273	Please let me know if you need anything else.
273	Mat
274	Karen, My current rotation information is as follows: Current Rotation: Gas Fundamentals Supervisor Name: Chris Gaskill Thanks.
274	Mat.
275	Chris, The attached file contains Kern data for 4th cycle 19th through the 21st and cycle 2 for the 21st.
275	Thanks.
275	Mat
276	try this.
277	Becky, I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.
277	As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.
277	I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.
277	In my absence, Tara Piazze Mat
278	Exactly.
278	Her extension is 3-5276.
278	Thanks.
278	Mat
279	Karen, I was out last week.
279	Do you still need any help?
279	Mat
280	Sure thing.
281	Angela, Please delete all data for PGT (pipeline 15) with effective date less than 12/1/00, and then load the attached file with historicals with effective dates from 1996 through November 30, 2000.
281	Please let me know if you have any problems.
281	Thanks.
281	Mat
282	I need to have an Outlook public calendar folder created to track maintenance shedules on West Region pipelines for the West Gas Trading Desk.
282	Patti Sullivan (psulliv) and I (msmith18) would need administrative rights.
282	Can you please direct me to the appropriate people to have this set up.
282	I can be reached at 3-0472.
282	Thanks.
282	Matt Smith
283	Angela, Here's another file I need loaded ASAP.
283	Please let me know if there are any problems.
283	Thanks.
283	Mat
284	Becky, Have you heard anything yet from Questar?
284	Now we also need data for May 24 through June 1st because their site did not report all week.
284	Should I give Lori a call again?
284	Mat
285	Thanks.
286	Phil, How's this for starters...
286	The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.
286	The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.
286	That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.
286	Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.
286	I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.
286	Mat
287	Eddie, We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.
287	The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.
287	Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.
287	We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.
287	Mat
288	Karen, Here you go.....
288	1.
288	Scheduling - West Gas 4.
288	Phillip Allen, Managing Director Mat
289	Chris, Please add the following new point to the database for PGT (#15) and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others: Name: Klamath Cogeneration - PacifiCorp This is a scraped point currently being posted.
289	This DRN is the same as the IHS DRN for this point.
289	Thanks.
289	Mat
290	Becky, Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.
290	I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.
290	Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.
290	Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.
290	I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.
290	If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.
290	Thanks.
290	Mat
291	As requested....
292	Chris, Can you please change the utilized capacity value for DRN 38725, pipeline 42, effective date 5/7/01 to 2957.
292	Thanks.
292	Mat
293	i'm a dirty boy, a dirty, dirty boy
294	I'll also drop off a copy of the population weighting.
294	Mat
295	Ina, A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.
295	You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.
295	Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.
295	Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.
295	Thanks.
295	Mat
296	For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.
296	I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.
296	It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.
296	I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.
296	Can you please look into this.
296	Thanks.
296	Mat
297	Are you going to bring me the list of trades with the counterparty names?
298	Lindon, It looks like we need to add 9908 to the list.
298	After that i think we're done.
298	Thanks.
298	Mat
299	Maria, Try these...
299	I'm still working on those other curves.
299	Mat
300	Anne, Hey, do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the Oracle database for west index curves?
300	Mat
301	Maria, Hey, I installed SQL server...I feel like a real professional now.
301	Although, I don't remember exactly which table I'm looking for.
301	I found one that's MOD_Load that looks like it's the one.
301	If it is, where do I find what the Scenario ID field means?
301	By the way, I'm still working on those index curves.
301	Thanks.
301	Mat
302	Anne, Actually, I'm not sure whether I want Gas Daily Index's or Physical Index's...Gas Daily preferably.
302	A list or the file you use would be great.
302	Thanks.
302	Mat
303	NG PRC IF-ELPO/SJ INDEX CIG/RKYMTN INDEX NWPL_ROCKY_M INDEX KERN/RIVER INDEX PGE/TOPOCK INDEX NGI-SOCAL INDEX PGE/CG INDEX IF-ELPO/PERMIAN INDEX Maria, I don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for, but these should give you a start.
303	Let me know which ones, I've left out from your list.
303	Mat
304	Maria, I think that the curve names are the same for index as for basis (which you currently pull), except that you specify the curve type as index instead of basis.
304	I've never looked in the database, so I've never seen the fields.
304	Hope this helps.
304	Mat
305	Maria, This is sumas.
305	Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).
305	Let me know if you need anything else.
305	Mat
306	Dave, Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.
306	Nice work!
306	I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.
306	Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?
306	Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?
306	We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.
306	If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.
306	Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.
306	Mat
307	Dave, Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.
307	Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.
307	Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.
307	Mat
308	FYI, the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages, as well as detail about the plant characteristics, so that you may be able to use some of their code.
309	Chris and Eddie, I noticed that since Sept. 20, cycle 13 from NWPL has not been making it into the database, thus showing errors in our Ops report.
309	The Latest Scrape Information does not current show any errors in capture.
309	Can you please look into this and get back to me.
309	Thanks.
309	Mat
310	copy to desktop and double-click to run.
311	Dave, Hey, can you create a view for me on Portland's database.
311	The SQL code is below.
311	Let me know if you need anything else.
311	Mat FROM dbo.MOD_Load INNER JOIN
312	Come by and I'll show you where it is.
312	Mat
313	Maria, Do you know if you guys have started capturing the RT Final import flows from Oasis yet?
313	Mat
314	Hey Christine, Everythings pretty normal around here.
314	Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the shirts.
314	I think they're great.
314	Mat
315	Ina, I still cannot access Sitara Reports.
315	After you last let me know it was taken care of, I do seem to remember it being accessible.
315	However, it definitely is not working currently.
315	Mat
316	Hey, Nice to hear from you.
316	No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.
316	Just work work work.
316	Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.
316	When is a good time now?
316	I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.
316	By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.
316	Anyway, let's chat sometime...
316	Talk to you soon.
316	Mat
317	Nice.
317	I found grandmom to be very sexy.
318	To Whom This May Concern, I have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order.
318	Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address.
318	In response, I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location.
318	The address should read Manor Way Office, but reference the specified apartment number.
318	Pete and Christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery.
318	If the offices are still considered "residential" you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge, which I understand to be not more than $30.
318	Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
318	713-853-047 (day) Mathew Smith
319	More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is.
320	No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.
320	I think they're saving it up for this weekend.
320	I think we're having a party on Saturday.
320	I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit into, though.....
321	goat?
321	i think that's only true for fraternity pledges.
322	Actually, I don't know the number yet.
322	Cell phone still the best.
322	Sorry, I haven't been available last night.
322	I was out.
322	Anyway, what's the news?
322	Mat
323	Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.
323	And no, it's nothing personally related to me.
323	Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.
323	The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.
323	We move in November 9th.
323	Should be pretty cool.
323	I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.
323	We're going to a martini bar before hand.
323	Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.
323	Must leave soon......
324	my canadian beer of choice is Labatt.
325	Jan, Are you guys still planning on selling gas back?
325	Mat
326	you've got most of them, i guess i probably just need to define the major ones for the high level screen...
327	What's up my brother?
327	Long time no speak.
327	I just got your email from Scotty P (somehow he found me).
327	Anyway, I'd like to give you a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.
327	I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to Houston again for a job with Enron.
327	I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.
327	Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.
327	So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.
327	Any chance that anyone is going?
327	I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.
327	If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....
327	Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.
327	Hope all is well.
327	Mat
328	Chris, Hey, I noticed that we have two Portland lines on our boxes.
328	No one is around right now, but I'm wondering if it works, or if anyone ever uses it.
328	I just got a box, and I have the second line programmed in. If you get a chance, why don't you see if it works on your end.
328	Mat
329	address...
330	I assume this is to reserve the hotel.
330	Thanks.
330	Mat
331	Maria, Since you set my security up for the fundamentals database, I can't access any of the outage tables.
331	Can you make sure that I have access to those tables with my NT id "msmith18".
331	Previously, I would use the "gasintranet" ID and "fundamentals" password.
331	Thanks.
331	Mat
332	nice.
332	texas humor.
333	Aaron, The report you dropped off is a good start.
333	I'm going to regroup some of the points.
333	I'll drop it off when I'm finished.
333	Thanks.
333	Mat
334	can you email me the gzn file.
334	My hard drive was replaced and I lost everything on my desktop.
335	in general, we want all history available.
335	You never know when they're going to remove it.
336	Bart, Until we can get the proper access, just come over when you need the loads and I'll create a file for you.
336	Mat
337	thanks
338	Hey, I think I lost your work number.
338	Can you send me it or give me a call at work.
338	Mat
339	Hey, You better do something about the crappy weather.
339	I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?
339	So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.
339	Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.
339	I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).
339	So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.
339	If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.
339	I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.
339	Let me know if you have any suggestions.
339	Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already!
339	Hope you're staying warm and dry.
339	Mat
340	Ina, Ya, the departure should now be Thursday Oct. 18th.
340	I think the 11:15 am flight will do.
340	Everything else remains the same.
340	Thanks.
340	Mat PS.
340	My frequent flyer # is EG235566
341	Chris, I need to reinstall SQL on my machine.
341	Can you send me the link to the setup file in the IT directory.
341	I can't remember where it is.
341	Thanks.
341	Mat
342	thanks
343	Aaron, this is Mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included.
343	The files includes rates, receipt and delivery points, and live links to an EOL listen sheet.
343	It's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed.
343	Also, we do need an ops sheet modified.
343	Basically, we're trying to develop a net total for Keystone production.
343	More importantly, by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work.
343	This is absolutely critical since we have a Nuke going out on Saturday and a major coal plant down.
343	Let me know if you have any issues.
343	Stop by sometime about the Keystone modification.
343	Mat
344	right now, i'm leaning towards no, but my friend Kristen isn't being very cooperative about getting back to me.
344	thanks for keeping me apprised of the situation.
345	Steve, Do you have part 3 and 4 of this document?
345	The last page we have has figure 6, but it looks like there was supposed to be further sections.
345	Mat
346	thanks.
347	Ina, Thanks for checking into it.
347	Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.
347	If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?
347	Maybe it was used at one time or another, but just got forgotten.
347	Anyway, it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building.
347	Thanks.
347	Mat
348	Bart, Sorry I didn't get back to you right away.
348	Because I had my hard drive switched out last week, I have to reinstall SQL server on my computer.
348	However, because of the latest virus scare, they've taken away my administrator access to my machine.
348	This should all be taken care of this week.
348	Please check back with me, and I should be able to provide you with the load data.
348	Mat
349	Mo, Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.
349	I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.
349	Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.
349	As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat.
349	and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!
349	Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.
349	Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.
349	Hope to see you around soon.
349	Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.
349	Mat
350	business, thanks.
351	get this......he didn't even wake up!
351	He had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how Murphy got out of his room.
352	Joe said he found me in the morning face down on the couch in my clothes with the cat snuggling up with me.
353	i think you have the wrong matt...
354	Hey, I think I like to send an email to every that was at the party.
354	You wouldn't by any chance have a list of email addresses would you?
354	Mat
355	no availability...
356	your number is in my phone...can you call me?
357	not too bad...i was late to work, though.
357	Fortunately...the day is over for me.
357	I'm leaving for the airport shortly.
357	AND, i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed!
357	She said she thought she hit a garbage can, but when she heard from the girl having the party that someone hit my car...she realized it was her.
357	Anyway, she called her insurance and it's all good now.
357	Well, I should get going now...
357	See you soon.
357	Mat PS.
357	Sorry if i woke you last night.
358	socal injected 101,000 yesterday.
358	let me know if you need anything else.
359	Hey, what up?
359	i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.
359	Had a pretty cool time this weekend.
359	Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Columbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt.
359	Hood yesterday.
359	I think its about 11,000 ft high.
359	There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost snowing!
359	Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don't think many people do.
359	The little trip made me think about our ski plans, which we should definitely keep pursueing.
359	I apologize i'm a little out of touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance.
359	So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comfortable hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to earth.
359	She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some common interests there.
359	She's totally not into fancy expensive things...which is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can teach.
359	Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i guess you can't have everything...
359	Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.
359	I have to run.
359	Thanks for the email.
359	Talk to you soon.
359	Mat
360	Bart, Just wanted to let you know that I just had access to the west region forecast data granted for the "gasintranet" ID.
360	When I get back to Houston Friday, we can set up the query for you to use.
360	Mat
361	If you want, you can have Dave Woodstrom do the query for you since he should now have access with that ID.
362	Since i'm logged in to this computer i can get mail, so if the phone doesn't work, just send me a quick email...
362	Hope you're feeling better today, and that bitch doesn't give you any shit!
362	mat
363	Bart, Yes, you should be able to pull the loads.
363	IMPORTANT NOTE: there are several "scenario" runs of the model.
363	You should only use the "New Model" scenario which, I believe, is number 25.
363	Mat
364	actually, i haven't eaten yet.
364	i'll call you in a minute.
364	i'm on a conference call right now.
365	sorry, this is taking a while...
366	Steve, Correction on that last email...WA Water Power (Avista) did submit the 714 form and is included in the PNW total.
366	Mat
367	I'm on the 3 pm flight today.
367	If you wanted to take me, I wouldn't say no, but, as always, don't feel like you have to...
367	Mat
368	hey thanks...i'll be there.
368	just got back from Portland last night and am going through some FPP withdraw....
369	Sheila, Mat
370	Thanks.
370	So, I'm curious to know how the run went Saturday morning.
370	I was thinking about you guys while I was laying in my bed slightly hung over...
371	that's a really old one, but definitely one of my favorites.
372	Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company.
372	Weather was really nice, so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.
372	Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.
372	At least there was plenty of beer.
372	Then we went home and grilled some steaks.
372	I like steak.
372	That's about it.
372	How about you?
372	Did you get all of your laundry done.
372	I didn't.
372	Mat
373	Marlo, The name and number of the person to contact regarding the billing discrepancy for July 2001 is Mary Reid @ 213-244-3898.
373	Gasselect clearly shows only one trade for 43,559 mmbtu's from account 2527 to Z99.
373	Mat
374	Karen, I would be happy to attend lunch on Thursday.
374	Thanks.
374	Mat
375	i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.
375	I hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.
375	i don't think i was that drunk, but who knows.
375	plus, i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing.
375	oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.
375	anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full moon...make sure to look out for the goblins...
376	um, are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted...
377	hey, don't forget that report...Keith's bugging me.
377	thanks.
378	Sounds like a trick question...Obviously, you would take offence to me answering "no" for any reason at all.
378	However, I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason.
378	Though, if I answer "yes", it might imply that I don't like you now because you do not work at Enron, and somehow make you wish you did.
378	So....the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity (as long as it isn't too close), but who i like is regardless of employment.....
379	OK, I changed my mind...the answer is yes.
380	All I can say is that I'm not buying any....
381	I don't recall needing any additional functionality from CQG.
381	In fact, I don't even use CQG.
381	Could you be referring to someone else.
381	Mat
382	told you so...
383	Oh yes, it was a good contest.
383	Gannon is quite the quarterback.
383	Did you?
383	I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and went to bed.
383	Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.
383	It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors.
383	I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.
383	Maybe the government will bail us out.
383	Anwyay, how's everything with you?
384	Keith, Hey, is the plotter working, such that I could get a print out of that WSCC map you made for me a week or two ago.
384	Thanks.
384	Mat
385	you just want my address...2125 Sul Ross, Houston, TX, 77057....
386	well, i only got single prints...so i have to get copies or scan them or something...so it may take a bit..sorry.
386	About the sock, ya I'm short on socks...so it would be great if you sent it, but if not, don't worry about it.
387	Maria, Hey, your database sucks!
387	(j/k) Give me a ring when you get a chance.
387	Mat
388	well...here we are.
388	i'm still not buying.
389	it's a little iffy right now...
389	i'm planning for not having one, although i'll in the one place that the company is trying to preserve.
390	not much i guess.
390	I'm sure you heard the CNBC speel earlier.
390	I have no news other than that.
391	Looks like Dynegy may buy us.
392	nope
393	true...i think the dynegy equity investment is dead...i think the discussion are about a full take over.
394	well, i was just in a meeting for an hour...
395	ug...this day is taking forever...absolutely nothing going on here.
396	Stephanie, Do you have any idea when this will be completed?
396	Let me know if you need any additional information.
396	Thanks.
396	Mat
397	Apparently, Stephanie is out of the office, do you know if someone else can set up the EOL?
397	Mat
398	Thanks so much.
399	Karen, Let me know if you need any additional information to set up my EOL ID.
399	Thanks.
399	Mat
400	Karla, I assume you are referring to my NT ID, which is msmith18.
400	Let me know if you need anything else.
400	Thanks.
400	Mat
401	This is typical of the communication we are getting.
401	I received this at 3:30 pm...
402	i am trading ene like a champ!
402	if only i had size!
403	well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.
403	Too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies.
403	at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.
403	so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it.
403	there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave Enron and join other companies.
403	How's Kate doing?
403	are they worried?
403	there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in Portand.
403	At least there are a bunch of other shops in Houston for people who get screwed from this deal...
404	I received my eol id, and went ahead and executed a few trades.
404	I'm now trying to get into TDS to views positions and such, but it doesn't look like it is set up.
404	I can get into TDS but there aren't any selections in the Desks dropdown box.
404	The tds login i used was msmith_pc.
404	Is this something you set up?
404	Mat
405	Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.
405	Mat
406	Motorcross...white trashyness...sounds like fun.
406	i think i'm going to go home and pass out.
406	i'm so fucking tired.
406	went to the Dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers.
406	only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely.
406	oh well...i hope there's some good tv on.
406	sure wish i had some motorcross to attend!
406	Mat
407	Thanks Kam.
408	It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.
408	I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.
408	Mat
409	Thanks.
410	Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.
410	The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.
410	It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.
410	I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.
410	Thanks.
410	Mat
411	Steve, As I remember the output from your power forecasting model gets stored in the MOD_Load table.
411	However, that table does not appear have results for California for the scenario ID 25 (New Model).
411	Does the California data have a different scenario ID?
411	Mat
412	FYI, Northwest is having that airfare sale again.
412	Houston to White Plains...120 bucks...
413	hey, that airfare between boston and houston of 120 bucks is now available between rochester and houston.
414	Ina, I logged out and Kobra still does not work.
414	Mat
415	thanks.
415	i'm guessing most of those were hitting the aga number....
416	Ina, Just wanted to let you know that noone has come by to setup my Kobra.
416	Mat
417	Shouldn't be a problem.
417	I'll get it done.
418	Chris, The last I left it with Chris and Dave W. was that I was going to compile a list of exactly what data we needed and I will include all the items you indicated.
418	I do have time this week, but not much because it's bid week.
418	Mat
419	Ashley, There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.
419	I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.
419	It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.
419	??
419	Mat
420	Jose, Can you please add Zac McCorroll to the distribution list for the West temperature sheet.
420	Thanks.
420	Mat
421	I think this is all for now...of course, he should have access to all of the items within the West directories below.
421	Thanks.
421	Mat

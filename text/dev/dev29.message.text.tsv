0	Bob, I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.
0	I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.
0	In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.
0	Brian really started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.
0	The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).
0	A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK).
0	As for enemies at Enron---I think that they are all gone (Ken, Amanda, Cliff, John Stokes and crew).
0	I think that Mark Frevert still thinks highly of Brian and understands that Brian was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the Ken and Amanda thing).
0	I do know that Brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very Christian and has a lot less ego than he once had.
0	If I could hire him back, I would.
0	I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.
0	I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.
0	Let me know if I can help further.
0	Dan
1	Pam, I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.
1	Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.
1	I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back.
1	We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.
1	If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop.
1	When can we expect it to be available for viewing.
1	Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
1	Also, What has happened to our move?
1	We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.
1	Dan
2	Dave, I haven't heard anything about Pacer for quite some time.
2	Has there been any progress or have we dropped it?
2	Dan
3	FYI
4	What about our move????
5	We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.
5	With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.
5	So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep.
5	a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts.
5	Thanks Dan
6	Kent, If we do so, I would assume that the reasoning is based as much on pricing as it is on volumetrics.
6	What are Jo and Larry's views on the market at this point?
6	Dan
7	Rod, I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".
7	I just don't know if we'll be ready.
7	I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.
7	Also, Greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.
7	Therefore, I'd like to start getting Tim DeSpain involved.
7	Does that make sense?
7	Dan
8	Rod, I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.
8	I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005. Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."
8	This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock.
8	I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.
8	Dan
9	But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??
10	I noticed that several people were left off of Stan's attempt at an organizational chart.
10	Please forgive the oversight and don't read anything into it, as our organization hasn't changed.
10	Thanks.
10	Dan
11	But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.
11	Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).
11	This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage.
12	Steve, This is landing at a bad time.
12	I'm going to be in Omaha going over the 2002 plan, and doing other business.
12	Unfortunately, I cannot reschedule this one so I'll have to miss the Wine fest.
13	Kim, I would like to look further into getting onto the MOD Board.
13	Any suggestions on what to do?
13	Thanks.
13	Dan
14	Cindy, I will handle and respond to the attached.
14	Dan
15	Eric, I'd suggest: Janet Place--Legal Mary Kay Miller--regulatory Technical--???
15	talk with Phil Sound O.K.?
15	Dan
16	Stan, I just glanced at your new org.
16	chart and thought I'd make a comment (or really more of an observation).
16	Jesus had 12 direct reports and screwed up on one of them, so while I agree that a flat organisation is best, I think that you'd better be very careful or you get a godlike ego.
16	Dan
17	Cindy, No. I'll give her mine and Eric's.
17	I fear that if she has Stan's, he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level, and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority.
17	Dan
18	Larry, At what point do we consider taking off the '02 hedges?
18	Is that a game we should play or not?
18	What is your view of market for '01 and '02?
18	Dan
19	Stan, Last week we coordinated with Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro, Joe Hartsoe and the Washington office, so that they would make sure that our objections (as outlined in Dennis's communication below ) to certain portions of Bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard.
19	They've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the Bingaman hearings.
19	Williams, El Paso and Duke have all done the same.
19	Dan
20	Cindy, No. This are working meetings which kick off the due diligence review for each of the withdrawn partners.
20	So, everyone will be sending their worker bees only.
20	Dan
21	Stan, Take a quick glance at this.
21	Dan
22	Stan, The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x EBITDA with a valuation more in the range of $180m.
22	While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.
22	They have yet to respond.
22	In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.
22	Dan
23	Eric, Julie has asked to take vacation on Friday, so we'll need Susan to cover phones, faxes, and general office business on Friday until 6:00 Eastern/ 5:00 Central.
23	Based on our efforts in Washington this week, Friday could be a very busy day.
23	Dan
24	Pat, Thanks.
24	I appreciate the input.
24	Let me know if anything pertaining to the specific routing of the line begins to bubble up.
24	Dan
25	Greg, I have no interest for ETS.
25	Dan
26	Kim and John, I agree with Kim's second point.
26	I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.
26	I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.
26	Can we clean this language up a little?
26	Dan
27	Kim and John, I assumed that we'd moved away from that point in favor of the right to match.
27	Is that not the case?
27	Dan
28	Stan, The teleconference today (with TCPL) held nothing really new.
28	We did agree not to bring in any other third parties, such as El Paso, at this time.
28	TCPL noted that they would be interested in a roles as the developer (and perhaps as the operator or some or all of the new line), and would also expect to be responsible for all Canadian legal and regulatory matters.
28	They acknowledged that we have more expertise in the areas of US rates and regulatory and legal, finance, commercial and marketing activities and would expect that we take the lead there.
28	We are working toward a first cut on a JV structure over the next two weeks.
28	Dan
29	No interest.
30	Shelley, I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.
30	I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.
30	After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?
30	Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.
30	Thanks.
30	Dan
31	Shelley, I was thinking just revenue, but we can just as easily do O&M, too.
31	Which would you prefer?
31	Dan
32	Dennis, I'm fine with the letter.
32	And, I think that it should be well received.
32	Dan
33	Yes
34	We wouldn't.
34	I'll talk with Kim.
35	Eric, I'll be talking with John sometime this afternoon.
35	Dan
36	Thanks
37	Eric, FYI, I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once.
37	I called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call.
37	I called again today and received no return call.
37	You may have a good relationship with these guys, but I think that John may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity.
37	I'll try one more time, then I'll call it quits.
37	Dan
38	Rod, This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.
38	Also, Kent's numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed.
38	The other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.
38	We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies).
38	Are you okay with that?
38	I am.
38	Dan
39	Martha, Would you drop me a quick note and update me on your progress?
39	Is there anything that you need to be doing at this point?
39	Also give me your general feel for the market's receptiveness to date, the caliber of Luminent's staff, and how the relationship is going so far.
39	If you have some available time next week, call Julie and get on my calendar.
39	Thanks.
39	Dan
40	Janet, I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.
40	He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.
40	He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.
40	He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.
40	Dan
41	Janet, Yes, he will be returning as an Associate.
41	I don't think that Billy is coordinating this trip, but I'll check.
41	Dan
42	Mark, I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.
42	As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.
42	As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.
42	I know a lot of people have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.
42	So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.
42	Thanks.
42	Dan
43	Mark, Would you send me a copy of your announcement?
43	Thanks.
43	Dan
44	It's up to you now.
45	Steve, I'd like to get one of the blackberry wireless handhelds.
45	How can I get one?
45	Dan
46	Eric, Should I call Dennis, will he call me, or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize?
46	Dan
47	Eric, I thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the Withdrawn Partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old Partnership, by a simple modification to Paragraph 1.
47	I think it's still pretty fuzzy, don't you?
47	What was wrong with Duke's proposed changes?
47	Dan
48	Mary Kay, The decision couldn't have been better if we had written it ourselves---another BIG success to add to your 2001 list.
48	Dan
49	Drew and Steve, Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well??
49	Dan
50	John, Stan Babiuk of El Paso called again to express their interest in buying Sunniland.
50	How sure are you that this deal will happen?
50	Dan
51	Brian, Do we have the funds for this?
51	If so I'd like to proceed on this one.
51	What capacity do we have for PAA's for the rest of 2002?
51	Dan
52	Brian, If that is the case, I think that I have $0 left.
52	There was a request earlier this week for $750 from NNG.
52	I guess we'll have to put this on hold for now.
52	I'll get back with Steve Harris.
52	Dan
53	Since to bulk of these will be used for employees, I'd like to try and get 20-plus tickets through Deb---not hospitality ones.
54	Mary Kay, It seems that others have benefited handsomely from the volatility in Permian/SanJuan to Cal.
54	border prices.
54	Interesting, isn't it?
54	Dan
55	Pam, Forget the monitor and video cart, I had Julie order them off iBuyit today.
55	Who should we call to test the CATV cable that was installed, as it appears not to work, and who do we call to remove the 36" TV and entertainment center that was delivered to us last week? Thanks. Dan
56	Mary Kay, Just a bit of a heads up--It is looking like the Management Conference in November is being cancelled (probably to be rescheduled for after the first of the year).
56	We should hear something official in the next day or two.
56	Dan
57	SOOOO--Is it really too late to consider a disaster recovery site that would be safer than Ardmore in the event of flood, bio-terrorism, or other crazy attack, that would be marketable to other companies??
57	I think that this a question that one should ask one's self if one was just promoted to a lofty position of authority.
57	Dan
58	I love you.
58	Cool is it not.
59	I got it, pal.
60	John, I've been holding Babiuk off.
60	But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.
60	Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?
60	It would show that he's, at least, serious.
60	Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.
60	What do you think?
60	Dan
61	John, That is fine, but I'd also like to see current month to Plan as well, as this will be of particular interest next year.
61	Dan
62	Mary Kay, I still haven't forgotten--I'm talking with Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon, and I'll let you know.
62	Dan
63	Mary Kay, I still haven't forgotten about you--I'll be talking to Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon.
63	I'll give you a call then.
63	Dan
64	Okay
65	Eric, Bob will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.
65	It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that Bob does have direct access to Stan and me.
65	This is consistent with what Bill had originally talked to Bob about.
65	Okay?
65	Dan
66	Are you there?
67	Message received.
67	Thanks.
68	Shelley, How are your people coming on the TW and NNG contracts?
68	Sorry about the short notice, but as usual, it's good that it's in our hands and not someone else's.
68	Dan
69	Eric, Here is the IT Backhaul proposal that went to Gonzales.
69	You'll note that it is for deliveries west of the Florida border.
69	Dan
70	Eric, I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons.
70	She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.
70	I had phones shifted over to Audrey after I got a call from Cindy looking to find Julie or me.
70	If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.
70	Dan
71	Eric, Considering the number of fires we have at Enron right now this is about the last thing on Stan's mind.
71	Hill and Hartsoe are appropriate to be attending this meeting.
71	Again--I think that this is a bit more of Dennis' overkill.
71	Do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades?
71	Dan
72	John, Have Craig give me a call--we have alot of new work being done with PG&E and TW, so he could be quite helpful.
72	Dan
73	Stan, I have it on good authority that Dynegy is making a run at Bob Hayes.
73	My guess is that Bob will call you or me to discuss his status sometime today.
73	Dan
74	John, I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.
74	All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.
74	Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.
74	Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.
74	Dan
75	Not yet.
76	I just got off of fifty and there is no news yet.
76	Last we heard, Chevron's CEO had one more call to make with someone from Texaco, and that their response was eminent.
76	Dan
77	We'll have $1.5 B. for about 15 minutes.
78	Fran, I've already talked with Bob about the specifics of this, so go ahead and forward it to him (he's expecting it).
78	Dan
79	Rod, I had approved an offsite Happy Hour for our Market Services Group following our string of emergencies (about a $2500-$3000 expenditure).
79	Considering everything that has happened, we're reviewing all costs, whether previously approved or not, and cutting where we can.
79	This is one that I don't think I should pull unless you feel strongly that I should.
79	Let me know your thoughts.
79	Dan
80	Julie, All I really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could, since the employees would take as many as we could get.
80	I was concerned that with all of the cost cutting, someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets.
80	I thought that Deb could get eight (8), I'd buy them personally, and I'd use four (Hayes and me), and would give the other four to employees.
80	If Mary Kay wants four (4), that's fine.
80	Let Deb know, however, that employees using them for personal use (which I'm sure will be all of them), will be expected to pay for them themselves.
80	Dan
81	Julie, Deb refers to "bowl tickets".
81	I assume that she means "playoff tickets", since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the BCS Bowls (which is after the playoffs in Dallas).
81	Dan
82	Mary Kay, At what point can we expect the CPUC and IS's to take their lumps and get on with picking at some other issues?
82	Hasn't Kern River done something that they can spend their time fighting about?
82	How do you think this one will go from here?
82	Dan
83	FYI---I guess it ain't over 'till it's over.
84	Cindy, For what it's worth, I am quite opposed to going forward with the Enron Christmas Party as planned.
84	With as much negative press as we've gotten, we are assured that the local TV stations and the Chronicle will cover it, and will put the "lavish" affair in the worst light possible.
84	Can't we stop it now??
84	Dan
85	FYI
86	Bob, Would you copy me when you send the first draft, I'd like to get a better feel for it.
86	Thanks.
86	Dan
87	Phil, Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).
87	Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.
87	Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?
87	Let me know.
87	Dan
88	Stan, Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that "most of Enron's critical employees are under contract" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.
88	He also made a comment that bonuses were "scheduled to be paid in mid-February" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).
88	I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.
88	I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.
88	And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness.
88	Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?
88	Dan
89	Cindy, This was the official response on whether the Enron Field Christmas Party would be cancelled.
89	Let Stan know as well.
89	Dan
90	Stan, In response to your questions today: 1.
90	Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (Sean Bolks being the lead).
90	As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.
90	2.
90	Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (Pat Shortridge).
90	Other than that, they provide no value.
90	3.
90	Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.
90	4.
90	Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.
90	We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.
90	Dan
91	Joel, I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.
91	Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.
91	I know that Duke is still hiring, too.
91	The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.
91	You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.
91	In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.
91	I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.
91	Take care.
91	Dan
92	Mike and Dave, As you probably guessed, Stan and I will not be coming to the Christmas Party after all.
92	I will try to get to Omaha prior to the Party for a couple of days though.
92	Dan
93	Kent, I understand your concern, but at this point, I may have to tell you who the "right" person is for the time being.
93	I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.
93	Whatever is done, I can assure you that your "right" choice to fill any position will be from within our group, and will make sense from an overall ETS Commercial perspective.
93	Dan
94	FYI--this should wind Kent up just a bit.
95	Matthew, Here are mine: The Woodlands, TX 77380 281-362-1112 (home) 832-444-8257 (cell) Take Care!!
95	Dan
96	Drew, The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.
96	Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.
96	Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.
96	Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.
96	Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?
96	If not, we could have a big hole for next year.
96	Dan
97	John, Just one suggestion.
97	I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.
97	In the first paragraph, final sentence, could we change it to read "These actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults, and to preserve the value in our core energy business".
97	Dan
98	Greg, I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.
98	He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.
98	This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.
98	Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay.
98	Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.
98	Dan
99	Stan, As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.
99	Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.
99	Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.
99	As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being.
99	If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.
99	I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value.
99	Let me know your thoughts on this one.
99	Dan
100	Richard, Thanks for checking in. We are doing fine.
100	In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.
100	I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.
100	None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.
100	Judy and the kids are doing fine.
100	We do see London alumni on a regular basis.
100	Are you going to be here over the holidays?
100	We'd love to see you guys.
100	Let me know what your calendar looks like.
100	Dan
101	No, and I'd like to know who in my group is using it for 135.31/mo.
101	Can they tell me that?
101	Dan
102	All, As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.
102	Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.
102	Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.
102	Upon completion, please forward it to me.
102	Dan
103	Brian, I didn't hear back on the PPA for Julie Armstrong.
103	Is it scheduled to be paid?
103	Dan
104	See if you can figure out how to get into this??
104	Dan
105	Stan, Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.
105	Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.
105	We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and Lorraine would sell for incremental revenue.
105	If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.
105	Agreed?
105	Dan
106	Guys, We need to terminate this (unilaterally if possible, or if not, bilaterally) and move towards settlement now (it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which I believe will be on Monday).
106	Who is not being responsive?
106	I'll track them down and get an answer if I have to.
106	I think that we're too late for today, so let's do it in the morning.
106	Dan
107	Rod, I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap.
107	I'll let you know when I have them.
107	Dan
108	Ken, I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.
108	Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?
108	We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.
108	Are you going to do anything about it?
108	I think that a lot of people would like to know.
108	Dan
109	Eric, Do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in?
109	Dan
110	Cindy, Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).
110	If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.
110	Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.
110	Thanks.
110	If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.
110	Dan
111	Dave, FYI.
111	I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination.
111	Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything.
111	How can we get these answers?
111	Dan
112	Jared, Starting when?
112	Dan
113	Rod, Michelle Lokey has 269,000 coming in from WMB as an OBA settlement today or tomorrow into the New account.
113	I doubt that it is forecasted.
113	I'll just have her call Tracy.
113	Dan
114	Rod, FYI---Let's discuss.
115	Rick, I thought that there was $553,000 due from ENA for November capacity release.
115	Who are the original shippers on the other $348,000?
115	Dan
116	Rick, I guess that we are going to be s.o.l.
116	as an unsecured creditor on the $129,000.
116	How do we get to the $226,350 where they acted as agent.
116	Can we go direct to the beneficiaries?
116	Whatever can be done needs to be done fast, because people, money and paperwork seem to be disappearing around ENA's shop.
116	Dan
117	Guys, Fran Fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 2001 and a worksheet for 2002 merit increases.
117	Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.
117	Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to Fran Fagan by December 28.
117	As guidelines: 1.
117	We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.
117	2.
117	Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, Stan, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.
117	3.
117	I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.
118	Fran, If Julie's merit needs to be lump sum, just move it over to that column.
118	Also, send me Eric Gadd's sheets as well.
118	Thanks.
118	Dan
119	Steve, It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance.
119	I have an extra $24,500 that you can have now.
119	Use it if you need to.
119	Dan
120	Rod, I've had this removed from numerous users so far due to the cost.
120	We'll have this down to three or four users in the next week or so.
120	Dan
121	Guys, Several of our people have PROFITEX installed on their computers at a monthly rate of $135/mo S. Harris, K. Miller, S. Neville, R. Cabrera, R. Preston, R. Paladino, J. Prichard, L. Pavlou).
121	If it is not necessary for the performance of their jobs, have the service terminated for the respective user.
121	Thanks.
121	Dan

0	So do you think things are proceeding well ?
1	My guys tell me we are just about finished on our end and will be getting ready to beta test.
1	How are your folks doing ?
2	I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough.
2	We will not support the app.
2	It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information.
2	As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project.
2	I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.
2	Comments ?
3	Let's let Govt.
3	Affairs get some more info before doing anything.
4	Stranger than fiction....
5	let's discuss.
6	Talk to Matt Motsinger for that information.
6	He is in charge of the reporting for that.
7	If we accept, then yes our IPE shares get converted to ICE shares.
8	yadda yadda yadda....
9	the c1 guy's note is just more e-commerce blather...I don't know whether he would add any value or not, but would definitely add buzzwords.
10	Thank you for the note.
10	We are evaluating the potential value that Techspan could bring to Enron.
10	We will contact you when are ready to enter into a dialogue.
10	Once again thank you for your interest in Enron.
10	Andy Zipper Vice President
11	Okay, but you're still sleeping on the couch tonight....
12	Please see revised market assignments.
12	Addititions are highlighted in blue.
13	no interest.
13	thanks.
14	I don't know.
15	I need to meet with GM from 12:30 to 2:00, so the early offsite slot works for me.
15	Thanks.
16	Can you schedule and send out the following note to the EnronOnline origination group: "Please attend an origination meeting on Tuesday, May 29 from 8:30 to 10:00. The focus of this meeting will doing a walkthrough of an EnronOnline demo for both EnronOnline hosted products and X-online hosted environments. This demo will cover all relevant functionality of the system, similar to what we have been presenting to GM et al."
16	Send to: Dave Forster Michael Bridges Bob Shults Dan Diamond Jake Staffel John Allario John Pavetto Mike Haney Leonardo Pacheco Carl Carter cc:Greg Piper, Mark Palmer
17	Okay.
17	It wil be Bob Shults.
17	I will put him in contact with Joe.
18	Please call Joe Robertson of enron Metals in NY to discuss market-making deal with the COMEX.
19	this is the underlying deal.
19	it needs work and i am not sure we would do it.
19	also, no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals.
20	I AGREE WITH KAL.
21	I believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position.
21	We do not see anything changing.
21	The deal remains terminated for the reasons below.
22	I declined to review Drew because I feel I haven't really spent a lot of time with him.
22	The times I have worked with him, he has done a great job and been easy to work with.
23	Let me make this clear: Accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with EnronOnline.
23	We ahve too much at stake right now.
23	Thanks
24	Yes, and I would you and I to chime in as well.
25	Vin, Glad we could hook up yesterday.
25	The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders.
25	I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals.
25	EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants.
25	Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master.
25	We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron.
25	I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step.
25	Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.
25	Thanks, Andy Zipper Vice President Enron Corp.
26	Please review the spreadsheet, and look at Daily Deals Graph.
27	Justin, The traders are free to use any platform they like.
27	I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision.
27	It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.
27	Thanks, Andy
28	Lara, You need to be the master user for the platform.
28	It is EWS policy.
28	Go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with Justin.
29	Guys, Let's get together today to dicuss demo.
29	I would like to demo full capability, including option manager.
29	I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only.
29	No need to convert to dollar ox just yet.
29	Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.
29	I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00 Andy
30	thanks.
30	damned things never work.
31	millionth trade: eric graff @ Coral, TCO pool day gas, someone on scott neal's desk.
32	OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems.
32	We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus.
32	It is strongest in front office risk management.
32	I would view their competition as KioDex.
32	The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.
33	Frank, Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system.
33	We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement.
33	Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.
33	Andy Zipper
34	Mike, That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence.
34	If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go.
34	Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.
34	Thanks, Andy Zipper
35	We will do on Monday morning, but I don't think we need Jay involved.
36	Kal will be finishing mine shortly.
36	Please be prepared to do the 3 hole punch thing 20 times.
36	Thanks.
37	Okay, fair enough.
37	He would be perfect for the role, but I understand what you are trying to accomplish.
38	what about London ?
39	It's fine with me.
40	CAN YOU SEND David Lebow in IR a copy of the above report on electronic commmodity trading.
40	thanks.
41	Let me if you receive this email.
42	good !
43	I'll attend briefly, but you can run it.
44	We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement.
44	If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement.
45	same plan
46	cool go for it.
47	close enough for 5 9's, no ?
48	no interest.
49	I know Steve Murray quite well.
50	Add Barrick Gold to your list.
50	They like Enron, and Bruce Garner has had extensive discussions with them.
51	what would be the product the Sabre would list ?
51	I like the name but can't see the business idea; help me out.
52	where are we at with them ?
53	Please work with the group so that I am no longer inundated with erequests for additional mailbox space.
54	how does this relate to what we are working on with them ?
55	When will we have a draft available fo distribution to Accenture ?
56	Unfortunately I will not be attending, but I would like to participate via videocon.
57	This is my simplistic first take:
58	Bloomberg has come back to the table with us and are being good boys so far.
58	So I don't have a problem issuing them a EnronOnline journalist ID to view your prices.
58	Thanks for the cooperation.
58	Andy
59	1).
59	Hickerson does not have any products up yet.
59	I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill.
59	He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.
59	2).
59	To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian.
59	I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this.
59	I will find out.
59	3).
59	I think it is 50/50 on GM.
59	They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish.
59	They do want to make markets.
59	I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating.
59	Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.
59	4).
59	I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.
59	5).
59	I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL.
59	This should not be viewed as a commission.
59	6).
59	I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals.
59	He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.
59	7).
59	Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.
59	8).
59	As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API.
59	We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).
60	I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.
60	I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that.
60	and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.
60	A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
60	$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction.
60	So total value not including per transaction is $350K.
60	I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details.
60	It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.
60	I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard.
60	Patience.
60	Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.
60	I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix.
60	It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.
61	Congratulations !
61	Now let's focus on closing the deal and getting someone else signed up.
61	Well done all.
62	huh ?
63	1).
63	Reuters will give us 75% of all subscription revenue, which is how the product is sold.
63	This is on a monthly or yearly basis.
63	phone: 281-437-3307 pager: 713-833-0736 good luck.
64	Let's you and I get together for lunch today, and do the same with Brad tomorrow.
65	I will be participating by videocon.
66	This is where we are with banks for fx product hosting on EOL.
67	please put greg piper, phillipe bibi, and greg whalley on distribtuion list.
67	Thanks
68	I have had you added to distribution list.
69	Sounds kind of vague to me.
69	I think we should stick to known publications who we think add value.
70	In case you guys didn't have a copy.
71	done.
72	have we heard back ?
73	Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are.
73	I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail.
73	I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...
73	A big Mazel Tov on the engagement !
73	Married life is the way to go.
73	I heard about Sonny.
73	Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.
73	I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.
73	Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994
74	This looks fine.
74	Please distribute to Accenture.
74	Thanks,
75	open up attached word doc.
75	that should cover it.
75	thanks.
76	would you like me to fill it out and return it to you ?
77	sorry for the delay I will have my check tomorrow.
78	John, We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.
78	We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes.
78	It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice.
78	We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.
78	Revenue expectations: Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop.
78	They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.
78	With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.
78	This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace.
78	In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.
78	If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.
79	Can I get a Reuters screen as well ?
80	I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.
80	1).
80	We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment.
80	They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site.
80	He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it.
80	Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.
80	2).
80	He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model.
80	They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.
80	3).
80	Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2).
80	his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks.
80	In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.
80	4).
80	When I expressed some skepticism about 3).
80	he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services.
80	I told him we would.
80	If anyone has any questions about this let me know.
81	please...
82	Next steps are he gets me a contract for the API, and lets me know when they are meeting on mid and back.
83	Let's table this for now.
83	Too much going on.
83	On another note: Where do we stand with TFS ?
84	Heard you had ended up at Allegheny.
84	In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?
84	Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.
84	Hope all is well.
84	Andy
85	The propoer contact at Enron for you is Jay Webb.
85	He can be reached at jay.webb@enron.com.
85	I will foward this to him.
85	Good Luck, Andy Zipper
86	Over to you.
87	I need this deal closed by month end.
88	why are we bothering with LOC, I thought we had moved past that ?
89	Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ?
89	This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ?
90	Not enough of a background in finance.
90	Thanks and keep trying.
91	Stewart, It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations.
91	These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core.
91	I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.
91	Andy Zipper Enron Networks
92	Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms !
92	Here comes Allison !
92	On another note we went live with TQ yesterday.
92	Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec.
92	the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ.
92	Pretty lame.
92	On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades.
92	46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.
92	Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards.
92	They would buy a block of desktops to cover it.
92	Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea.
92	He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC.
92	My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing.
92	What are your thoughts ?
92	Hope all is well Andy
93	Please check with me prior to traveling to conferences.
93	Thanks
94	my work phone is 713 853 6994
95	I think this guy would be a good fit for RAC.
95	Send the resume to them.
96	FYI
97	I've asked Bob to be the business side representative to work with Operations and IT in getting the Kiodex project off the ground.
97	In addition he will be pursuing the channel partner opportunities with them regarding Product and Environment hosting services.
97	On the sales channnel effort he will work closely with Dave Forster.
98	looks good.
98	what are vector's major receipt and delivery points ?
99	Claudio, I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused.
99	I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather.
99	I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather.
99	One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point.
99	What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?
99	Thanks Andy
100	jeff said he does not have access to trade emissions allowances.
100	if he indeed does not, please turn him on for those.
100	if he does, let me know.
100	thanks.
101	I understand; however my request stands.
101	I would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this, it is the same I ask of all my direct reports.
101	Thanks
102	John, On the first note: OK, thanks.
102	On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills.
102	You guys need to figure it out, with my help.
102	Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that.
102	This is one.
102	Your cooperation is appreciated.
102	Thanks,
103	I realize that traveling to see a client is part of our job.
103	I would just ask that we try to spend those expense dollars as efficiently and conscientiously as possible.
103	Thanks,
104	Mike's thoughts on subject...
105	What is, exactly, the state of play here ?
105	I nothing else happens, on Monday does the product go up on the wallboard ?
105	Has Eddie quoted on px to the Merc ?
105	I need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between Whalley ,Arnold and Lavorato.
106	Thanks, are we talking to GreatLakes pipepline as well ?
107	do we have a contract in front of them yet ?
108	Harry's comments.
108	He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.
109	Greg and Philippe Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline: 1).
109	The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions.
109	The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year.
109	The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.
109	2).
109	The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time.
109	Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal.
109	We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.
109	Recommendation: EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin.
109	DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it.
109	While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform.
109	This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned.
109	There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it.
109	It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN.
109	As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.
109	Thanks,
110	Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench.
110	If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.
111	I talked with Greg and he and bibi are for it.
111	Start the process with Guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the DealBench folks.
112	thanks.
113	Wasn't me.
114	Do we want to make this official ?
115	Give Raj a call.
116	I do not want my name in the article.
116	Please use Greg Piper's or Phillipe Bibi's.
116	Thanks
117	Thanks for the note.
117	Awaiting your review and response.
117	Andy Zipper
118	Kenny, Peggy, Mike, We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June.
118	We can move as fast as you need us to.
118	Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences.
118	How does this work for you guys ?
118	Thanks
119	My pleasure.
120	Claudio, I agree with you.
120	The first bullet point will be easier to implement.
120	Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want.
120	My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points.
120	I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it.
120	Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.
120	questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate.
120	What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.
120	Regards, Andy
121	You're right he does look good.
121	I am very interested.
121	Can you set up a phone interview, and if that goes well bring him down for rounds.
122	When you get a chance can you gice me a call re: the above and Natsource.
122	I'm around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me.
122	Thanks Andy
123	thanks.
124	I agree.
124	The whole thing is a sham.
125	FYI
126	any help you can give us would be appreciated.
126	thanks.
127	Thank you.
128	Stewart, I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations.
128	When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? " The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell.
128	There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc...
128	What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.
128	For what it is worth.
128	Andy
129	I agree completely.
129	We are the delivery vehicle for Kiodex.
130	In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler.
130	``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said.
130	``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

132	Don't know if you saw it, but your friend and mine Paul Addis is leaving AEP to "pursue other interests".
133	I think it relates to Paul not getting the top job in their soon to be spun off unregulated unit.
133	That job went to some guy named Shockley who Eric Vanderwald will report to.
133	Their press release makes for fun reading.
134	sure.

138	all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.
138	Let me know if you have questions.

168	Month Vol Steve, be advised we had a BIG rally today in Jan Feb Mar vols, almost 3 %.
169	Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome.
169	"Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour.
169	"And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria."
169	Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

170	PIRA today issued bullish comments.
170	don't know whee we go from here.
170	Vol got bid up in winter huge today.
171	Small issue but annoying: If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated.
171	i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.
171	Hope all is well otherwise, Andy
172	I don't know, but I will go.
173	The Astro's are just plain awful in the post season.
173	They hit hit hit in the regular tand then crawl into their holes in Sept. Look for Larry Dirker to be canned pretty quickly.

The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Osama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions. "Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment.
187	What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry?
187	Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar.
187	Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows.

193	After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions.
193	On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising.
193	This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.
193	Just thought you would like to know.
194	to be honest this looks a little to convoluted to me.

196	Lots of good stories.

200	I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds.
200	Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience.
200	The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late.
200	I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530.
200	Keep flying.
201	Hi !

224	I think Enron and my career are finished.
225	John, Thanks for the note.
225	Yeah things look pretty lousy here at the big E. From first to worst in 4 easy weeks.
225	The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away.
225	Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy.
225	Hang in there with ONE.
225	I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.

228	hope the family is doing well.
229	Can you believe it ?
229	cat sleeping with dogs....
230	Greg, I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions: 1).
230	This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms.
230	We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...) 2).
230	I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was.
230	but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.
230	I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.
230	Good luck, Andy
231	There is a lot of confused bullshit floating around.....
232	Mooney's are great planes and are very fast.
232	I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle.
232	They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever.
232	Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy.
232	The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward.
232	They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy.
232	Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.
233	Errol pleae make sure to put anything not mentioned by Justin into my book.
233	Thanks.
234	what about crude straddles ?
235	We should be watching this...
236	I can take this mission.
236	Please advise.
236	Andy Zipper
237	no problem.
237	I just received my copy of the new policy with AIG and will send you proof.
238	Thanks Jeff.
238	We'll let you know.
238	Regards, Andy
239	Please give me a call at your convienence.
239	Thanks, Andy Zipper
240	Jay, Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night.
240	I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.
241	FYI
242	got this from late friday.
242	have you ever heard of him ?
243	Thanks for the note.
243	Let's talk real soon.
244	Jeff, Could you please give me a call regarding last weeks events.
244	I would really appreciate it.
244	Thanks.
244	Andy
245	GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday.
245	"His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry.
245	"He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow."
245	The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.
246	Let's do it.Sorry I didn't get the messages but lets's have dinner next tuesday if that works for you.
247	Monica, Things are a little bit unsettled right now.
247	I am working on them and will have something shortly.
247	Your patience is appreciated.
247	Andy Zipper
248	Can I please get an NG run asap.
248	Thanks.
249	Thanks, I think I am okay, but let's talk tonight.
250	Enron does not place NYMEX position limits on its desks instead using overall VAR limits.
250	If a desk is authorized to trade a particular instrument, such as a NYMEX contract or swap, the size of that position is governed by the VAR it generates.
251	email @ home: aazccb@swbell.net
252	Call me when you get a chance @ 713 419-0203 or 713 666-9737
253	Spoke with Rick Stuckey who advised me that a group of seven of them will be arriving today.
253	They would like to heave specific discussions regarding the Pro forma as well as EnronOnline technology starting monday morning.
253	Rick also adivsed me that they are amending the original term sheet that they disucssed with Greg Saturday night.
253	I will keep you posted.
254	Robert, Here are the two messages from "Jeff Lawson" and the response I got from Jeff Sprecher at the ICE regarding my complaint.
254	I appreciate your handling this matter.
254	Andy
255	I'm sorry, I did not get it.
255	Thnigs have taken an interesting turn here, give me a call.
256	yes.
257	Eddie, Thanks for the note.
257	This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it.
257	We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions.
257	I'm sure you have read about it.
257	After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision.
257	We're all hangin' tough.
257	Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family, your friend Andy
258	I received this, this morning.
258	I know you are busy right now with other things but I would really like this thing to stop.
259	Dave, This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001.
259	Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore.
259	So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today.
259	I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that.
259	I will keep trying though.
259	Andy Zipper
260	Dave, I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve.
260	I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning.
260	Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.
260	Andy
261	i'm considering this terminated.
262	I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name.
263	Rick, I've been thinking about this.
263	I think 18 mos.
263	for the average tenor of a trade is way too high.
263	For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be more in line with 4 months.
263	We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months.
263	I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it.
263	For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions: Average tenor: 5 months Average trades per day: 400 average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn.
263	This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7 You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year.
263	If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.
263	That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).
263	The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties.
263	You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty.
263	I am working on those numbers as I write this.
263	It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn.
263	When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.
263	As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?
263	Andy
264	Ted, Try these guys.
264	George is excellent.
264	I don't know much about Balal.
264	Hope all is going well for you and your bride.
264	I know I owe you a phone call, and I will pay the debt soon.
264	Best, Andy
265	Will do, brother.
266	no problem.
266	good luck.
267	no thank you.

271	See you soon.
271	Will do on the duds.
272	Sorry to see the absorption of TQ by APB.
272	I suppose it is all for the best.
272	Hope that you guys come out of it allright.
272	The irony is that TQ outlived Enron !
272	Haven't spoken to you in a awhile and hope that all is well with you and your family.
272	Call me when you get a chance to catch up.
272	Best Regards for the Holiday Season, Andy Zipper

276	Happy New Year, Andy
277	A friend who works in New York asked if I could recommend an attorney who does Will/Estate preparation.

281	wow, three weeks away from the kids !
281	brave and lucky man.
281	life is very edgy here waiting for this stupid auction to happen.
281	i don't really know what things will look like after even if we do get a bidder who wants to go foward.
281	stay tuned.
281	have a good time in oz.
282	George Bush, minister of the double negative: "Not over my dead body" will they raise your taxes.

289	Hate to pile on but I think KM is circling the drain here.
289	I told your mom a couple of weeks ago that there is high probablility they file chpt 11 by end of first quarter.
289	Get out while you can.
289	Hope boarding went well for you and you didn't break anything.
289	Andy
290	no problem.
290	they seem okay so far.
291	Dave, Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate.
291	Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him.
291	He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations.
291	When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks.
291	Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know.
291	Regards, Andy
292	I sent Dave a note.
292	I will foward your name to Lavo, re:NETCO/UBS.
292	Let me know what happens.
292	Andy

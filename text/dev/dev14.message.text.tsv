13	Of course I remember our conversation.
13	By now I'm sure you know you are on our interview list.
13	(If I told you prematurely, use it to your advantage somehow with your friends.) I've contacted one of our head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes.
13	It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David responds to me call.
13	Best regards, Jeff P.S.

17	I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.

65	This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other.
65	It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.
65	I'm almost of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.

66	Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything.

67	Jeff
68	It's not necessarily an either/or decision.
68	Michelle, do you think this is a good program?
68	Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

100	Draft: We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets: Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new finance origination activities.
100	In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets, and teams and lever our existing businesses with new this new focus.
100	(Do you want to put in his background--which you probably now more than I?) He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman.
100	Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker.
100	We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.
100	(Do you want to put in his background?) Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket relationships and industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.
100	Eric and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.
100	Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today.
100	Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination group.
100	Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page.
100	Heather was with Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives.
100	Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.
100	This group will be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses.
100	This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets, and discuss other markets in a macro sense.
100	We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.
100	In this group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.
100	This group will not be involved in customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.
100	Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives.
100	(anything else?)
101	Have susan m.

117	Are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you think are good?
118	Michelle, If you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers, you should consider assoc.
118	to interview analysts.
118	I would also like to put Kevin McGowan (who went to MBA but isn't on the list, as an interviewer for wharton, in Phila if possible), I'll leave it to you for interviewers.
119	I'd like to have a few people meet her, but am confident in Jennifer's ability to evaluate analysts.

120	Who is currentlyreviewing, and are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need?

157	Thanks for the note.
157	We are still looking at the value chain, but think we may have an idea.
157	I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we were in London.
157	Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much for us, and is probably the wrong way to run that group.
157	Interestingly, the cargill CEO hasn't met with us yet.
157	We have been trading softs, but very small.
157	Next time Gary Hickerson is in London, which should be soon, I'll have him give you guys the story, and ask for more of your input.

174	Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to come to his group.
174	I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, and wanted to catch up with you on this matter.
174	I'll give you a ring by week's end if we want to proceed.
174	My initial reaction is that it probably makes sense....
174	Jeff
175	Mark, Thor, and Todd, Thanks for the video conference this morning.
175	Mike and I are convinced weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.
175	One issue I would like to address is EnergyDesk.com.
175	It seems like an interesting idea, but I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in doing in NetWorks.
175	I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.
175	To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com.
175	I will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues.
175	Regards Jeff
176	John was not interested in Mike after I spoke with him.

186	yes, of course.

187	I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon.
187	I wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us whatever freedom we want with the ship.
187	I'm not sure we should kill ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a spot market.
187	Maybe EOL.
187	Any thoughts?

203	Jeff
204	I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 2186 contracts of crude and Botchlett's getting shorter 2141 heat contracts.
204	Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave's Var went down only 687 thousand to 3.1 million.
204	Where is Dave's var coming from?
204	We need to be under our Var tonight.
204	Dave and Don--please take care of this.
204	Jeff
205	John, you guys have to be under Var tonight before we leave for the evening.
205	That means buying on access if necessary.

209	Also please pass the trade idea you have to Fred Lagrasta's group.

211	Explain to me why Don S. went golfing at 3 pm and you have this huge var violation in his book?
211	I'm not sure that was the best idea he's ever had.
212	FYI.
212	I sent this monday 4pm if you hear any rumblings.
212	Jeff
213	It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the following: Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy (?), and no real weather anywhere in the world.
213	I think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively.
213	I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US.
213	electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.
213	Given that, and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a problem, let's be as flat as possible.
213	I'm ok with spread risk (not front to backs, but commodity spreads).
213	The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for everyone's passion with respect to the markets.
213	As such, I'd like to ask John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon.
213	and Wed.
213	Thanks.
213	Jeff
214	Hi Lea, What are you thinking about with Jeff (Koons)?
214	Jeff
215	John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right.
215	According to john, the group significantly reduced postions (on the whole).
215	What about the forward forward vol?
215	Have we looked at that?
215	My instinct is that something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report.
215	I'd like someone to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us with "what if" scenarios throughout the trading day, and who can work with Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue.
215	Also, I'd like to isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var each day.
215	Jeff
216	Great.
216	Thanks.
216	Jeff
217	Thanks for the clarification.
217	Get it listed if you like.
217	Jeff
218	Do you have an answer for me regarding the simulation I asked you to run?
219	I'll defer to you.
219	How does this supplement your reports now?
220	Yes, there is a formalized process.
220	After Credit and Legal, and in most cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.
220	For Doug to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.
220	Please contact Brent Price for our DASH.
220	(Deal approval sheet) Jeff
221	Is this why BP thought to squeeze the market?
221	Jeff
222	I'm looking forward to our drinks/dinner of woes.
222	(But not too long on woes, I don't like not being in a good mood).
222	When is good for you week after next?
222	Jeff P.S.
222	I really don't like that expression "misery loves company" by the way......
223	please print
224	Thanks.
224	Good job.
225	FYI
226	I had to cancel my trip to Phila today--bummer.
226	Nov 7 is fine.
226	(I'm out of town this sunday for one week) I'm psyched about australia, but only for two days is a little sad.
226	Anyway, I'm here through sunday if there is a woe emergency.....

230	I have forwarded your resume to John Lavorato, who runs gas and power.
230	Thanks.
230	Jeff
231	I'd be happy to look at his resume.
231	Thanks.

232	I thought Jere O was going for me.
233	can we spend a few minutes talking about eol?
233	I've only gotten response from Jeff
234	FYI.
234	I'd like to be number 2 behind ENA.
234	And a close 2nd that is.
234	This should be a priority for us.
234	I'd like to set up a meeting shortly to put together a strategy on how we can get there.
234	More to follow.
235	please put me on the continental flight to tokyo on sunday as well.
235	thanks.
236	Thanks for the thought.
236	We are trying to get more fund business already through Per in the NY office.
236	Do you have any funds you'd like to sign up.
236	In terms of products, I was thinking more depth in products we feel comfortable managing.
236	Maybe different spreads/cracks, whatever.
236	You can control product launch, not the funds.
236	Can you give a some ideas of more/new products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol.
236	What more products will your customers want?
236	Jeff
237	I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated.
237	The problem with the P&L loss is one of time.
237	We have given back 25 million this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time.
237	I expect traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints.
237	I'd be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year.
237	Of course spread trading is a good idea, but when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I'm being told doesn't make sense.
237	We'll get there.
238	I'll look for him on my calendar.
239	Looks good.
239	Coordinate with Chris and John and let's move on this.
239	Jeff
240	please print
241	Fyi.

242	Please get with michelle and let her know of exact details.

243	do you ever watch "Frasier"?
244	of course, it's a favorite.
244	the lesson i learned last night--and i wouldn't be surprised if i were your only friend who learns lessons from weekday comedies--is to be happy!...if you're free, let's go out tomorrow eve and have our brief woes drinks (and not wait 2 weeks), then put it in the past....

255	Hi bub, I could only see images 3 and 4.
255	I couldn't access the mayadon bowl or the lenoble.

258	I'm probably not available for a lunch meeting on this topic, so let's do it after the close.
258	Jeff
259	Thanks for the resume.
259	Nowlan and I will take a look.
259	Jeff
260	Is this a violation, or are we just shifting portfolios around.
260	Jeff
261	FYI
262	I couldn't open Ajna's email either, this morn.
263	Do you agree?
264	good thing i saved this, huh?

278	Have you been outside?
278	I have to leave early today!
278	Hope your dinner was great....
278	Jeff
279	No doubt about drinks with you being more fun!
279	(My haircut is perfect, you'll be pleased to know) I did go out with my neighbors last night--I needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st.
279	came over last night and backed out of his contract.
279	Boy was I annoyed.
279	And still am, but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me.
279	So I'm going to take out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back.
279	Want to go?
279	I'm thinking Tony's or something else fun/festive.
279	To be determined...but fun.
280	I'm out next week, but will be in touch with steve horn when i return.
280	Jeff
281	thanks.
281	sorry i missed you earlier...
282	thanks.
282	these are great updates....
282	Jeff
283	No thoughts on Skilling's speech.
283	He just needs to emphasize we are a great productive entrepreneurial company.
283	Any we're are largest energy trading and risk management house in the world.
283	It would be ok if he mentioned that I am a Wharton '89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group.
283	Students like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world.
283	(By the way, I'm the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad).
283	This speech he is giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit...
283	On another note, I have an idea for you.
283	Get on my calendar for early part of week after next (I'm going to the Japan office opening, then to sydney and will be in the office nov. 6) Keep a low profile on the xcelerator for a week.
283	Later, Jeff

326	Dan, set up a brief meeting with john and me on this.
326	Jeff
327	how did it reduce var if we added to the underlying positions?
328	Yes, I think it would be a great experience, and I'd encourage you to continue to meet as many people as possible in the organization.
328	Jeff
329	I still don't understand.
329	But we are net short crude, and Crude, companywide got longer 1000 contracts yesterday.
329	This is counter to what you aresaying below...
329	Jeff
330	I'd like access for me.
330	I think the crude and products guys are looking at it, so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement.
330	Thanks.
331	fyi, what is the purpose of this email.....
332	Given year end issues, we really need to be trading close to the vest now.
332	I was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was two days ago, and we need to scale them back.
332	I need the component var for those four structural trades we have today.
332	thanks....
332	Jeff
333	When you put a person feet first in a pail of cement to throw him off a bridge, how expensive is that type of cement?

335	Be sure to get Larry Lawyer, Brent Price, and Eric Groves involved.
335	This project is extremely important to Enron, and our LNG strategy.
335	If there are any resources you need, please let me know.
335	Jeff
336	set up a quick (no more than 30 mins) about this with me, nowlan, reck.

337	proceed.
338	see if you can print this....
339	I think you know about this....
339	On another note, I have 5 cases of Kistler in my office--should we crack a few?
339	Jeff
340	FYI.
340	Please check into this....
341	I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in the financial commit.
341	from us.
341	He was not receptive, and in the past, I've suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing their broadband needs.
341	Others here have thought about this at Enron (like the California University system).
341	Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run with this in a more direct approach and see what happends.
341	(Tom P. was open to all of this, of course).
341	FYI, thanks.
341	Jeff
342	I asked him (and John Nowlan) to call you about this project that looks pretty cool.
342	I thought you could lend a hand.
342	(John Montcrief also does wet shipping for the crude and products group in London and works for Nowlan as well.) It looks pretty interesting.
342	Let me know what you think.

346	Sorry YOU weren't there...
346	I'm on my way out for a lunch.
346	I'll call you later.
346	(I'm excited about the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should rename it the exec villiage!)
347	Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping, etc. has great possibility for Enron.
347	I'd like to get a group of people to talk about plans going forward, and will fill you in shortly on time, where, etc. One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it being cleared through public relations first.
347	Your comments were interesting, but I was concerned about perception.
347	Please coordinate public statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going forward.
347	Thanks.

353	Jeff
354	Hi, hope you are doing great.
354	I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you came over.
354	He has great international experience, and LNG experience.
354	He might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of doing business.
354	(Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with CSFB worth 19 million to us.) Overall a solid guy.
354	Let me know what you think.
354	(Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on projects together) Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, possibly to trade freight, etc. Jeff
355	thanks
356	thought you'd like this.....Jeff
357	You, as well.
357	Jeff
358	OK, so I didn't really think you'd be at the office at 9:30 pm when I left you a message last night, buy my day turned into a freak show.
358	Later Jeff
359	Everything was ok, just busy.
359	Good book?
359	I just started "When the sons of heaven meet the daughters of earth" have you heard of it?
359	I'd absolutely love to go the the Anne Frank thing, but I can't get back from the management conference.
359	I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.
360	Please select your reviewers for year end PRC.

362	Sounds like this week is busy, but I'm around next weekend.
362	We'll figure it out this week.
362	No message yesterday, so I rescheduled it for late afternoon today, can wait.
363	You got it.
363	Jeff
364	Please expect a phone call from Andrew Makk, currently in the Mid East group, who is interested in exploring opportunities in each of your areas.
364	He is a very qualified individual who would be a tremendous resource in any of your groups.
364	Thanks.
364	Jeff
365	As I was packing some books this weekend, I stumbled across an old copy of The Story of O, and almost fell over.
365	I knew I had heard of that book--I must have read it some time ago--I think it was orig published in 1954 or 1965.
365	Now I remember how much I didn't like it!
365	Hope you've recovered from all your parties.
365	How was the book dinner.
365	Did I mention I had a spur of the moment party last night?
365	Jeff
366	I'd like to know how we purchased the Katz.
366	Was that outside our budget, and in Ken's dining room budget?
366	Mike and I will get together and address the points you bring up below.
366	Looking forward to our meeting.
367	As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this business unit.
367	This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position management from a worldwide perspective.
367	Our ability to gather data and to show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.
367	As important is one pricing desk.
367	Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.
367	To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.
367	ALL LNG contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.
367	It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.
367	We all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our businesses.
367	Regards Jeff
368	Absolutely I will call him.
368	Let's talk about a coordinated strategy with him.
368	Come up today when you get a minute....Jeff
369	Details to work out with HR.
369	Of course you will have significant input and presence.
369	Jeff
370	Speak with Nowlan.
370	Thanks...Jeff
371	print
372	Come by.
372	I'll shed some light....also I'd like to talk to you about opportunities within EGM.

376	Wow.
376	Jeff
377	Great.
377	I'll have Jennifer set up a phone meeting.
378	Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec.
378	committee members, I'll take the Analyst/Associate program.
378	We've been incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn , and I'd like to replicate our approach company wide.
378	I'm convinced with my help, we can do a world class job.
378	I'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring, and other ways to improve the entire process (internal and external) around Enron.
378	Thanks.
378	Jeff
379	please take car of.
380	please get on calendar
381	Great.
381	Thanks.
381	So what do you think of Crude for tomorrow?
381	Jeff
382	fyi.
382	print
383	Hi John Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.
383	As we go forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.
383	One of which is weather worldwide.
383	Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and forward.
383	We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.
383	I would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.
383	Mark and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you advised.
383	Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than go on in an email.
383	I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.
383	Best-- Jeff
384	Of course I want to get together next (this?) weekend.
384	In fact, the house should be almost done, and I'd love to show it to you, too.
384	I'm pretty open also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow).
384	Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity balls, social scene, etc. So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show.
384	I made everyone wear Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of champagne (as much as possible!) Fun, casual, and last minute.
384	For not being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun.
384	Went to my first exec committee meeting.
384	Pretty interesting.
384	But can't wait to hear about your parties for Vicki and Dan....
385	Funny....How's your day going?
385	Put me down for freak show.
386	George, I just saw the updated 4Q earnings outlook, and saw Jupiter, and British energy off the sheet.
386	Is Jupiter off because of the Massey problems you mentioned today.
386	What about British energy....
386	Jeff
387	The reason for the memo before was because the India guys still don't understand.
387	Hopefully this clears up their ideas about a separate marketing and trading shop in India.
387	Have you had time to think about Russell Dyke?
387	Jeff
388	Any updates on the Gdansk refinery, or should I assume that the deal is dead?
388	Jeff
389	Thanks for the update.
390	Thor, I'm getting stuck in a meeting at that time and will follow up.
390	Thanks.
390	Jeff
391	Please set up a phone call.
391	thanks.
391	Jeff
392	what do I need to do with this?
393	Saturday is looking better right now.
393	I hope that is still ok.
393	Let me know.......The assoc/analyst dept is trying to kill me.
393	More later

423	promote brad.
423	also, I believe sara mulholland (analyst) is eligible, and I would like to promote her to associate.
423	(when she started at enron, the time requirement was 18 months for promotion) Please get back to me.
423	Jeff
424	I'm not sure it is a good idea to go.
424	can we talk about this monday am?
424	Jeff
425	tried, but no can do.
425	call me, though.
426	Good afternoon Ida (better name for you than me).
426	EC was uneventful, given that I wore no crazy hat.
426	At the right time though.
426	I know the party will be great--try not to stress too much, besides your plans sounded great and I'm sure everyone will have a great time.
426	I'm leaving in a little while to go to the closing ( and collect some cash!), and am out the rest of the afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile!
426	In case you were wondering, I used almost a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it.
426	Ideas?
426	Later.
427	Thanks for the update.
427	I think it shows how starved for new products these exchanges are.
427	I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.
427	It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?
427	what do you think?

436	How's it going?
437	I'm not happy today.
437	Going back to last night, I got home, fell asleep on the couch in the new house, went upstairs at 4, and slept til 830.
437	Late all day, and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and Jeff Skilling.
437	I can't describe the weight of the world feeling I have, and I'm not good at not being in control.
437	I wish I had the answers.
437	How are you?
438	I had so much fun last night!
438	WHEN can we do it again?
439	Thanks for the email.
439	I'm not in love with this deal, and Nowlan is not inclined to do it, but we will have Pierre look at it.
439	By the way, it was 72 and sunny at my new house.
439	That is the forecast forever there.
440	please print
441	PLEASE call me Jeff.
441	When I'm old, grey, and heavier, then you call use a more formal salutation.

441	Jeff
442	Boy did I unpack last night.
442	I couldn't go to sleep so I went a little crazy.
442	Tuesday is good.
442	we could have a frasier marathon.
442	Which one of us is cooking at my house?
442	Would it be crazy if I asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas party next sat?
442	(Nothing like email to ask that sort of question, and I certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it) I have to head home to work out for a few hours....
443	Thanks for the reminder.
443	Yes I'd like to be included in your jan 1, 2001 contribution.
443	I will attend to this with the necessary paperwork in mid Regards, Jeff
444	Talk to scott tholan, who runs competitive analysis.

445	I'm with Dave.

446	When she was hired, there was no 3rd year analyst program.
446	She is going to be placed in the trading non-rotational program, as well.

446	Jeff
447	yes, now i can go after each trader.

454	He will be in London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with him.
454	Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.
454	Mark Frevert is having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.
454	Later, Jeff
455	I just spoke with mike robertson and told him we are ready for a weather person in london now.
455	(I mean NOW) He will coordinate with you.

461	Hey, I'll be around this weekend, trying to get myself together.
461	I can't tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently, and I think our conversation while I was awol (in NY for the day last weekend) really got to me.
461	I'll tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day.
461	(The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing).
461	I think that threw me for a loop too.
461	Oh, your message got to me this morn.
461	Please don't ever think you are bothering me.
461	I guess I'm a little less mature about my emotions than I thought.
461	(I know this is all personal, but email seems to be a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now).
461	I'm not sure that my home number is on yet, so the cell phone is where I'll be.
461	Thanks for checking up on me.
462	I have McKinsey sending over another Glass Market presentation, and you should have it shortly....

486	Will do.
486	Did you need something the other day?
486	Jeff
487	Thanks for the email.
487	Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of Joe.
487	He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has added much value to our organization.
487	I was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.
487	I would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.
487	In addition, I could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products.
487	(Which I will remind you about frequently) I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as well.
487	Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both respect your business sense.
487	As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.
487	I'm Jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.
487	Jeff
488	I will be in Phila.
488	Please grab materials for me.
489	Sorry it's been so hard.
489	Nothing meant by it.

490	Yes.

522	Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks.
522	I've asked Mark Tawney, Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.
522	His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge research.
522	We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship.
522	If there is anything else I can do, please call.
522	It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.
522	Again thanks for your time.

551	I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship.
551	I really want to see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.
551	I do know glen doesn't have all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only one these days.
551	My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go.
551	I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize friendships....
552	I'm still here--they're trying to kill me.
553	Hi Hillary, hope you are well.
553	Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it tomorrow.
553	I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely thoughtful of you to invite me.
553	I hope you have a great time.....(I'll send something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...
553	Best, Jeff
554	No problem!
554	In fact, it is likely I'll be in NY wed-sat next week--I'm sure I'll stop by the gallery.
554	Hope to see you...
554	Jeff

563	please put in rolodex.
564	Love the new place!
564	Hopefully you kept warm last night!
564	(You didn't have to sleep in your car, did you?) (Or did you have to drink the champagne to keep from freezing?) Unfortunately I won't know about the Lay's party until tomorrow.
564	Hopefully it will work out.
564	My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it.
564	Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark?

564	Later Jeff
565	So I looked on the dec 15 issue--where did you see my name?

572	How's Alexandras' sales today?

583	Low numbers.
584	Thanks for the update.
584	Is there another piece (external attachment) neededfor web use?
584	Sounds like you are doing well.
584	Regards, Jeff
585	Please take me off the distribution for this report.
585	It is hard to read, and not terribly useful to me.
585	Do we need this report at all?
585	Jeff
586	Candidly, Mark wanted to leave it open as to whom it would report.
586	He wantto have control in it's growth and staffing, although it would be coordinatwith Thor.
586	Mark (and I) talked to Thor about this a while ago, and will begin weekly video calls in the new year about strategy, updates, new products, and growing this business continentally.
586	(Mark was still concernabout the members of the Oslo weather group that Thor managed poorly--in Mark's mind).
586	I'm sure we will get to a point that works best organizationally with Thor having a role.
586	However, when you look at the P&of the business, is doesn't illustrate his support of the business, which ware addressing.
586	Hope this helps, and you are relaxing a little....
586	Jeff
587	I know him from the gas market, and am not in love.
588	I'm going to try to go to 50....day is packed, and still haven't decided when to go to NY.....How's your day?
589	It doesn't seem my secluding myself from friends is helping my state of being.
589	I worked all weekend and played with the pups, but I'm not emailing you to tell you that.
589	Can I call you tonight?
590	I'm most likely heading out tomorrow night.
590	I think Rachel T is going solo to the Lay's, so I figure she should come with us--but she is away until tomorrow.
590	Do you know someone named Melanie Herz?
591	I'm going to NY late tomorrow night for the holiday party there, and then am going to wyoming to hang out for a few days, and I can't wait...I'd like to catch up when you have time....
592	Sorry it didn't work out between you and EGM, but I'm sure you made the right decision for you.
592	Best of luck.
592	Jeff
593	Will do.
593	Thanks for your help

604	Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan.
604	He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the business.
604	He's our guy, and I want to expand his role in the group, as well.
605	couldn't see it.
605	Have a great holiday.
605	Jeff

628	I have a book you should read--How to Raise a Puppy--by the Monks of New Skete.
628	These Monks have perfected the art of raising a dog--so they think--but the book is helpful.
628	I'm leaving at 1 ish.
629	How was the trip?
629	NY was great, but I got back so late, you wouldn't believe, I missed my flight to Jackson.
629	I was pissed.
630	will do.
630	What's the pups name?
631	again
632	I was just thinking about API on eol.
632	Let's look into it Jeff
633	I'm out of here.
633	Have a nice afternoon.
634	Do you guys get this?
635	Let's get together on this and have a conference call.
635	Thanks.
636	I have the book for you.
636	What is your location?
636	Are you crate training the pup?--I did and it is a great idea.
636	I have an extra crate if you need...they are pretty expensive so if you want you can have this one.....
637	send to lavorato for gas.
638	Should I send the book to your location?
639	sure--it's on its way...
640	I've known her for some time, and interviewed her on the gas floor, and we didn't really have a fit.
640	I'm not sure what I'd do with her
641	For the roundtable: Gas: John Arnold, Phillip Allen, Mike Grigsby, maybe Hunter Shively Pwr: Fletch Sturm, Rogers Hearndon, maybe Kevin Presto Oil: John Nowlan, Bill White, maybe Adam Gross Equities: Gary Hickerson, Michael Bradley Other: Vince Kaminski, Jen Fraser Have I left anyone off?
641	What do you think?
642	Great.
643	Sorry, you know how I like one word answers...When are you back?
643	There is a lot of info of the gas floor--ie handouts, that I'm not getting.
643	Your work is invaluable, and it is getting a lot of notice internally.
643	Good job.
644	what does he want to do, and what was his year end rating?
644	Enron North America Corp.
645	please print
646	Mike and I have already seen his resume.
646	I know him from the gas market, and am going to take a pass on David.
646	Thanks.
646	Jeff
647	Please address.
648	What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the Dhabol supply contract?
648	That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if necessary.
648	Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful.
648	Thanks.
649	If he is interested in gas trading, send his info to lavorato Enron North America Corp.
650	I'm around
651	Let's send our a memo to deal makers, book admins, and business heads to remind everyone what the process should be regarding desk notification of big transactions/cash flows.
651	Why don't you take a stab at writing a memo, send it back to me, and I'll review.
651	Let's try to get it out this week.
651	Thanks.
652	What's up with the ads for the NY times, WSJ, and FT?
652	(Crude and product traders) Jeff
653	The US/UK Arbitrage book, the Finland Arbitrage book, and the Products Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down, and no positions are authorized to go into those books going forward.
653	In addition, all positions in those books must be pulled out as of today, and I want them removed from the P&L reports I get.
653	Also, we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour, 4 cent wide EOL crude market.
653	Thanks.
653	Jeff
654	Starting tomorrow, Jan 3, the London Distillates book run by Ross Koller will have a max var position of $1 million.
654	Chris, please take care of this with Ross.
654	Thanks Jeff
655	Niamh Clarke, Chris Mahoney, and Per Sekse are in Enron Global Markets.
655	You have them in the wrong business units.
655	Thanks for correcting.
655	Jeff
656	Unfortunately I cannot be there.
656	What about Grey Whalley?
656	(Even though he is Stanford)
657	I understand, however, each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader.
657	Ok if you want to take over arb books, but they (positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader) must be managed without the team approach of books prior.
657	The 1 million Var applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&l sheets.
657	I don't know how many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross.
657	If ross get's bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap.
657	Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around.
657	Later, Jeff
658	Soon, soon, soon.
658	Last minute changes to the house.
658	I'll probably have a big open house within a couple of months, but I'll have you over sooner.

668	Did Jeff figure out finally that they stopped taping for the show "Survivor" a few months ago?
669	Yes, how should I proceed?
670	How's the pup?
671	I'd like a schedule c (or any other schedule we have) update.
671	Also, how do we start to accrue for bonuses for 2001?

673	Please make sure there there is no P&L or position effect in the crude books with the new 24 hour EOL product.
673	Thanks.
674	As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.
674	As you know, Enron has committed over $1million during the next four years to University of Pennsylvania, and Wharton..
674	I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number of summer employees.
674	I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer.
674	In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.
674	I am operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.
674	I will not accept the notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.
674	In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift certificates is viewed as good one.
674	I'm not sure that is a good use of Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends.
674	Jeff
675	sure.
675	is there anything specfic you'd like me to address.
675	what about a slide presentation--which I generally don't love, but we have some good ones around.
676	Thanks for all your help with Sempra.
676	Hard work, but certainly worth it.
676	On another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.
676	Bottom line, we are not taking this hit.
676	It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.
676	Thanks.
676	Jeff
677	Have a great evening--I'm out of here!
678	put on calendar
679	please take care of this
680	yes me and mike.
680	thanks.
681	I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business.
681	Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR (I believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).
681	Is this a Board question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?
681	On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues.
681	If you too need my help, let me know.
681	Thanks for your help...
681	Jeff
682	fine.
682	thanks.
682	Do you have copies of les annees 30 or 70?
683	If you take out the 24/7 book, there was no var violation.

690	Did you ever call him?
691	I think Prebon is out of the business, largely.
691	Have you checked with John Nowlan regarding which brokers he would suggest?
691	I'm not sure PVM is the right broker for all of our crude needs.
691	What about United?
691	Thanks.
692	Please schedule a meeting about the Dhabol LNG contracts with the following for wed or thurs.

776	Your insight into the region, and products will be helpful to our businesses.
776	Thanks for your support.
776	Jeff
777	As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.
777	(In a nutshell, what can go where) Can I get this ASAP?
777	Thanks Jeff
778	No problem about the book!
778	I'm sure it's a fun chew toy.
778	So it sounds like school is keeping you busy.
778	Let me know when you want to talk to my friend at Continental.
778	I'm so tired from work--I'm going to watch a couple of movies tonight at home--the media room is all done with carpet, etc. If you want to come over and watch movies and maybe eat that would be great.
778	Tomorrow I have friends in from out to town, a dinner on sunday for work, and I may be in London most of next week...

794	good job on getting him.
794	Jeff
795	Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.
795	Also thanks for the update on the new car.
795	My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such activity.
795	I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such.
795	Best regards, Jeff
796	did you call earlier today?
797	How was your weekend?
798	Oh my god--so much desire to run, but i have a dinner tonight--my last since it's time to get into shape.
798	Maybe I'll wire my jaws shut.
798	If my dinner is with a 19 yr old, I'm going to take the fork and poke holes in myself.
798	(That was my dream) I'll tell you about it tomorrow...
799	put on calendar
800	offer away.
800	thanks.
801	please print
802	so i had dinner with a college student.
802	could you break up with mark and date me?
802	that would be very helpful.
802	I really don't want to hear about someone's major for god sakes.
802	should i put myself on ebay?
803	was that last email the rudest thing i've ever said?
803	so sorry......
804	oh, i forgot to point out one more thing.
804	aren't you a dragon and mark a dog?
804	should i call the ghostbusters?
805	i'm ready to go.
805	however, will this new system give a slower connect to eol, etc?
806	hmmm.
806	hadn't crossed my mind........my dinner tonight just got cancelled!
806	how about a walk/run/abroller marathon tonight?
806	drinks after.
807	I'm an 8 of clubs, and a gemini; checking on the chinese animal sign
808	i do not manage an eol stack.
809	you are a june birthday right?
809	i'm may, and i don't think i'm a dragon--it's done by birth year, no relation to zodiac.
809	still checking...
810	ok, i'm laughing, thanks.
810	but NOW you get it!
811	I saw him this morn, and asked if he called you.
811	call him tomorrow or thurs, and i'll follow up......
812	Let's make sure she gets an offer.
812	Thanks.
812	Jeff
813	Howdy...How long has it been?
813	When are we going out?
813	How's everything up there?
814	What a fun weekend!
814	Mine was a little boring.
814	Did you dance at the club before or after you ate all those burgers?
814	How's the pooch?
815	Did you see the second austin powers movie?
815	I just had lunch and I feel like Fat Bastard.
816	Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.
816	It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives.
816	Going forward, I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar recruiting functions.
816	I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend.
816	We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.
816	I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend.
816	If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all responsibility going forward.
816	I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.
816	Jeff
817	In town, most of the time.
817	Is she ok?
817	(I didn't know about the Lara Liebman part, though)
818	I'm free until 4-- come up with my new CD!
818	I'm off to Phila tomorrow morn, and ny thurs morn and will be back thurs night.
819	very interesting--did not know.
819	when should you and I go out?
820	great, whatever you like.
820	what dates are good?
821	can you tell i need to relax?
822	FYI.
823	bingo.
823	probably a little lounging as well
824	I'll get with mike m.
825	I knew you could.
825	I knew you could.

852	how come we are not getting any (much) of that value?
853	I need a report that shows new products and when they were added, in addition to this summary.
853	thanks.
854	Both Stuart Staley,and Dan Reck are being moved to $175k base each.
854	In looking across our vp.
854	list, Mike and I felt like these are two of our top vp's, and we wanted to make an equity adjustment.
854	They are low at the vp level within ews.
854	Thanks.
854	Jeff
855	Let's get together on this in the next couple of days.
855	Thanks.
855	Jeff
856	FYI.
856	What do you think?
857	How was the weekend?
857	Mine was good--I met Dennis Hopper, the actor.
857	He is one cool dude.

857	Where sounds fun?
858	Hi Chris, Give me a ring tomorrow (tuesday) morn when you get a second.
858	I'd like to go over a couple of things and need your input.
858	Thanks.
858	Jeff
859	I thought he was in the running for the President position, after Pat died.
859	He phoned me today--did he indicate to you in what he is interested?

862	Jeff
863	Hey, I have an idea......
864	two things.
864	first, my friend at Nickelodeon wants to know more about your kids books (he also sees a need for a spanish language group of kids books).
864	second, I
865	WHAT is this?
866	Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r.
866	people with respect to robin menear.
866	she was listed as commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a commercial manager.
866	Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though this was a problem at mid year as well.
866	Of course he told me it had been taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.
866	he too was involved in the hiring decision.
866	Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.
867	this was the guy that hired fred d'ambrosia back to enron after he was terminated for cause.
867	a.g.
867	is an ok guy but i'm not in love.
867	i would however put him through the interview process.
867	i'll follow up.
868	sorry for the confusion.

888	He's in London, by the way.
888	Jeff
889	Hi Thor, Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing.
889	I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.
889	When I look at the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and I don't think that deserves this promotion.
889	What else does he do?
889	I'm also concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.
889	His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.
889	Jeff
890	here is the note I sent to Thor.
890	I'll wait for his response.
890	Jeff
891	Thanks for the invite.

915	Jeff
916	Hi Dave.
916	As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).
916	See how that looks on the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.
916	(I did go to the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat my group gave me--pictures to follow) Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?
917	don't be surprised if i ask you guys to take off that friday, too, so that we can be a little flexible with Bob.
917	R.
918	this is only one of the ads, right?

919	Jeff
920	Jennifer B. please print, Jen F. please get this on the fundy's page....Jeff
921	an update for both Mike and I would be great.
921	thanks.
921	Jeff
922	As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for 2001 and beyond.
922	In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.
922	Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.
922	Mike and I would like to address this as follows: we need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.
922	All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney.
922	Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.
922	It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or will be in EEL.
922	Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.
922	It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.
922	If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.
922	This restructure will similarly align weather.
922	Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure.
923	I'm still getting all the reports too late.
923	I'd like a night clerk to put together the reports so that I have them by 7:30 am.
923	Thanks.
923	Jeff
924	Hi, hope things are well.
924	I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels (merchant).
924	Have you been talking with Pierre about all of this activity.
924	George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract, and wants Pierre more involved with the business.
924	What do you think of this idea?
924	What are some of your thoughts regarding this business.
924	Jeff
925	thanks for the update.
925	I'll be here all day today and tomorrow.
925	Jeff
926	I'm writing from houston (TX) and I cannot find anyone here who shows your furniture.
926	Can you direct me to some one in this part of the country?
926	I have large outdoor spaces that I'd like to furnish with Brown Jordan.
926	Thanks for your help.
926	Jeff
927	I've asked craig breslau on the gas floor--a senior marketer (VP) who is well versed in this to give the lunch.
927	Pete De Leeuw was happy a senior Enron person could get there on short notice.
927	Regards Jeff
928	yes, eric can get on the trader track.
928	put some numbers together for these guys, and get back to me...Jeff
929	please get on distribution and put on web site.
929	thanks.
929	Jeff
930	I did receive an envelope from you last evening.
930	No problem to postpone our meeting.
930	However, when should I pick up the car?
930	Best, Jeff
931	tomorrow afternoon would be best.
931	thanks.
931	Jeff
932	I'd love to fly dan down (at our expense) to have him meet some appropriate people.
932	Let him know he should call me to figure out the best time to get him down here....have to go now though.......hugs Jeff
933	I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre).
933	However, we have to look at our internal and external options.
933	If you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron.
933	In fact it appears to be quite one-sided.
933	First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne).
933	Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities.
933	Third, execute.
933	I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.
933	Thanks.
933	Jeff
934	Great to hear from you.
934	Office number 713 853 1761.
934	Home 713 523 5077.
934	Give a ring when you can, and I'll get you set up for the summer.
934	Jeff
935	Your thoughts are dead on.
935	Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products.
935	Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.
935	Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.
935	(We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.) Proceed, but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue.
935	Let's not go down that road "officially".
935	By the way, rough is spelled roof.
935	Later.....
935	Jeff
936	Thanks for the email.
936	You make some good points.
936	I'm still working with HR to address your bonus.

937	I'll be happy to set you up with a strong schedule.

953	One of which is detailed below (from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.
953	I believe Carlo from Dow will be calling you guys shortly.
953	Take a look at the attachment and you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your businesses.
953	Jeff
954	Very different hotels.
954	It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle of of the city.
954	(near vendome and concorde area) very central to all of paris.
954	costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations.
954	Big lobby, lots of gold, etc. Great, but not as cool/hip as costes.
954	How's London and the marketing of the 24/7 product?
955	Can you include Bill White, Pavel Z, Rob Fuller, Chris Mahoney, Niamh Clarke, and the rest of the crude team on this types of reports.

960	Jeff
961	Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting: have you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in particular).
961	We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...
961	Best, Jeff

962	Thanks.
962	Jeff
963	Could you also include the following to all presenters: Also, as part of your presentations, Mike and I would like each of you to identify 3 to 5 companies that we are not currently doing business, but should be.

966	If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the hotel--it's great.
966	Also try to get a room overlooking the interior courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the french can.

979	Jeff
980	Hi guys.
980	I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting.
980	In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.
980	This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years.
980	In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing.
980	The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program.
980	I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.
980	You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.
981	Any pumping you can do would be appreciated.
981	Thanks.
981	Jeff
982	Is this something you or Doug F., or someone should attend?
982	Jeff
983	thanks for the note, as I did not know there was a meeting tonight.
983	I saw the show this passed weekend, and will try to make it tonight.

6	You are the sexiest woman alive!
7	Elliot, I need more info.
7	What zone?
7	Is it strictly an SC trade?
7	What is the shape?
7	Will it change daily?
7	Who is the SC?
7	What is the proposed schedule?
7	Who is the counterparty in Enpower?
7	I would like the info Tuesday morning if possible.
7	I will be out for the week starting Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. If this is not possible, Jeremy will need the info sometime later on Tuesday.
7	Let's talk Tuesday morning.
8	I entered all the Mega deals in CAPS.
8	We have them for at least another Month.
8	I also updated the excel sheet for Mega and created a JUNE folder.
8	June 1 file is also set up in that folder.
8	I have not pulled the June data into that file.
8	I have not checked out with anyone for June.
8	They will be ready to ' check out on Tuesday.
8	Make a point to call CRC and get any sc trades they have.
8	Callaway is a new deal we have .
8	The info I have is that it will be a sale for 9MW flat every day for 5years.
8	This is an EES deal.
8	and will need to be entered on the EES sheet and entered on CAPS.
8	I think APX1 will be the SC.
8	Foster and Richter know about this deal.
8	Just make sure it is accounted for as an EES deal, it will not appear in Enpower.
8	There is a wind deal that Elliot did with Edwards Air Force Base.
8	I don't have enough info on this yet.
8	It starts June 1.
9	shama lama ding dong
10	u mow mow
11	Somehow the commucication on these deals got fubared.
11	I've gone with the assumption that we bought 3mw NP15 and !2 sp15 at 295 and $280 respectively for June.
11	Did this happen?
11	If the idea was to flatten EES out , we should have sold to them.
11	Any insight would be appreciated.
12	I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THAT THE HUSKER BBALL TEAM MADE THE BIG TWELVE PROUD.
12	I'LL TAKE A DISTURBING THE PEACE CHARGE ANY DAY , JUST NO SLAPPING YO GIRLFRIEND KIND A CRAP.
12	HOW ARE THINGS ?
13	Diana, Please provide me with Enterprise Manager so can utilize SQL queries.
13	Thank You!
14	Lincoln Police obviosly have a automatic link to the press.
14	Or the press is pinging the rap sheets daily.
14	This is not news.
14	Don't tell me no aggies ever have fights with their girlfriends or punch out a guy over a girl.
14	Its only news because of Local papers and police want it to be.
14	Call the College Station Police and ask if any football players have been involved in any "assaults".
14	They'd probably tell you its not your business.
14	This brown thing is funny because the new boyfriend kicked his ass.
15	o and if you critisize my futba program again I'll pull your hair and scratch you belly and throw a basketball at you.
16	Dave, Went OK.
16	I gave Susan a few issues that need to be worked on.
16	1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.
16	2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.
16	Some progress was made on Generation.
16	If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP.
16	The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.
16	We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc. The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.
16	Susan was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd.
16	which may need some work on our part.
17	FOR JULY THESE ARE NET POSITIONS.
17	YOU ARE SHORT .
18	Dennis, I'm attempting to understand how the UC-Davis deal, if done, will impact us .
18	How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service?
18	One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group.
18	To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this.
18	Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System?
18	Can you give me a call or an e-mail?
18	The number below is correct.
18	Thanks!
19	wow.
19	this is bad news.
19	If he had pounded his girlfriend instead, I would feel better about our chances of winning a national championship.
20	Bob, I gladly pledge $50 and will have my company match it.
20	I admire your willingness to do this.
21	what is this?
22	this checks out on the volume
23	I'm very interested in going.
23	Keep me posted.
23	I'm sure Hannah will have a blast.

27	Where are the aggie headlines????
27	This is no big deal.
27	A 20 year old gets drunk,some asshole cops treat them like shit and they mouth off to the asshole cops, who being the only ones able to excercise the power trip, get the last word.
27	Same thing happened to me in Lincoln and I was not a football player.
27	I had no sanctions and my charges were dropped.
27	He will miss the opener because he's a player.
27	When will espn give equal time to all of the other teams who have drunk 20 year olds getting into trouble.
27	How are you by the way?
27	I really miss having you around, especially this time of year.
27	OUT
28	fyi for your neighbor
29	yeah, the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.
29	The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.
29	I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year.
29	Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.
29	The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.
29	their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.
29	We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.
29	We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.
29	The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.
29	The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.
29	I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.
29	I got your pictures.
29	Your daughter is really cute.
29	How will the aggies be?
30	Hey Dave, Of course I remember you!
30	And you were right, Saturday the 25th was my birthday(37).
30	I feel especially old now that I am surrounded by 24year olds.
30	I wish some old people like you were still around.
30	How dou you like Phoenix?
30	and SRP?
30	And how is your family getting along?
30	I have 3 kids now.
30	The last one is 19 mos old.
30	I am done.
30	We have more and more people around here.
30	I am the last of the "Texans" .
30	The rest all went back to Houston.
30	Brett Hunsucker went to ERCOT in Austin.
30	I think he likes it.
30	Miller and Forney and Smith Day are all working for Enron on the ERCOT desk.
30	I can't trade this place for Houston.
30	Drop me a line Dave.
30	Its been good to hear from you!
31	If you can do all that , you can beat KSU.
31	I think NU can beat everyone but OU.
31	CU will be tough at Boulder no matter what.
31	Its like UT playing the aggies.
31	They get up for it.
31	Also ISU will give us a game.
31	If our D is attacking and we have a pass rush.
31	We could be in the Title Game to play OU again.
32	Count me in. I'll give 10 and enron will match
33	I got it fed exed yeaterday
34	Please sign me up for the loser pool.
34	My pick for this week is Chicago.
34	The check is in the mail.
34	Thanks!
34	Phil Platter

36	No clue what you are talking about.
36	We'll be there.
36	2 adults 3kids
37	solid perspective on current situation.
38	AWESOME
39	My pick for week 3 is Buffalo Platter
40	I see Montrell discovered he had only one kidney and was forced to quit.
40	Too bad he didn't get an NFL signing bonus first.
40	I think they will miss him.
40	North Carolina should be easy.
40	Good Luck.
40	Be safe.
40	Universities are an easy place for Terrorists to hide.

45	Dear Don, I enjoyed your article.
45	You are right, we are a little sensitive.
45	That's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.
45	I must admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.
45	What irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had trouble with the law.
45	These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of.
45	Surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked.
45	My problem is that whenever a NU player messes up, it is news.
45	It's as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star reporter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners, just waiting for some "news" to break.
45	I don't think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them.
45	College kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly.
45	I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school.
45	It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering.
45	This all started when we were the defending and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman candidate in the backfield.
45	The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news because of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.
45	He became the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but enough already.
45	Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another Lawrence Phillips.
45	Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.
45	Let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced.
45	You are right, Most NU fans are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.
45	NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best.
45	Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams do well.
45	Take care.
46	Scotty, I want to talk with you about the position you have open.
46	Please let me know when you may be available to talk.
46	Thanks!
47	Bob, What's up?
47	Thanks for the recent e-mails.
47	Did you happen to get together with Lisa last weekend?
47	I am heading to Omaha the weekend of the 27th to see the folks and help them out with some things.
47	I will most likely get together with Orhan sometime that weekend.
47	Let me know if by chance you will be around.
47	Say hello to Traci.
47	be safe!
48	Hey!
48	I am going to Omaha the weekend of this game.
48	It is one of those games every true husker fan must attend.
48	Let me know if ya'll may be interested or just drop me a line to let me know that you are still alive.
48	I think the huskers can beat OU since our D has improved so much.
48	I worry about the Offense not showing up on every play.
48	We will need a better pass rush to beat OU.
48	How good are we this year?
48	We'll find out at this game.
48	KSU sucks.
48	OUT.
49	I don't know when I'll make it to Houston next.
49	It's been almost a year since I've been there and that was to interview with someone else.
49	I like it up here but can't help but feel I may have to return to Houston sometime.
49	The family is fine.
49	Kids are 8,5 and almost 2.
49	You can probably picture what our life is like.
49	Everyone is fine.
49	If you come up here for a game let me know, also if your son needs anything don't hesitate to ask.
49	I wish I sould sit in a sports bar with you and watch a game.
49	Not a lot of people to watch it with up here.
49	Haven't played golf in a long time.
49	I like your enthusiam when it comes to the Huskers.
49	I hope you are right and they decide to bring the wood every game.
49	I'm supposed to have some tickets through one of the brokers but haven't got them yet.
49	I bet I get stiffed.
49	I think $150 should get me in there otherwise but think I's rather watch it on tv for that much jack.
49	I'll get back with you later.
50	I'll be in Omaha this weekend.
50	I get there Thursday night and go back Monday afternoon.
50	I'll be spending alot of time with the folks but we should get together.
50	Later
51	sign me up phil platter
52	hey!
52	We are all fine.
52	How is Miller?
52	Did he survive the trip to Lubbock..
52	Ha!
52	He's right the aggies always get kicked in the cohones by the Red Raiders.
52	Must have been a good game.
52	I am officially poor now thanks to Enron's financial wizards.
52	You have to be glad you left.
52	drop me a line.
52	Take care!
53	which is da best marinate fo fryin turkee!
54	Brysch is fine.
54	I guess he bought a boat for fishing in the Bay.
54	He is still in Broadband and I think is safe.
54	With his skills he should be one of the guys to turn out the lights if that is to happen.
54	Enron Sucks.
54	The CFO and Skilling took my retirement for themselves.
54	I want to piss on them.
55	Hell yes!
55	Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B. His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.
55	I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.
55	We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.
55	Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.
55	I thought he was a little weird.
55	He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.
55	I would support Siegrist.
55	Do not forward this to anyone.
56	I'm still debating.
56	I have been invited to Jackson Hole the week before by some power brokers in NYC.
56	I don;t necessarily have to go to that but in light of recent developments at Enron, I may have to look at some networking opportunities there.
57	THANKS!!!!!!!!
57	YOU ARE AMAZING!
58	Just heard some Austin Powers sound bites reverberate through the floor.
58	It reminded me of the good ol days.
58	How the hell are you doing bcwd?

66	All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.
66	I hope this clarifies some things.
67	Mr. Ried, I thought I'd drop you a line to inquire about the energy marketer position you have had open.
67	I understand you had the position open internally and that if you did not find a qualified candidate you would consider outside candidates.
67	I am currently awaiting an offer from UBS, the new owner of Enron's wholesale trading assets.
67	I want to reiterate my desire to return to Omaha and to work for OPPD.
67	Please let me know of the status of your search for an energy marketer.

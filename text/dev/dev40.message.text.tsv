1	We have to get together soon.
1	I have sent you an invitation to our New Year's Day party, and I hope you can come.
1	By the way, congrats on all the success and good press on Fusion.
1	It is well deserved!
1	Merry Christmas!
1	Michelle
2	Gary, would you please send me by email the telecommuting policy and the agreement for telecommuters?
2	Thanks a lot.
2	Michelle
3	Jeff, here is information from Jon Chapman.
3	Let's discuss when you have a chance to review it.
3	Michelle Michelle, Further to our discussion on Tuesday , I am very happy to proceed on the basis of Jeff Dodd's draft Agreement ( and draft Data Protection Policy) .
3	Can you ask him to prepare a final version and let us have it , please.

3	Thanks.
3	Jon
4	Twanda, would you please check my calendar and book me yes if I am available?
4	Thanks a lot.
4	Michelle
5	I think we should have someone from the tax group also attend this meeting -- contact Jordan Mintz for the appropriate representative since he and I have discussed this issue already.
5	Thanks.
5	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
6	Twanda, would you please save these to my form directory and print them out for me?
6	Thanks a lot.
6	Michelle
7	Twanda, please make this a form and save.
7	Thanks a lot.
7	Michelle
8	Danny, I received another call from the lawyers interested in learning information about Chapparro.
8	Any information?
8	Michelle
9	Twanda, please calendar.
9	Thanks a lot!!
9	Michelle
10	If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we make major ones, including a segregation of FMLA leave from other types of leave --i.e., two separate policies.
10	Let's talk about this on Tuesday ----- Majorly important!!
10	Michelle
11	Privileged & Confidential David, As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment agreement.
11	I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.
11	I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment (salary, options, etc.).
11	Let me know if you would like any other information from me.
11	Michelle
12	Jeffrey, Thanks for the "thanks."
12	Also, thanks to you for the big wine bucket.
12	We used it at our New Year's Day party, and it worked great.
12	I must admit, though, that I still don't understand the purpose of the round thing that goes in the bottom.
12	I heard that Nathan took 30 steps the other day.
12	That is awesome!!
12	I know that you are thrilled.
12	Cameron's birthday party will be March 18 at 3:30 at Gymboree.
12	If your kids will be able to attend, let me know.
12	Talk to you later -- gotta go now.
12	Michelle
13	Richard, have you been involved in this?
13	Robert Knight asked about it.
13	Thanks a lot.
13	Michelle
14	Mark, Unfortunately, I do not know anything about EcoElectrica.
14	I contacted Michelle Blaine at the former EI (thinking that there was some confusion between Blaine and Cash).
14	Her assistant contacted me and said that, apparently, Coralina Rivera at the former EI has information about Eco Electrica in Puerto Rico.
14	I have left Coralina a message indicating that you are looking for information about EcoElectrica and requesting that she contact you directly.
14	Let me know if I can do anything further on this matter.
14	Michelle
15	Thanks for the consideration -- I did not expect much.
15	Also, I have faxed you my comments on response to Malme's motion to extend time to designate experts.
15	The comments should be self-explanatory.
15	Call me with any questions -- or have Tim call me.
15	Thanks.
15	Michelle
16	Kerry, Based upon your review of the attached, is there any way that one of our subsidiaries could decline to include bargaining unit personnel in receipt of this benefit?
16	Let me know asap.
16	Thanks a lot!
16	Michelle
17	FYI.
17	Michelle
18	Kate, here is the latest on Elektro.
18	Michelle
19	Twanda, please get this on my calendar.
19	Michelle
20	TWanda, please calendar and then make a file entitled "Employees in Right Company" and give to me on the date of the meeting.
20	Thanks a lot.
20	MHC
21	David, As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and other litigation matters.
21	We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.
21	The terms of that Agreement would include: 1.
21	He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters.
21	He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed.
21	2.
21	Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement).
21	After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.
21	3.
21	Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron.
21	Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA, -- Kevin's intentional acts, -- Kevin's gross negligence, -- Kevin's reckless conduct, -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.
21	4.
21	Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01.
21	The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.
21	In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement.
21	Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.
21	I am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to attend.
21	Michelle
22	Twanda, could you please check to see if we have this?
22	Thanks.
22	Michelle
23	Gene and Susan, Here is the draft award agreement for the plan.
23	Let me know if you have comments.
23	I will be getting with Brian Bloom this week with our comments to the plan document.
23	Michelle
24	TWanda, we need an amendment to this agreement.
24	Would you please do the form?
24	Thanks.
24	Michelle
25	John, Would you confirm (via a new email that I can print for my files) you have had the conversations with Dan Bruce, etc. about Entelligence that I scripted for you in a prior email?
25	Thanks a lot.
25	Michelle
26	FYI.
26	Michelle
27	Ok, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the distress.
27	Maybe we can chat later.
27	We will not be in Austin in the next few months.
27	We are going to San Antonio the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.
27	The first trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are marrying each other.
27	The other is for the Enron law conference, which is Wed.-Friday.
27	We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party time!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.
27	I am working with Butch Hayes at F&J.
27	I haven't been too involved in the matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I like him.
27	Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.
27	Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.
27	But, it probably would have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need that right now.
27	If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it -- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.
27	Plus, Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.
27	He started at a new school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School -- a Montessori school about a block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.
27	It is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.
27	Little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even get me started on helicopters).
27	On the other hand, I feel this enormous responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.
27	Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.
27	Enough waxing philosophical.
27	I've got to get out of here at some point, so I'd better get back to work.
27	Later.
27	M
28	Kate and Felicia -- that org chart was from me.
28	I thought there was an enclosure note.
28	Sorry!
28	Michelle
29	Twanda, would you please make this a form entitled "Canada Release" and then draft one for John Gorman?
29	I'll fill in the blanks.
29	Thanks.
29	MHC
30	David, FYI.
30	Let me know if you have any comments, which I will give to Dawn.
30	I'll review it and get back with Dawn.
31	Yikes!!!!
31	I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there.
31	I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an empathetic ear, give me a buzz.
31	Talk to you later.
31	Michelle PS I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello.
31	She is going to be teaching at the same school that Cameron attends!
32	Great.
32	Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday night.
32	If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.
32	It is Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.
32	I understand if you don't want to join us, though.
32	Ballet isn't for everyone.
32	Let me know.
32	Michelle
33	Twanda, please print this out and also print out the consulting services agreement form for my review with this.
33	Thanks.
33	MHC
34	Hello.
34	Do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement form?
34	Michelle
35	Twanda, would you please make this change to all forms?
35	Thank you.
35	Michelle
36	Twanda, please print all these.
36	Thanks.
36	Michelle
37	Thanks for the draft.
37	Delaware is the proper state.
37	I thought the deferral information was sent to you already.
37	There is no "plan" document per se.
37	Instead, there is a description of the program.
37	I will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it.
37	Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference call on the other question.
37	My morning today is wild; tomorrow probably is better.
37	Thanks.
37	Michelle
38	Tony, the lawyer's name is Gary Herrmanns at Orrick.
38	His number is 415-773-5451.
38	Thanks for the message about Trey!
38	Michelle
39	Just when you thought it was safe .
39	.
39	.
39	I have received a question from NEPCO about Project 50.
39	Apparently, they have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company.
39	These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.
39	Originally, these employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp.
39	Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50 options because they are not "regular, full-time or regular part-time employees" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.
39	What are your thoughts on that?
39	Should they be included or not?
39	My reading of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary employees.
39	Do you know how other temporary employees were treated?
39	Let me know what you think.
39	Thanks, as always.
39	Michelle
40	Drew, At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.
40	I think that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we begin to move towards shared services across the organization.
40	Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we really need to put some in place).
40	Thanks.
40	Michelle
41	Twanda, please save this as a form.
41	Thanks.
41	MHC
42	Please print the email and the attachments.
42	Thanks.
42	MHC
43	Pat, here are the draft plan documents.
43	Any comments would be appreciated.
43	Michelle
44	Here it is.
44	Michelle
45	Twanda, please save under Japanese labor law memo and print for me.
45	Thanks.
45	Michelle
46	John, Do you have any comments on this letter?
46	Rick and I would like to send it out soon.
46	Thanks.
46	Michelle
47	TWanda, please print and then save the attachment as HR Confidentiality /Non-Solicitation agreement -- print for my review and editing.
47	Thanks a lot.
47	MHC
48	I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP incentive plan.
48	She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.
48	Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan.
48	Jeanne, could you please circulate one?
48	I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this process should not wait for me.
48	Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we should be ready to finalize it.
48	Michelle Cash
49	Tara, You are right -- those changes were not included.
49	For Vice President level employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.
49	The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.
49	I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that these changes could not be made.
49	Michelle
50	Call me if you have any questions.
50	I hope this is better late than never!
50	Michelle
51	Elspeth, do we want to do a new agreement, or simply assume the obligations in the old one?
51	If the former, I'd do a new agreement.
51	If the latter, I believe I simply can do an assignment agreement, once I receive a copy of the current agreement.
51	It also depends on the language in the old one, and whether we believe it protects ENA.
51	So, we'd have to look at it.
51	Sharon, do you have the file on this person?
51	If so, let me know, and I will have someone come and pick it up.
51	Thanks.
51	Michelle
52	FYI re: FMLA policy
53	Jeff, What is the status of the document?
53	I expect that Jon will be calling me any day.
53	Thanks.
53	Michelle
54	Twanda, please save this in whatever power point directory you have.
54	Then, print for me to revise for a presentation to Energy Operations for Norma.
54	Save this one, though, because the one I am going to use for Energy Ops will be much shorter, and this one has good stuff in it!
54	Thanks.
54	Michelle
55	Kerry, thanks for this -- wow, is it long!
55	Michelle
56	FYI
57	How is the research going on whether we can set up the plan the way we want to?
57	My understanding is that you were going to do some research for us.
57	Thanks.
57	Michelle
58	Please keep your file open.
58	We still are talking with her, and probably will need additional revisions to the document, as well as your advice and counsel.
58	Thanks.
58	Michelle
59	Felicia, In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before someone can be classified as exempt.
59	However, because there are certain exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.
59	My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.
59	If they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the overtime rate.
59	You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the overtime rate.
59	If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not be an issue.
59	Let me know if you have questions.
59	Michelle
60	Sylvia/Sharon: I assume that copies will be provided to me and Kriste as well.
60	I would appreciate the opportunity to review them.
60	Thanks.
60	Michelle
61	Rick, are you on this, or should I get on it?
61	Michelle
62	TWanda, please print for me.
62	Thanks.
62	Michelle
63	FYI.
63	Michelle
64	Hi, Charla, I have reviewed the additional fields you described.
64	Most of them look fine with me.
64	I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.
64	The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.
64	As I have discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from any other source.
64	It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.
64	What is the purpose of this inquiry?
64	Are we trying to determine whether a person is eligible to work in a particular country?
64	If so, it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.
64	We already have a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work visa to another.
64	Any other information may not be necessary.
64	The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don't want to keep on a system.
64	For example, if a person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child .
64	.
64	.
64	it really is not a job-related issue.
64	What is the purpose of this question?
64	Is there a less intrusive way to ask it?
64	Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job-related.
64	What is the purpose of that inquiry?
64	Is there another way to gather that information?
64	Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above.
64	If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call.
64	Michelle
65	I inadvertently forgot to "Reply to All" when I sent this response to Michelle
66	T: Would you please set up a meeting with Shanna?
66	Thanks.
66	mhc
67	Twanda, would you please print for my review?
67	Thanks.
67	MHC
68	T: Would you please print this and attached and file in BP amoco file?
68	Thanks.
68	MHC
69	FYI.
69	Michelle
70	Jon, it was attached to the bottom of his prior email, which I will resend to you right now.
70	MHC
71	Any idea why they did this?
71	Michelle
72	David, on point 2, that type of arrangement has to be approved by the Enron Executive Committee.
72	Let me know if you want a copy of the note describing that process, which was sent by Cindy Olson a few weeks ago.
72	Michelle
73	We are in the process of promulgating a data protection policy.
73	It should be out in the next few weeks.
73	It addresses all of those privacy, etc. issues.
73	Let me know if you would like a copy of the draft policy.
73	MIchelle Enron North America Corp.
74	We should get it today; I'll messenger it over when it arrives.
74	mhc
75	FYI.
75	I have sent them a copy of the draft policy.
75	I think it will address their concerns.
75	Michelle
76	That was sent to you by messenger.
76	Getting it notarized may take a long time -- is it necessary?
76	Michelle
77	Cindy, FYI regarding the labor/employment lawyer for EBS -- according to Sharon, she was asked to be point person for EBS.
77	I'll let you know when I talk with Mark, which should be early next week upon his return from London.
77	Have a great weekend!
77	Is Chelsea giving you a mother's day gift?
77	Michelle
78	Twanda, would you please print this for me?
78	Thanks.
78	MHC--my printer is not working (or maybe I haven't selected my local printer correctly)
79	FYI.
79	Here is most of the information.
79	Michelle
80	Twanda, could you please start Consulting Services AGreements for these entities?
80	I have asked Norma to get the rest of the information.
80	Thanks.
80	MHC
81	Mark, Do we need to say something about the fact that V&E is representing Ecogas and not the plan to ensure protection of the privilege?
81	MHC
82	Please print for me .
82	Thanks.
82	MHC
83	Linda, great job!!!!
83	I am happy with that result.
83	It makes things much easier.
83	Have a great weekend.
83	Michelle Please respond to lbroocks
84	I sent Milnthorp and Lemmons to you.
84	I sent Brown to Tara Rozen in London.
84	Clemmons final will go today.
84	Do we need to talk about Josey and Thompson?
84	Michelle
85	Tara, perhaps the Brown contract should have gone to Melissa instead of you -- sorry.
85	Could you please let me know if I need to re-route or do anything else on that agreement?
85	Oxley is anxious for it to get to him.
85	thanks.
85	Michelle
86	John, Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop.
86	In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing.
86	It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).
86	Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.
86	Why do they want this information?
86	Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?
86	As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.
86	I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed.
86	Michelle
87	Welcome to the heat!!!
87	If you would re-send your resume to me, I'll re-send it to my contacts here in town and let them know that you now are available.
87	I think I may have a firm that could use your skills!
87	Michelle
88	Looks good to me, although I will have a new fax number soon.
88	I will ask Twanda to send it to you once I know what it is.
88	Michelle
89	Very good response!!!
89	It struck the right chord, I thought.
89	MHC
90	TWanda, would you please call them?
90	Thanks.
90	MHC
91	Valeria, I will be out of town that day and cannot attend.
91	I will provide feedback via the feedback forms.
91	Michelle
92	FYI
93	Twanda, here is more information about the project for Baxter.
93	Michelle
94	could you please print these attachments in color?
94	Thanks.
94	MHC
95	Bryce, I am not comfortable with bringing someone in without an agreement.
95	I should have a draft to you this afternoon at the latest, so it should not be a problem for the person to start tomorrow.
95	I will ask my assistant, Twanda, to send you the confidentiality agreement that we require all contract personnel to sign so that you can get it to the person for signature today.
95	Michelle
96	Pete, I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which you are running from the legal side.
96	Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?
96	If so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible.
96	Thanks.
96	Michelle
97	FYI, I just learned that Jeff Golden is going to work for EES.
97	Michelle
98	Twanda, I will have inserts to the two agreements for Bryce Baxter from this document.
98	Michelle
99	Twanda, would you please print this for me?
99	I will need to have it executed.
99	Thanks.
99	MHC
100	Twanda, we need executables.
100	Michelle
101	Talk with Mary McKendrey (may be spelled wrong), or Pam Butler in corporate comp.
102	Right now, I am .
102	This meeting may take more than an hour, though.
102	Michelle PS, I think Pat Mackin should be included in this, if he is not already.
102	MHC
103	Linda, I haven't looked at the pleading, but it should be fine if it is simply a nonsuit with prejudice.
103	Thanks for your help on this.
103	MHC Please respond to lbroocks

108	THX----- Forwarded by
109	I got this email.
109	My address is Michelle.Cash@enron.com.
109	We're going to San Antonio tomorrow and then to Austin for a few days.
109	It will be nice to get away.
109	See ya!
109	Michelle
110	Twanda, would you please print this and also the attachment -- with the notes?
110	Thanks.

111	Hi, Kelly, Yes, I probably am the person to contact on this.
111	In fact, I am getting ready to circulate a draft data protection policy that would put Enron in compliance with EU directives.
111	Look for it in the next few days!
111	Michelle
112	Hi, Linda.
112	I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.
112	I was out on vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.
112	I hope that ELM has received the response by now.
112	Let me know if I need to do anything else.
112	Michelle
113	Kim, what day?
114	great news!
115	Don't worry about it!
115	Of all people, I understand about schedules being tight.
115	Good luck with the post-trial work.
115	Michelle
116	Trey, I want to go .
116	.
116	.
116	I wonder if that is possible.
116	Let's talk about it.
116	M
117	Alan, I just called our counsel on this matter this morning to find out the status.
117	I believe that Cline has different counsel now, and I will find out about this asap.
117	Michelle
118	I don't know anything about this!
118	MC
119	Do you know anything about this for Ecogas?
119	Michelle Cash
120	Kerry, What are your thoughts on this issue?
120	Michelle Michelle, We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you.
120	The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift.
120	Please review the following scenario.
120	For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift.
120	Interpretation 1 The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows: REG $400 SHIFT 16 Interpretation 2 Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows: REG $400 SHIFT 16 Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them?
120	Thanks for your help, Diane
121	David, I am with you.
121	In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.
121	I expect an answer by Monday or Tuesday.
121	Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.
121	Michelle
122	Kerry, this is the second of two messages.
122	Do you have any thoughts?
122	Michelle Michelle - Can you review the following examples as well?
122	USO means unscheduled overtime, UPG means upgrade and the UO1 means Upgrade Overtime.
122	If I should be forwarding these to someone else, please let me know.
122	Thanks, Diane
123	I am with you.
123	In fact, I sent these questions to outside counsel early this week because I simply have not had time to focus on them given everything else that is going on.
123	I expect an answer by early next week -- I hope Monday.
123	Sorry about not letting you know where this was .
123	.
123	.
123	.
123	Michelle
124	Twanda, could you please handle this if you haven't already?
124	Thanks!

126	Twanda, please print.
126	Thanks.
126	MHC
127	Gerry, should Sharon Butcher and Kriste Sullivan be included in the distribution list?
127	I would think so, now that we are back to "normal" staff meetings.
127	Michelle
128	Gene, What is the status of the ProNexxus situation?
128	Have we received anything from them?
128	If not, they are very shortsighted!
128	Michelle
129	Kim, Have you asked Brian to review it as well?
129	I think his input would be valuable.
129	Michelle
130	FYI.
131	Please print for me and put in my Japan file - please give me the file!
131	Thanks.
131	Michelle
132	Jane, I was not involved -- I think Sharon was.
132	Michelle
133	T: Please print these for me.
133	Thanks.

134	Twanda, if I am here, I would like to attend this lunch meeting.
134	Thanks.
134	Michelle
135	FYI.
135	Michelle
136	David, I did keep these provisos in the final draft, which will come to you today.
136	Michelle
137	Gina, check with Erin Knouff.
137	I think she has it.
137	Michelle
138	Philip, have you had a chance to pull this information together for me?
138	Let me know when you think you might have it.
138	Thanks.
138	Michelle
139	Thanks, Pat.
139	I am sending you a copy of the opinion, which I got from the Daily Labor Report.
139	Michelle
140	Beth, do you really need me there?
140	I haven't been involved in KAFUS at all.
140	I'll be happy to go if needed.
140	Michelle
141	I think it would be neat to hear from George Bush or George W. Bush.
141	Thanks!
142	Twanda, would you please handle this?
142	Thanks.
142	Michelle
143	Kim, to speed things up, it is a good idea to cc: Twanda on all emails regarding agreements.
143	She can get it going if she reads it before I do.
143	see you later.

146	Thanks.

147	Twadna, would you please print and then file Ecogas (not due diligence file) for me.
147	Thanks a lot.
147	Michelle
148	T; please print this and any attachments and file under "Japan -- Pre-Employment Testing."
148	Thanks!
149	t: please print this and the attachment.
149	Then, file under "Japan -- Pre-Employment Testing."
149	thanks!
150	T: Please print and put in file "Japan -- PreEmployment Testing" thanks.
151	My information looks ok.
151	Thanks.

152	Twanda, please print this and attachment.
152	Thanks.
152	Michelle
153	Kelly, I am handling Mexico and Canada.
153	Thanks.
153	Michelle
154	Jennifer, Thanks for the email.
154	Cameron is great.
154	He loves his new school, even though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was.
154	Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and bulldozers and ..... ).
154	We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few weeks ago.
154	He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and "drive."
154	They also handed out plastic fireman's hats.
154	He had a blast!
154	I look forward to having you back on 36; I'm moving there as soon as they get my phone/computer set up -- I'll spend half days there.
154	See you later.
154	Michelle
155	The questions are as follows: 1.
155	Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board members so far?
155	2.
155	What is the general scope of such coverage?
155	Ecogas is a stand-alone company.
155	Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock and has three people on its Board.
155	I hope that helps.
155	Michelle
156	Shelly, because he should have received this much sooner, we should hand deliver the check as soon as we get it from AP if it is not done through direct deposit.
156	If it is, then mailing the pay advice is ok.
156	Thanks.
156	Michelle
157	Scott, would you be available in the next couple of weeks to meet with me and some of the HR reps regarding follow-up for employees who leave the company?
157	I would like us to be proactive in those situations.
157	Let me know your availability.
157	Thanks.
157	Michelle x36401.
158	Hector, Where are we with regard to the investigation into this matter?
158	I know that you've got a lot going on, and I didn't want that one to fall through the cracks.
158	Thanks a lot!
158	Michelle
159	Privileged and Confidential In our meeting on Friday, we talked about the summary of complaints that you three are going to do.
159	If possible, I would like to receive those by Tuesday night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday.
159	We are meeting with Beck/Olson on Thursday.
159	Let me know if that is impossible -- I know you all are swamped with zillions of other things!
159	Thanks.
159	Michelle
160	This works for me.

161	This is only a test.
162	Pat, fyi re: Evan Lovell's claim.
162	Michelle
163	Dale, here it is.
163	Michelle
164	Please handle.
164	Thanks.
164	Michelle
165	Please print this one only!!!!!
166	Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 -- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.
166	Are you planning to be gone then, too?
166	If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the weekend?).
166	I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.
166	Don't worry too much about me.
166	Gwyn is coming over to join us for dinner tonight, and Kay is dropping by tomorrow -- she offered to watch Cameron if I needed to do stuff.
166	I do miss you, though.
167	Mandy, Jane's language looks good.
167	I would add one thing at the end: "Of course, receipt of an H1B visa transfer and/or permanent resident status will depend on whether the INS approves those applications."
167	Michelle
168	I'll be happy to review it; please send it to me.
168	mhc
169	Twanda, we need to revise Shankman's contract as described below.
169	Thanks a lot!!
169	Michelle (Memo to Oxley)
170	Pat, Given that the new AESOP has been approved by the comp.
170	committee, do you think the language attached below should be revised?
170	(Or, should I ask -- has it been revised?).
170	If so, would it be possible for you to revise for inclusion in offer letters, etc.?
170	Thanks a lot!
170	Michelle
171	Dawn, I have not seen a request form for his contract.
171	I believe that Teresa Bien was working on it with Mark Haedicke.
171	I am copying her on this email so that if I am mistaken, she can let me know.
171	Thanks.
171	Michelle
172	Fran, I am not sure that I ever had an executed document on the loans.
172	By copy of this email, I am asking Twanda to send you what she has that has been signed by Dosier.
172	I will let you fight the payment battles!
172	Michelle
173	Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language.
173	I have another one for you.
173	The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may be facing outsourcing.
173	There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the transition.
173	Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated.
173	Thanks.
173	Michelle
174	Here, at last, is the email response to the OT questions.
174	I haven't had a chance to study it, but I am sending it "hot off the press" upon receipt by me.
174	Let's discuss if there are any problems.
174	Michelle
175	Here it is, you nabe.
175	Michelle
176	Dave, I am available the 27th for mediation in the Evan Lovell case.
176	Michelle
177	Tara, It is ok for Mark to sign this in lieu of David.
177	Michelle
178	Margaret, thanks.
178	My title, FYI, is Assistant General Counsel for Enron North America Corp. Thanks.
178	Michelle
179	Kriste, which business unit would have handled this?
179	I would need to confirm with them on it.
179	I have no problem with the dollar amount.
180	Would you please juggle the rest of my calendar to accommodate this?
180	I've got two meetings at that time to reschedule -- try Wednesday, or with Amy on Tuesday morning.
180	Thanks a lot!
180	Michelle
181	Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?
181	Or, should we talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?
181	The bottom line is, that the non-compete probably should stay as is, even in the case of RAC.
181	Let's discuss.
181	Michelle
182	Hector, what is this all about?
182	MHC
183	Scott, here is new language for the inclusion in the Japan agreement.
183	It still is long, but it is more current.
183	Let me know if you need any thing else at this time.
183	Michelle
184	Enclosed is new language for offer letters regarding the AESOP.
184	Let me know if you have any questions.
184	Michelle
185	Kerry, I think I sent a letter and a check for partial payment last week.
185	Let me know if you don't get it in the next few days.
185	Michelle
186	Tara, We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.
186	Have we already sent you executables?
186	If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, "Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."
186	The effective date still can be 6/1.
186	Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?
186	Thanks.
186	Michelle
187	Dawn, did we ever ascertain whether Duke is being sued for fraud based upon his alleged conduct?
187	Michelle
188	Twanda, please print and then file -- GM/Labor Union
189	T: Please print this and attachment -- file in Japan file.
189	Thanks.

193	Michael, I met Amy today and look forward to working with her.
193	Thanks for the heads up about her arrival here in the States.

194	Thanks.

195	Charla, congrats and all the best in your new role.
195	I know you will enjoy the opportunity!
195	Michelle
196	Jim, Thanks for this.
196	Would you please let me know how much we owe?
196	Would you like to join us for the game?
196	Michelle
197	FYI.
198	Hello, all.
198	Please wait on including this language in the offer letters until we hear further on this issue.
198	Thanks a lot!
198	Michelle
199	Twanda, please print for my review.
199	Thanks.
199	Michelle
200	Trey, FYI.
200	MHC
201	Jim, If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!
201	I hope that you both can join us.
201	If not, let's plan on another arrangement.
201	We are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, it is close to the Watergate).
201	It was way less expensive than the Embassy Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).
201	We are renting a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to -- or, of course, we can take the Metro.
201	Talk to you later.
201	Michelle
202	Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege K2: I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME region.
202	My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).
202	This exposure could be high.
202	Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.
202	Let me know if you have any questions.
202	Michelle
203	Dear Gretchen: Wow!
203	You are thinking ahead!
203	What is a Leap Pad?
203	Is it something computer related?
203	I have never heard of it.
203	On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice and hot by then.
203	We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while we are there, so that is good.
203	We got new furniture in the living room -- a chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.
203	It amplified the need for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we go!
203	Stay cool -- Michelle
204	Don, I tried to call you this evening, but unfortunately missed you.
204	I am available in the afternoon tomorrow.
204	Please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, to confirm a time.
204	Her extension is 3-9402.
204	Thanks.
204	Michelle
205	Rhonna, you know there's an espeak with Cindy Olson on Friday at 10:00, right?
205	Perhaps that should be advertised in the floor meeting .
205	.
205	.
205	.
205	Michelle
206	Trey, Unfortunately, I do not know of any position at Enron that would be available.
206	I think that Bracewell may be looking for people, as might Littler, Mendelson.
206	I hope that helps.
206	Michelle
207	Matt, Thanks for your email.
207	I believe that there is an agreement in place between ENA and Enron Expat Services.
207	In general, the contract is between ENA and the employee, if the person is an expat.
207	The assignment letter covers the employee's transfer to Expat Services.
207	We haven't usually amended/assigned the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are through ENA.
207	If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, and I am happy to handle it.
207	If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.
207	I hope this answers your questions.
207	I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years.
207	If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions.
207	Thanks a lot.
207	Michelle
208	Brian, Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised by Janeth Rodriguez-Philhower?
208	Based upon her voice mail message, there is a strong possibility of litigation.
208	Your investigation into her allegations thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation.
208	Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.
208	Thank you.
208	Michelle
209	Here is another opinion to support my earlier thoughts.
209	Michelle
210	T: Please print this and attachments.
210	Thanks.
210	MHC
211	Thanks for the description.
211	Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went onto Amazon.com to look at it.
211	It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would enjoy.
211	FYI: the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.
211	As a matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to DC in August!
211	But, we can wait til Christmas, so go ahead with your plans.
211	Congrats on the furniture.
211	I am sure that you will be happy with it and will love the new look.
211	See ya.
211	Michelle
212	Jane, I am glad that you knew the situation, as I was clueless!
212	Thanks.
212	Michelle
213	FYI; I forgot to cc you!
213	Michelle
214	Brian, THANK YOU for taking a role in the rotation!!
214	Let me know if you need help with the script.
214	Michelle
215	Trey, would you please print this for me at home?
215	Thanks.
215	M
216	Tara, if you didn't know, our phones/computer systems were down for a while.
216	I think Twanda has sent this.
216	Let me know if not.
216	Michelle
217	FYI.
217	Michelle
218	FYI: Tim O'Rourke has developed a new form for PIPs.
219	yes.
220	Dee, I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in. There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor.
220	It is in the preliminary stages, but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if possible.
220	I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward it to Don and me.
220	Let me know if I should be contacting someone else.
220	Thanks a lot!
220	Michelle
221	Enron North America had some summer clerks this summer.
221	Generally, we do not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., someone with lots of Enron experience).
221	I hope that helps.
221	Michelle
222	Twanda, please prepare a consulting agreement.
222	Thanks.
222	Michelle
223	Pam, I spoke with Rex through several voice mails early this week.
223	I have initialed the agreement and sent it to Gene for signature.
223	I expect that it has been signed already.
223	Have a great holiday.
223	Michelle
224	Twanda, what do we need to do with this information?
224	How do we get Emma paid?
224	Michelle
225	Hello!
225	Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.
225	As I mentioned to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.
225	Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the unionized employees.
225	I'll provide details as I learn them.
225	I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.
225	Thanks.
225	Michelle
226	Pat, here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on.
226	Of course, they are going to finalize tomorrow.
226	I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation.
226	Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk?
226	My thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i.
226	claim if it is received.
226	Alternatively, we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party.
226	Any ideas?
226	Michelle
227	Dee/Pat/Rick: Here is the diligence memo.
227	Michelle
228	Amy, Is Patrick Chris Mallory located in Portland or in California?
228	If California, then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes are not enforceable in California.
228	Let me know.
228	(I hope he is in Oregon!) Thanks.
228	Michelle
229	Pat, I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement for Greg Whalley.
229	I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation of value for options/restricted stock.
229	For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my assistant send it under separate email cover.
229	Thanks a lot.
229	Michelle
230	Pat, Thanks for your comments on the agreement.
230	As an FYI, the stock awards already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to address that situation.
230	I appreciate your other thoughts.
230	Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by Pat?
230	Thanks.
230	Michelle
231	Here's the latest.
231	Michelle
232	I agree with Brian.
232	I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, this morning).
232	So, we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system.
232	I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.
232	I agree with Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the chairman and not the content of the email itself.
232	I am happy to assist in any way you would like.
232	Michelle
233	Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.
233	Employees in unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended by the NLRB's ruling.
233	The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be appealed quickly.
233	Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed before responding to that request.
233	We want to be careful to avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice.
233	Thanks.

234	Kristina, Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA voluntarily (although I don't really know why we limit it to voluntary terminations -- I have to look into that).
234	I also will send you by messenger the draft letter to a company (which I don't have on the system) and the letter I sent to the individual we discussed.
234	I hope these help.
234	Let me know if you would like additional information.

237	Amy, It looks like my presence in Portland is iffy at this point.
237	There are other ways to do the training if you still want it asap.
237	Otherwise, I can schedule it a few weeks from now.
237	I'll give you the details as I confirm my situation with the Portland trip.
237	Michelle
238	Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has 45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company to terminate from employment prior to closing.
238	The Seller is providing a limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.
238	The indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those employees.
238	This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc. The indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.
238	Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.
238	I can assist you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.
238	Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.
238	Michelle Cash
239	Dick, Here are the details about the GPG PRC meeting.
239	Please note that these people have not been involved in the process for very long and thus, this may not be the best example of how the process works.
239	Nonetheless, it should give you a flavor of how it works.
239	When you get to the Enron Building, please ask for me or my assistant, Twanda Sweet, and one of us will take you to the conference room.
239	Thanks a lot!
239	Michelle
240	Twanda, could you please print for my review?
240	Thanks a lot!
240	MHC
241	t; please prnt for me thx
242	Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?
242	I would like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.
242	Do you have any information on that?
242	Thanks.
242	Michelle Cash
243	I will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to avoid the conclusion you have reached, which appears to be the correct one.
243	I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon.
243	Michelle
244	FYI, here is information relating to the voice mail I forwarded to you late Friday.
244	I will be on vacation the dates they want to handle diligence, so one of you may need to handle it.
244	Let's see what happens.
244	.
244	.
244	Michelle
245	t: Please print for me.
245	Thanks a lot!
245	Michelle
246	Scott, I would love to attend, except that I will be out of the office on vacation that whole week.
246	It sounds like a great presentation!
246	Would you mind if I forward it to some other folks in corporate legal who might be interested (i.e., my counterparts)?
246	Thanks.
246	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
247	TWanda, I assume that you have these saved somewhere?
247	If not, would you?
247	Thanks.
247	Michelle
248	Hoyt, I suggest that we get Aaron Brown and Sheila Knudsen working on the issue of deferred comp.
248	to work with Dee on this comparison.
248	Thanks.
248	Michelle
249	Debi, I will prepare a draft response for you.
249	Michelle
250	Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.
250	We also hire consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is pretty long for a consultng position.
250	What is the situation?
250	Maybe we can find an alternative.
250	Michelle
251	I agree with your approach.
251	MHC PS, I am out next week on vacation.
251	Call Twanda to arrange for assistance while I am out, and she will refer you on.
251	Agreements will be done during my absence; again, work with Twanda.
251	Thanks.
251	Michelle
252	Here is the note that went out.
252	I'm giving a speech this morning and will be out all afternoon, but I will try to catch you in between.
252	Also, I am in tomorrow, but then am out all next week on vacation.
252	While I am out, you can work with Emma Caplan.
252	Thanks.
252	Michelle
253	Debi, Your plan sounds good to me.
253	You all have done a good job of researching this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.
253	My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them.
253	What is the harm in accepting them?
253	Are we obligated to interview the candidate?
253	Given this situation, it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially since their "proven track record" is only for one placement.
253	It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.
253	Let me know if my assumption is not correct.
253	Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.
253	It certainly is well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing.
253	So, unless you feel compelled, .
253	.
253	.
253	.
253	Thanks.
253	Michelle
254	Thanks for handling that!
254	We are looking forward to our trip.
254	I'll call you when we get in and let you know our details.
254	I look forward to seeing you, Mary Lou, and Peter, if available.
254	See you soon!
254	Michelle
255	Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice Hoyt and Melissa, I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for MG/RW.
255	It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.
255	I am not really familiar with the specific facts here.
255	The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.
255	So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor.
255	Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.
255	If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.
255	It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative).
255	Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers.
255	I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion.
255	So, let's try to discuss it.
255	I am booked until about 11 this morning, but am available after that.
255	Michelle
256	Bret, I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.
256	We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran Mayes of ENA HR will conduct.
256	Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent modeling of benefit costs.
256	We would like to have our outside counsel in Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian or Quebec law.
256	I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide whatever other assistance may be needed.
256	Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for employment/labor matters.
256	I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our outside counsel designee.
256	Michelle
257	would you please print this and attachments and put a sticky note on them that it is for Anonymous Letters project -- so that I focus on it!
257	thanks.
258	Debi, I will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from CS at this time.
258	I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed.
258	That way, we aren't making it an absolute ban.
258	Thanks for the information.
258	Michelle
259	I certainly agree with the concept.
259	It sounds like it gives us more flexibility.
260	Debi, Your response should go as follows.
260	I suggest doing it in writing, rather than an email that could be manipulated.
260	If you have theri fax number, that probably would be best.
260	Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity materials.
260	We prefer to keep our vendor list private.
260	Dear Ms. Poss, Thank you for your written request for a reference on Contracting Solutions.
260	It is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies.
260	I would suggest that you contact another company that does business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.
260	I am sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives.
260	By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me.
260	She indicated that you had identified Contracting Solutions as the subject matter of your request.
260	Sincerely yours, Debi Vanwey
261	Hoyt, I have reviewed the attached.
261	I think it looks good.
261	It strikes the balance of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the future.
261	Kriste, any other thoughts?
261	Michelle
262	I have not prepared one and am not aware of one in place -- that is why I prefaced my comments with that.
262	Randy's email made it sound like there was one.
262	Sorry I'm not more help on this.
262	Michelle
263	Patrick, do you have any comments to this?
263	Michelle
264	I'd suggest finding otu more information.
264	My inclination would be not to accept the contractor.
265	Gina, Have we figured out what happened here?
265	I haven't heard anything in a while.
265	Michelle
266	As you know, we have another power plant project -- if I haven't forwarded information to you yet, I will be doing so in the next day or so.
266	The schedule is for preliminary diligence to be completed by 9/8; data room is open 9/6.
266	Attached to the email I will be sending you is a list of the current information we have here -- lots of documents are here.
266	Please review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied, and I will coordinate that process.
266	The stock purchase agreement draft will be circulated next week.
266	Michelle
267	Sure.
267	Dick is an outside consultant.
267	His name is Dick Jeanerette.
267	His number is 713-650-6535.
267	Thanks, and have fun in MA.
267	Michelle
268	FYI, it sounds like they now are organized about the process in New York.
268	Michelle
269	Andrea, You are right.
269	I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who was setting up the meeting.
269	I apologize for the oversight -- it was not intentional.
269	I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings.
269	I am sorry about this one.
269	Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a compensation system or a feedback system?
269	Because the process tries to address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.) This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system.
269	This tension has given people lots of heartburn.
269	To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees.
269	The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating.
269	For example, a "strong" performer really could be excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third category.
269	For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic.
269	Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old "HR" language.
269	For example, a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like: "Always raises the bar; franchise player," etc. rather than a "HR" definition relating to demonstrating criteria.
269	Also, people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference between the two.
269	There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive.
269	Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process.
269	This was only the first meeting.
269	I will make sure that you are invited to attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.
269	Let me know if you have any questions.
269	Michelle
270	FYI.
270	Michelle
271	David, Hello, I hope all is well with you.
271	I was out last week on holiday and am just now getting back into the swing of things.
271	Alan and I have spoken about your contract, and I am getting in touch with the CU lawyers to work on an appropriate form for Australia.
271	I will be keep you apprised of the status.
271	Have a good weekend.
271	Michelle
272	Privileged and Confidential Felicia, Would you please run a disparate impact analysis for the proposed stock options to be granted within Enron Net Works?
272	I would like this data for the purpose of giving legal advice.
272	Thank you.
272	Michelle
273	I think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense.
273	Obviously, new hire orientation is too late!
273	I prefer an original, signed document, but a fax is an ok substitute, provided that the applicant mails us the originals after faxing.
273	Thanks.
273	MHC
274	I agree.
274	Thanks for letting them know about my contact.
274	I emailed them the form, so we should be on our way!
274	Michelle
275	Gina, I will leave this to your discretion.
275	I agree that the OD&T people could help us in the communication/training side of any changes that are made.
275	Comp.
275	probably will not be affected much, since Needs Improvement and Issues both are no bonus/no merit categories.
275	Thanks.
275	Michelle
276	Hoyt, Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages in exchange for a release.
276	We need the title/position and the age of the persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as well as the persons who were not offered a package.
276	We will provide this data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.
276	Thanks.
276	Michelle
277	Brian, Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.
277	I think he has a good idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.
277	Currently, it is done on an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.
277	Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?
277	It would be an excellent start.
277	Thanks.
277	Michelle
278	Sheryl, sorry, I had the wrong email address.
278	Here is the resend.
278	Michelle
279	I hadn't heard about Alex's offer.
279	That is great!!
279	He is such a nice guy.
279	I'll send details on hen night later.
279	Michelle
280	please print this and attachment for me.
280	thanks.
280	mhc
281	Here are the latest!!!
281	Michelle
282	fyi re: Lutz.
282	mhc
283	Rick, It sounds like this may satisfy CURE, but I question whether this is an appropriate payment.
283	I would want to touch base with the lawyers working on the deal to find out if there are any implications.
283	Any other feedback?
283	Michelle
284	Hoyt -- actually, we need only the New York office -- other locations should not be included.
284	Thanks.
284	Michelle
285	FYI re: Crane.
285	Michelle
286	FYI re: Crane
287	Pat, thanks for the update.
287	By the way, did you talk with Fran Mayes, who went to the management presentations last week?
287	She may have some of the missing information.
287	Dee, you might want to check with her for data.
287	Thanks.
287	Michelle
288	Hello, girls.
288	If Stacey can do it, so can I!
288	Here are the latest pictures of Cameron.
288	These were taken right before the Baptism of my sister's third (can you believe it??) child, so he is all dressed up.
288	I hope all is well with everyone.
288	Love, Michelle
289	Andrea, Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.
289	It seems as if it should come from your group and go out globally.
289	What do you think?
289	Michelle
290	Hoyt, Here is a privileged and confidential legal memorandum regarding the Garden State modification of operations.
290	Let's discuss these issues tomorrow or Friday.
290	Michelle
291	Please see the note below, which was forwarded to me by Richard Sanders, on Triple Lutz.
291	Michelle
292	CPage: Would you please forward this directly to Pat?
292	Pat, For your information, Chris Tomko has resigned from GSP.
292	GSP has hired a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR person.
292	I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling in the next few weeks as this transition occurs.
292	If you are available on Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt.
292	Would you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know your availability so that she can set up a conference call?
292	Thanks a lot.
292	Twanda, would you please set this up when Pat calls?
292	Michelle
293	great, Andrea, shall we discuss rollout asap?
293	Thanks!!
293	Michelle
294	Roberto, These are good questions, and, in fact, are ones to which I am not certain of the answer (at least for #2).
294	Let's get together next week to discuss the specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues.
294	Twanda, would you please set up this meeting for me?
294	Thanks.
294	Michelle
295	Bob, there also are legal issues to address, so I appreciate your keeping me in the loop as this evolves.
295	Thanks.
295	Michelle
296	Chuck, Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?
296	Given the correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.
296	Otherwise, even if we do "agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.
296	I am ready to hear what this guy has to say about my client.
296	Let me know your thoughts.
296	Thanks.
296	Michelle
297	Drew, You are right on.
297	I do have the concerns raised in your prior email, but I did not want to commit those to writing.
297	I have asked to be kept in the loop, and will provide that input as needed in a meeting setting.
297	Thanks.
297	Michelle
298	Ginger, I cannot attend that meeting, as I am in another.
298	I will be out of the office the rest of the week, so check with Twanda Sweet, my assistant, for rescheduling options.
298	Thanks.
298	Michelle
299	Mary, yes, it merely is a form issue.
299	Sharon and Kriste have consolidated those paragraphs in their form.
299	I will follow suit in mine to minimize confusion and to keep the "one template" concept intact.
299	Michelle
300	I also want to be included in this discussion, but I do not want to commit my thoughts to writing.
300	So, count me in. Michelle Enron North America Corp.
301	Andrea, I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.
301	However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our sessions.
301	It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of that meeting.
301	I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.
301	It looks like our action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an extension because of my travel).
301	In the meantime, you can meet with David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.
301	Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me.
301	(I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).
301	What do you think?
301	Michelle PS, do we need to include Don in our group?
302	TWanda, please print for me, including attachments.
302	Thanks.
302	Michelle
303	Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.
303	We also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy and the Code of Ethics provisions on data should be referenced, with a link, if possible.
303	Thanks.
303	Michelle
304	Mary, I won't be able to call her until next week because I'm going to be out/tied up the rest of this week.
304	I am fine if you want to call her.
304	My only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure -- not why we set it up the way we did or anything else that would be privileged and confidential.
304	The structure itself would not be privileged -- only our strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be.
304	If you don't mind a delay in the return call, I'll do it next week.
304	Just let me know.
304	Thanks.
304	Michelle
305	I would suggest working through Sheila Knudsen and the Compensation Council to get this done Enron-wide.
305	Let me know if that isn't successful.
305	Thanks.
305	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
306	No, just hold on -- we're waiting for final settlement documents from Reliant, with the Ajello release.
306	Michelle
307	please print for me as well as attachemnts.
307	thanks.
307	mhc
308	tweanda, please print this and save as a form.
308	Then, put the print out in the Merger, Acquisition, and Divestitures Notebook on myu credenza-- just stick it inside there.
308	Thanks.
308	MHc
309	Amy, this looks fine, except I would delete the provision about exceptions, because there really are none!
309	Thanks.
309	Michelle
310	Here are comments from Tom Moore regarding the proposed Services Agreement.
310	I will circulate the draft SSD this week.
310	As always, I welcome additional feedback from the user groups.
310	Michelle
311	Kay, 10/10 works for me at 4:00.
311	If that date doesn't work, would you please include my assistant, Twanda Sweet, on the distribution, given that I will be out at the law conference for the rest of the day and tomorrow?
311	Thanks.
311	Michelle
312	Gerry, this is too cryptic for me -- what was decided?
312	I'd like to go to the next meeting!
312	Thanks.
312	Michelle
313	David, I will have this re-reviewed by Oregon counsel, but it was scrubbed about 18-24 months ago as being enforceable.
313	Thanks.
313	Michelle
314	Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on Williams.
314	I hope that happened .
314	.
314	.
314	I would like to have a petition ready early next week.
314	It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.
314	I believe Ajello will be finalized this week.
314	I sent our signed version to Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon.
314	Once that happens, we can dismiss.
314	Thanks.
314	Michelle
315	Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate.
315	"Met" expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in Satisfactory.
315	Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would be more accurate.
315	Where are we on the total revamp?
315	Has that been postponed until next year?
315	Thanks.
315	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
316	Davie -- Meets many, but may have some developmen needs works just fine.
316	I just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets requirements when, in fact, there are developmental needs that are obvious when compared to persons in strong.
316	So, I am happy with your proposal (although I suggest that your second proposal does not meet the "fairly up" goal).
316	Cheers.
316	Mich
317	I have sent a mark-up of this to Dave.
317	Let's talk tomorrow around 10:00.
317	Michelle
318	FYI -- Michelle
319	Here are the schedules.

320	Do we have a rule against heaters?
320	If not, that seems to be the easiest solution, as well as the "dress warm" advice.
320	I think that moving him would not be good -- his isolation could work against our goals here.
320	Your thoughts?
320	Michelle
321	thanks, I look forward to your thoughts and comments.
321	michelle
322	Steve, I hope that I did not educate her too well .
322	.
322	.
322	It was great to see you, and be sure to let me know if you can use my help in the future.
322	Michelle
323	I'm here til 3:30, when meetings begin.
323	.
323	.
323	thanks!
323	mhc Enron North America Corp.
324	Kay, I will be out attending a seminar -- but, don't hold it up for me.
324	Thanks!
324	Michelle
325	All is fine -- no disparate impact in the selection.
325	But, I still would like to see data about why certain persons were selected.
325	Thanks.
325	Michelle
326	Ben, there should be a standard form for this -- check with Candace.
326	If not, let me know.
326	Michelle
327	Cathy, what do we want to do with regard to Paskoff?
327	Remember, we were waiting until this week to respond to his requests for additional consideration?
327	Please let me know.
327	Thanks.
327	Michelle
328	Cathy, Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as well as their title and age.
328	Please make sure that happens, or our waivers will not be valid.
328	Thanks.
328	Michelle
329	FYI.
329	Also, I never heard back from Ilya's lawyer.
329	Did he sign?
329	Thanks.
329	Michelle
330	Jim, FYI.
330	The second link here is about workers' comp insurance in California.
330	Michelle
331	Clark, Thank you; I received this and will look over your comments.
331	If I have any questions, I'll give you a call.
331	I appreciate being included.
331	Michelle
332	Cathy, let's talk about the outstanding issues on Monday so that we can wrap these up.
332	Thanks.
332	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
333	Dave, Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?
333	The reason I ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.
333	I'd just as soon we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be replaced.
333	Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.
333	Thanks.
333	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
334	No, I have not sent any information.
334	I doubt that Hoyt has, either.
334	You send them the information before they sign.
334	I would just do a cover memo and references the agreement, where there is a specific provision about receipt of information.
334	Thanks.
334	MHC Enron North America Corp.
335	What about Paskoff?
335	His lawyer is calling me.
335	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
336	Twanda, would you please schedule a meeting with me, Hector, Sheila W., and Brian Schaffer re: follow up to the Bashen information?
336	I would like to have this group discuss how to close the loop with Sally's employees and implement any recommendations for follow-up.
336	I think the meeting with last approximately 1 1/2 hours.
336	Thanks.
336	Michelle
337	Please print this and save it to my document list.
337	Thanks.
337	Michelle
338	I agree with your assessment.
338	Thanks.
338	michelle
339	sounds fine to me.
339	Michelle
340	those look good.
340	Has Sheng already signed?
340	Let me know.
340	Also, we need an answer on Paskoff; his lawyer called again.
340	Thanks.
340	MHC Enron North America Corp.
341	I suggest contacting Peggy Banzak for a contact in Mexico.
341	Michelle
342	Dave, why don't you send it to Steve for review.
342	The consultant doing the training will be working from this.
342	When do we want to set up the training?
342	Our lawyers are ready to go.
342	Thanks.
342	Michelle
343	Anne, I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.
343	From my perspective, it generally looks fine.
343	I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.
343	In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.
343	I believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds $250K.
343	We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of Section 4.13(iii).
343	Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law.
343	However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing.
343	This may be done with the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.
343	Section 6.2(e) contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.
343	In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any employment contracts.
343	We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, and the contracts of key personnel may expire.
343	Do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?
343	Section 6.2(l) also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.
343	In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws.
343	Rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.
343	In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind to customers.
343	I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and provide Enron goodies to people all the time.
343	Perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate.
343	Also, a reference to our Code of Ethics may work here.
343	In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, or does it include equity grants that vest over time?
343	A reference to "cash" payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock options/restricted stock that vest over time.
343	In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting -- Pat, do you know?
343	Should Section 7.3 be italicized?
343	I have not seen the latest of the Employee Matters Agreement.
343	Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the purposes of dispute resolution?
343	Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions.
343	Michelle
344	Pat, I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate email.
344	I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.
344	In terms of timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!
344	Thanks a lot!
344	Michelle
345	Here is a set of comments by Pat Mackin on the Triple Lutz agreement.
345	Cynthia/Mary, do you have anything to add?
345	Michelle
346	please excuse the delay on this -- If possible, I would like the following documents copied from the data room: Woodland: Tab No.'s 107-130, and 136 Brunswick: Tab No.'s 102-127, and 137 Thanks.
346	Michelle Cash
347	One other item: Could you please request all employment contracts and change of control agreements, if any?
347	Thank you.
347	Michelle
348	Karen, does Sean have his art on a web site anywhere?
348	I have someone who wants to look at it.
348	Michelle
349	Andrea, This looks good.
349	I have two nits: First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1.
349	Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.
349	One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no filter on what employees can/can't put.
349	In other words, if an employee is working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.
349	One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron facility -- not remotely.
349	This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.
349	Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.
349	Thanks.
349	Michelle
350	Drew, Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who has had some issues.
350	I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement.
350	I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning?
350	713-218-7355 is the fax number.
350	If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I will prepare on this topic.
350	I am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.
350	I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and Louise for comment and dart-throwing.
350	I can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 713-302-5522.
350	Thanks, Drew.
350	Michelle
351	Here is the attachment.
351	Thanks for the update on Delainey.
351	Michelle
352	Drew, thanks, I got it.
352	I'll be sending out an email on this in the next couple of hours.
352	I'll send it to you and Robert first.
352	You can run it by Chapman and/or outside counsel in London today.
352	If everyone is in agreement as to the approach, we can send it to Louise asap.
352	More to come .
352	.
352	.
352	.
352	Michelle
353	fyi.
353	Michelle
354	Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this.
354	I have a vague recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information.
354	She was involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?
354	Then, we can discuss a strategy.
354	Thanks.
354	Michelle
355	David, I believe the agreement was signed.
355	It would have been a Corporate Services Agreement.
355	I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on this.
355	I have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version.
355	Thanks.
355	Michelle Enron Capital Management
356	Here is the latest.
356	Michelle
357	FYI, particularly the part about the performance management system.
357	Let's see what kind of data we can get about the Microsoft evaluation system to find the differences.
357	Thanks.
357	Michelle
358	Would you let me know which you choose?
358	I may need some of them as a backup!
358	Michelle
359	I have a copy of the signed Employee Services Agreement between Bridgeline and ENA.
359	Would you like a copy of it?
359	Michelle Enron Capital Management
360	Sure, I'll send letters.
360	The one for Paskoff will go out today.
360	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
361	Amy, this is way late, so sorry.
361	I suggest running it by the HR leadership team.
361	The email list can be obtained from Gerry Gibson at corp.
361	If there are HR openings, and she would be interested, they would most probably be the best people to assess her skills.
361	Thanks.
361	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
362	Nathan, Ted Bland is the Enron wholesale person responsible for all recruiting for one of the business units I support.
362	I actually spoke with Ted today about you.
362	He is working on scheduling you for a meeting, but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules.
362	So, there is no need to follow up, because he will get with you in a few days.
362	Hope all is well.
362	Michelle
363	please print this and attachments.
363	Thanks.
363	MHC
364	Dee, I assume that you will go through these documents for benefits/plan issues and then send relevant ones to Pat this week.
364	If that is not your plan, let me know.
364	Thanks!
364	Michelle
365	Craig, I spoke with Fran Mayes about being the HR person for the Leaf River site visit, and she is planning to go.
365	Michelle
366	Anne, Would you please re-send me the Employee Matters Agreement for Lutz?
366	I have deleted my electronic copy and need to send it on to the HR people.
366	Thanks.
366	Michelle
367	My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline deal.
367	In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the Bridgeline entity.
367	It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the employees are sent there via an assignment letter.
367	(Pat, you may recall that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have given you the transaction name at the time).
367	So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron employees.
367	I am not aware of any change to that structure.
367	Fran, do you know of any changes?
367	Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to the Bridgeline entity?
367	Those answers would help.
367	Michelle
368	Here is the agreement for Lutz.
368	Michelle
369	Andrea, would it be possible to update our list to show the current progress on the "30 days" items?
369	I think you have a better handle on the timelines than I would.
369	Thanks.
369	Michelle
370	Marty, Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.
370	As we discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.
370	So, I told her to call you.
370	The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.
370	His number is 713-652-4748.
370	Thanks.
370	Michelle
371	I am not at all surprised!!!!
371	Michelle
372	Here is pricing information about harassment prevention training.
372	Feel free to call Kerry directly about his availability.
372	Michelle
373	David, I am in agreement with you on this.
373	This week, we lost an agreement that had options to be granted.
373	It did not make it to the Administrative Committee until 2 months after signing, and only because the employee came forward and asked about her grant.
373	Luckily for us, the strike price was better/lower.
373	If it had been the other way around, we may have had a much bigger issue.
373	Michelle
374	Yes, thanks.
374	I was aware of that joyous news.
374	I am going to see if I can get a copy of the petition to review all the allegations in detail.
374	Thanks.
374	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
375	How about this: Any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards; the use of the term "guaranteed" on this worksheet does not modify the terms and conditions of any such payment/grant.
375	Too wordy?
375	Michelle
376	Thanks.
376	What about the COBRA amounts?
376	Are they correct?
376	I will be glad to close this one out, too!
376	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
377	hi, Trang, I would like to have a little more information about this.
377	Who is she sending emails to?
377	When were they sent?
377	Have all the bills been paid?
377	etc. Thanks.
377	Michelle
378	please save as a form and print for me.
378	I'll revise then.
378	Thanks.
378	Michelle
379	Pat, Here is the latest PSA draft for a We've agreed to pay $1mm of the severance.
379	We also have agreed to pay the cost of 2000 bonuses.
379	On options, there is a proposal for Enron to supervest the employees' options at closing -- can we agree to that?
379	I didn't think so.
379	your comments would be appreciated.
379	Michelle
380	Pat, Hello!
380	I am sending to you a memo from Stuart Zisman here at Enron.
380	He has a question that I am forwarding to you, since I don't know the answer.
380	Would you please give him an answer today, if possible?
380	Thanks a lot!
380	Michelle
381	Fran, I think we should get together tomorrow to discuss the issues around this deal.
381	Could you get with Twanda to do that?
381	THanks.
381	MIchelle
382	FYI.
382	Michelle
383	Dave, I left you a voice mail that I am available to assist in this process at your convenience.
383	Let me know how you want to proceed.
383	Michelle Enron Capital Management
384	Sorry about the earlier email!
384	The following contains a summary of high-level employment/labor issues based upon the review of the documents in the data room here in Houston.
384	We still need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the climate of labor relations and other employment issues.
384	Woodland 1.
384	Employment Claims: In the list of insurance matters, there are several employment-related claims.
384	Those include sexual harassment allegations, disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.
384	It is unclear whether those are ongoing claims or not.
384	I would question whether the mill has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.
384	Also, are there other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?
384	2.
384	Labor Union matters: Rick Johnson is going to review the collective bargaining agreements.
384	I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is supposed to be forwarded to me today.
384	3.
384	I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing for either Woodland.
384	Leaf River 1.
384	Litigation Summary: The company provided a summary of litigation.
384	Three of the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a delivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled 7/27/00).
384	The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.
384	The summary states that the corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.
384	We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this transaction.
384	Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?
384	(E.g., EEOC).
384	2.
384	No employment contracts.
384	I saw nothing about change of control agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide post-closing payments.
384	3.
384	Workers Comp: There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998.
384	I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make sure that they are not unusual.
384	Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should provide a separate analysis on that topic.
384	Michelle
385	Laura, do you need any more information from me on this point?
385	Michelle
386	David, The "gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term. I will make your tweak to 3.4. I checked the 12-months with Clayton Utz, and they thought it was ok. I'll forward a new draft in the next day or so. Hope you had a good trip back.
387	Should that be 2 months or 3 months?
387	we haven't done less than three, and I don't think it is a good idea to go below that.
387	MHC
388	Felicia, Does this sound right to you?
388	Just wanted to confirm.
388	Thanks.
388	Michelle
389	Pat, thanks for your comments.
389	I agree 100%.
389	Michelle PS.
389	My friend who is a photographer is doing a show in Dallas this week.
389	I suspect that we'll see info on his web site pretty soon.
390	Tim, I just got your letter about the January trial setting.
390	When did we learn of that setting?
390	How do we accomplish the goal of keeping our business people free from depositions at year-end?
390	Can that be done?
390	Michelle
391	Dee, could you please forward to Steve Van Hooser our usual checklist on employee matters for diligence purposes?
391	That would be helpful.
391	Thanks.
391	Michelle
392	Anne, I got you an invitation to the Preview Party for Wednesday!
392	Eden Sholeen is going to call you with the details.
392	Michelle
393	Felicia, This is a merchant asset, which we currently own 100%, but plan to sell down in the coming months.
393	It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron -- they do not participate in Enron benefits, and we are working hard to prevent any claims that we could be a joint employer with it.
393	Thoughts?
393	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
394	Kathy, I think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement.
394	It does not have to be as long and involved as our current ones, but we should paper it up.
394	Michelle
395	Cheryl, I am taking 12/1 off as a vacation day -- so, let's play!!!
395	I have a hair appointment Saturday, which I cannot really change this late in the year.
395	So, do you want to get a haircut, manicure, or anything else beautifying while you are here?
395	If so, I'll book something for you.
395	There is no way we would have you babysit.
395	In fact, we have a sitter for Saturday night.
395	so we can go somewhere fun for dinner and maybe even see a movie or do anything else you may want to do.
395	I can't wait for your visit!!
395	Michelle
396	Dear Gerald, I received and reviewed your email, and I will check with my clients on your proposal.
396	I expect that I will have an answer later this week.
396	I understand that my assistant has sent you the documents by email.
396	Let me know if you did not receive them.
396	Feel free to give me a call to discuss.
396	Michelle Cash
397	Cindy, Tim, Marly, Pam, and Neil -- I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this weekend.
397	How about 6:30 am on Saturday?
397	After that, you can schedule it at your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks.
397	I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don't worry, I only have 5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey's shirts to be ironed.
397	That shouldn't take too long.
397	See you then.
397	Michelle
398	Go ahead and file it.
398	Thanks.
398	Michelle
399	On lunch, I've asked Twanda to reschedule.
399	thanks.
399	mhc
400	for your entertainment.
400	mhc
401	Hector, I met with David Baumbaugh today about Bridgeline.
401	Apparently, we have sent Trey Logan over there to replace O'Neal Winfree.
401	We thus need to do an assignment letter for Logan.
401	Could you please provide me and Twanda with the particulars so that we can paper it up?
401	Thanks.
401	Michelle
402	Here is the latest piece of information.
402	Michelle
403	Looks good to me.
403	MHC
404	Yes, we will reword it.
404	In fact, we are looking at a review of the entire application.
404	Michelle
405	Any interest in either of these candidates?
405	They are presented by a headhunter.
405	Let me know.
405	Michelle
406	Janie, Has Peggy been hired yet?
406	If not, would you please forward me her resume again?
406	Thanks.
406	Michelle
407	Fran, any word from Nancy?
407	Thanks.
407	Michelle
408	Bill, I'll be in tomorrow; let's discuss this matter.
408	Thanks.
408	Michelle
409	For AMPS: Here are the HR questions for diligence.
409	Michelle
410	Hector -- we do not know the details of how this will work.
410	It has not been finally decided.
410	I would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing until the deal, if it happens, is signed.
410	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
411	You should have it.
411	I sent it yesterday.
411	Michelle Twanda, could you confirm?
411	Thanks.
411	MHC
412	fyi.
412	Does this give you enough information?
412	MHC
413	Dan, here is info on AMPS.
413	Some of these points should be included in deal documents.
413	Michelle
414	Dorie, I think this looks good.
414	I have two tweaks: On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I'd delete the "let me be clear" introduction.
414	I think the last sentence speaks for itself.
414	In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay, "we will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the reference to attorneys.
414	Let me know if you have any questions.
414	Otherwise, it is good to go.
414	Good luck!
414	Michelle
415	This is great!!!!
415	Can you believe all that is going on in Sunny Florida?
415	I called Nat/Laura to get their take on the mayhem, but I haven't been able to talk with them.
415	I got a voice mail from Laura that Jesse Jackson was leading a demonstration up the street from their house!
415	They are right in the thick of it.
415	Later.
415	MHC
416	I thought you might get a kick out of this.
416	Michelle
417	I'll call you tomorrow.
417	Michelle
418	I'll take care of it today.
418	Michelle
419	Tim, Do you think these depositions will take a day apiece?
419	Or, can we schedule more than one in a day?
419	Let me know, so that I can arrange schedules.
419	Thanks for the update!
419	Good work.
419	Michelle
420	FYI re: California law.
420	Michelle
421	Hoyt, If GSP LLC would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it risk bringing them back for light duty work?
421	Why not wait until they are fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers comp scheme?
421	Also, Hoyt, you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc'd someone from Media General in the prior email.
421	We don't want to waive any privileges.
421	Michelle
422	Trey, The following items are on my Christmas list: 1.
422	Boggle game 2.
422	Joe Jackson CD: Night & Day II 3.
422	Pottery Barn Large Organizer: Catalogue number 48-2806305 ($69) 4.
422	Monnogrammed Travel Alarm Clock (Pottery Barn) Catalogue # 10-2811784 5.
422	Monogrammed Business Card Holder (Pottery Barn) Item # 12-33756186 ($30) 6.
422	Hermes or Hermes-type scarf 7.
422	Wood picture frames -- painted black is ok -- for 5x7 prints 8.
422	Drink coasters Let me know if you have any questions or want more specific information.
422	Michelle
423	Attached is the resume of Dominic Carolan, who currently is working at Global E&P.
423	He is looking to move elsewhere within Enron, given that the assets in Global E&P are going to be sold.
423	I understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience.
423	He might be a good candidate.
423	I met him today, and he is pleasant and professional.
423	If you are interested in interviewing him, let me know, and I will get it scheduled.
423	Thanks.
423	Michelle
424	David, I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we are not dealing with Bidder D. I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).
424	We probably can schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 60 days' notice.
424	Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.
424	I'd prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer.
424	I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere with" the offers made by the buyer.
424	Does that mean no counteroffers?
424	To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.
424	It is easier to commit only the wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc. whether they will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, if possible.
424	We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have been involved in this transaction.
424	Let me know if you have any questions.
424	Michelle
425	Julia, On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents?
425	Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and initialling them before signature.
425	Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may be a desire to have a more expeditious process.
425	I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department is going to be involved in GSP work.
425	Given our discussion last week, I would not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the standard Enron process, but it is not my call.
425	I would appreciate your thoughts.
425	Michelle
426	Charles, if this is for London, then we generally ask Jon Chapman (attorney over there) to review things.
426	Let me know if that is the case.
426	Michelle
427	Gracie, Based upon my brief review of her comments, many are not acceptable.
427	Without a convincing explanation, I am not going to delete entire sections of our agreement, particularly when those sections protect Enron.
427	Please get with her (not by copy of this privileged email) and ask for reasons why she wants the changes.
427	Thanks.
427	Michelle
428	I wasn't sure you'd know who sent it, but good guess!
428	Trey was quite pleased with himself.
428	Later.
428	Michelle
429	Felicia, I am going to take a vacation day on Friday.
429	How about Thursday or Monday?
429	Twanda, ignore my earlier email.
429	Michelle
430	Thanks.
430	I frequently pick up my first job after I complete my second shift at home.
430	That's why I got the nifty flat screen for my computer -- jealous??
430	Michelle
431	Dan, what is the status of this deal?
431	I hadn't heard anything for a few days, and I knew we were on a tight time frame.
431	Thanks.
431	Michelle
432	Please ask Kristen Walsh if they can find him in Dallas.
432	Then, let's re-send it.
432	Thanks.
432	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
433	Was Clonch deposed?
433	What did he say?
433	Michelle
434	Hello, everyone.
434	Please let me know which of these dates works best for you.
434	It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for both preparation and the deposition itself.
434	That way, I can find overlapping dates on which you all are available.
434	Thanks a lot.
434	Michelle
435	Thanks, Dan.
435	We will work to accommodate your schedule.
436	Thanks, Felicia.
436	The same information appeared in today's DLR.
436	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
437	Peter, I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized workforce.
437	I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a deadline of 12/15.
437	Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.
437	You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there are employees and unions from my clients in HR.
437	That makes me and the legal department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service for Enron.
437	Please provide me with information about this deal asap.
437	And, I repeat my request to get me involved earlier on future deals.
437	Thank you.
437	Michelle
438	Thanks for the info.
438	I just need simple, basic frames.
438	No decorations or anything.
438	That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc. So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best.
438	I could use 5x7" the most. Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine. Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it. I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others. We are looking forward to your visit. Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th. Do you and Marianne want to go? I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested. Let me know. See you later. Michelle
439	Here are details on one search firm for legal.
439	thanks.
439	mhc
440	Kathy, here is Ann Park's due diligence template for Canada, which should be of use in Project Canary.
440	Michelle
441	Tim, was it accepted by the court?
441	Michelle
442	I've asked them for dates, and I've got them from 2 of them.
442	Let me bug them again early next week.
442	Tell him to chill out -- his client's deposition has been scheduled and rescheduled too many times to count.
443	Jim, Thanks for trying to call.
443	I am not surprised by this outcome.
443	I guess wer're bargaining!
443	Michelle
444	Thanks for the info.
444	I think that makes it worse!
444	Michelle
445	Rick, FYI.
445	Also, there is a status meeting at 10:00 today -- I don't know if you got message, but I hope you can participate by phone.
445	Michelle
446	He and I are meeting this week to discuss opportunities.
446	I'll keep you posted.
446	Michelle
447	12/18 is ok, not the 19th.
448	I am available at 3:00 Wednesday.
448	I agree that we should convene and discuss.
448	I would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge, but we can keep our fingers crossed.
448	If we don't, then we could discuss strategy for negotiations.
448	Thanks.
448	Michelle
449	Mark, If this hasn't already taken place, I'd like to participate.
449	My assistant, Twanda Sweet, should have my calendar.
449	Also, FYI, Rick JOhnson will be in town at the end of the week if you want a face-to-face.
449	MHC

450	Michelle
451	Cheryl, Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.
451	I had a blast with you being here.
451	I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.
451	I still have the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).
451	Cameron perked right up after the antibiotics kicked in. He is his usual self today (happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend -- you really saw him at his worst, unfortunately).
451	We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.
451	I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the rough time here last weekend.
451	When we're not sick, we're really much more fun!!
451	Besides, the pig races await.
451	gotta go.
451	Michelle
452	Molly, my meeting with Carlos is at 3:30 on Friday.
452	Thanks.
452	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
453	Dee, what do you think?
453	I suggest that we let them handle that, but defer to your opinion.
453	Thanks.
453	Michelle
454	Here are others who want to interview Carlos.
454	I tell you what -- before you schedule any of these, let me talk with Carlos first to see where his interests lie.
454	Keep these names, and I'll keep you posted on who to schedule with him.
454	Thanks.
454	Michelle
455	Alan, he's out of town until Friday, so I will schedule early next week with you and Dan.
455	Others are interested as well, so we'll probably have a full interview schedule with him.
455	Thanks for the quick response.
455	Michelle
456	David, I did not receive the package in interoffice mail.
456	Could you email it to me or re-send it by fax at 646-3490?
456	Thanks!
456	Michelle Enron Capital Management
457	Thanks, I'll be there.
457	Michelle
458	Molly, add her to the list for Carlos.
458	Also, could you find out who Bonnie Nelson has worked for in the past and provide me with that information so that we can call and make reference checks?
458	Thanks a lot.
458	Michelle
459	no, hold all of them until I speak with him -- we've obviously got a lot of interest!
459	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
460	Alice, for the employee we discussed last week, here is information on payee.
460	It doesn't look good.
460	Michelle
461	I'll interview.
461	I'm available between 10-12 on Thursday.
461	Let me know when and where.
461	Michelle
462	FYI.
462	Michelle
463	For your information.
463	Michelle
464	Cathy, Do we have an answer on Cirino?
464	Thanks.
464	Michelle
465	Finley, Can we schedule a conference call with the HR folks at Celgar?
465	Thanks.
465	Michelle
466	I haven't heard anything from Alice yet.
466	MHC
467	What about payrolling through an agency so that he is on a contract-to-hire basis?
467	That way, we can say that the intent is to hire, but that we are evaluating the situation before making a regular, full-time offer.
467	Customers understand contract-to-hire concept, so it may not raise "lack of commitment" jitters.
467	What do you think?
467	Michelle
468	More re Canary
469	more .
469	.
469	.
469	I've forwarded this issue to Dee.
469	MHC
470	FYI re: outside counsel in B.C.
470	who are handling diligence.
470	I spoke with Dean today, and he appeared to be asking all the right questions.
470	MHC
471	Molly, could you please forward the "thanks, but no thanks" template letter to me?
471	I will send it to her since she interviewed.
471	For persons who don't interview, I think the "no thanks" letter can come from HR.
471	Thanks for your assistance on this.
471	Michelle
472	Elizabeth, any interest in the second resume here?
472	We are interviewing the first guy already.
472	Thanks.
472	Michelle
473	please print this plus attachments and file in Garden State file.
473	Thanks.
473	MHC
474	Dianne, Thanks for all your work for the Travel Club.
474	I never make a meeting, but really enjoy the tickets, etc. One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with Disney.
474	Are we a corporate client of Disney?
474	My old law firm had some sort of relationship with Disney that let us get great deals, early entry into the parks, etc., so it may be worth looking into.
474	Thanks again.
474	Michelle Cash
475	please print this and attached and put in the Project Canary Due Diligence file.
475	Thanks.
475	Michelle
476	FYI.
476	Michelle
477	maybe.
477	He was in today and met with Mark Taylor, Travis, and Lance, to positive results.
477	I certainly could ask him if he's interested in trading.
477	Leslie Hansen thinks highly of him.
477	Michelle
478	looks good to me.
478	Thanks!
478	Michelle
479	Hello!
479	An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.
479	There have been three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.
479	The topic is technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.
479	In this 4th edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own time.
479	However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book.
479	She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary information, however.
479	What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?
479	She is willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not think that would be worthwhile.
479	My opinion at this point is that she can do it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific information.
479	I welcome your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.
479	Thanks for your thoughts.
479	Michelle
480	Sure, Twanda, would you please forward?
480	Thanks!
480	Michelle
481	Thank you!!
481	Michelle
482	sounds fabulous!!!
482	See you Friday -- is a place/time confirmed yet?
483	please calendar.
483	thanks.
483	mhc
484	Sure, you could ask.
484	I think that Kriste's draft was prepared before my draft, which I sent to Rosen in executable form.
484	Britt, by copy of this email, I'll ask Twanda to send you the copies from my file here.
484	Thanks for the update.
484	Michelle
485	Shanna, we certainly can hire and manage him out if the performance is not there.
485	Do we not think he'll be a good performer?
485	Michelle
486	Peter, here are preliminary comments from Pat Mackin on the PSA.
486	Michelle
487	Mark, The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that people are being paid equitably.
487	Given that the company has until November of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.
487	A list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to determine whether an issue even exists.
487	Michelle
488	please calendar for me.
488	Thanks!!
488	You also should attend if you are interested.
488	Michelle
489	More info about Bond.
489	Michelle
490	Have him interview with Dan Rogers, Alan Aronowitz, Barbara Gray, and ask them who else they would like to have talk with him.
490	Thanks.
490	Michelle Enron North America Corp.
491	please preparre a "no thanks" letter to this person.
491	Thanks.
491	Michelle
492	David, The document you gave me is the form assignment letter that I have prepared for many Bridgeline personnel.
492	Do we need to do anything to tweak it?
492	How do you want me to proceed?
492	Thanks.
492	Michelle Enron Capital Management
493	please save, run spell check, and print for my review.
493	I think that Robert Jones or Oxley will have to sign it instead of me, since I am not an officer.
493	Thanks.
493	MHCC
494	Add Tweed to the persons to interview Carlos Sole.
494	Thanks.
494	MHC
495	Sheila, HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week, and you will be on the interviewer list.
495	Thanks!
495	How would you like references run on Bonnie?
495	Internally or pre-Enron.
495	Let me know, since this is the first time I have received that request (given that I am new in this role!).
495	Thanks.
495	Michelle
496	Barbara, HR should be contacting you about interviewing him next week..
496	A number of folks are interested in Carlos!
496	Thanks for the response.
496	Michelle
497	Mark, as an update, I am meeting with Carlos tomorrow.
497	He will interview with a number of folks next week, including Sheila, Barbara, Alan, and Dan (all of whom expressed an interest in talking with him about working in their groups).
497	Assuming all goes well, I'll schedule a meeting with you after that.
497	Michelle
498	Fran, What was the resolution of the payments to the LRC people?
498	Michelle
499	Thanks!
499	Michelle
500	Will do, sorry you're working so late!
501	Gene, sorry I didn't cc you on this.
501	Here is the info.
501	Have a great weekend!
501	Michelle
502	What is the answer?
502	Michelle
503	Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation.
503	I would like to clarify one thing: at this point, I don't know for sure if we are having law students work with us during the summer.
503	Why don't you check with me in April or May to see whether we are hiring summer associates.
503	If so, you are welcome to go through the interview process.
503	Thanks.
503	Michelle
504	Let me know if you would have any interest in talking with this candidate.
504	Michelle
505	thanks for organizing this!
505	It was a blast.
505	See you Sunday.
505	Michelle
506	Dan, I have been working with James McMillan on the LNG project in Venezuela.
506	I would like to have some additional information about structure, project company, etc., and figured you would know where I could obtain that information.
506	Thanks.
506	Michelle
507	please print this plus attached in color.
507	Thanks.
507	Michelle
508	please do a consulting agreeement with this group.
508	Michelle
509	could you please forward to Scott Miller (email below) our short confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-compete agreement?
509	Thanks a lot.
509	Michelle
510	Never mind about the scarf -- My mother got one for him.
510	Michelle
511	Dean, to whom did you send the package last week?
512	Dean, do you have any information to respond to the highlighted portions?
512	Thanks!
512	Michelle
513	Sharon, Mark has said he sees no problem with this.
513	Do you have any thoughts?
513	Michelle
514	Is this for Diane?
514	Thanks.
514	Michelle
515	sounds good.
515	I do plan to attend if you have a meeting!
515	MHC
516	I was trying to lowball it!
516	Michelle
517	I understand that Nigel is working this one.
517	MHC
518	Eden, Here is the data for the Ecogas settlement agreements.
518	Michelle
519	please handle for me.
519	thanks.
519	mhc
520	please handle.
520	thanks.
520	mhc
521	please handle for me.
521	thanks.
521	mhc
522	please handle for me.
522	thanks.
522	mhc
523	I haven't heard anything, but I would suggest that you have them stand down for the meantime.
523	Michelle
524	Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.
524	MHC
525	Hello, everyone.
525	No need to work on Canary any more -- it is off.
525	I would suggest that you save your work in the event that it is revived, but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon.
525	Michelle
526	My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses.
526	Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and explanations.
526	Perhaps we will work together again in the future.
526	Michelle
527	go ahead and initial it.
527	I assume that there are no changes.
527	Michelle
528	Candace, You are right -- there is no need to send a second letter since we didn't base our decision on the background check results.
528	Michelle
529	I don't do EBS, but I have asked Kriste Sullivan to send me the info you requested.
529	You also may want to check with Shelly Pierce in EBS compensation to see what she knows.
529	Michelle
530	Roberto, If a person is accessing inappropriate web sites in the course of investigations, it does not violate the policies.
530	However, it may be useful to set up protocols or logs to confirm when a person is accessing it for investigative purposes to remove all confusion on the matter.
530	Michelle
531	Molly, Let's schedule interviews with Bechel with Mark Haedicke, Elizabeth Sager, Sheila Tweed, Dan Lyons, and Lisa Mellencamp.
531	Thanks a lot.

534	Hi, Felicia.
534	As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.
534	I simply don't organize my documents that way.
534	Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.
534	As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.
534	So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.
534	I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.
534	The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.
534	I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.
534	Let me know if you have questions.
534	Michelle Felecia Acevedo/ENRON@enronXgate 05/21/2001 04:09 PM To: Sharon Butcher/ENRON@enronXgate, Kriste Sullivan/ENRON@enronXgate, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cindy R Ward/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: Employment Contracts In my new roll in Compensation, I am trying to get comfortable that we have all the Employment Agreements up-to-date in the Corporate Compensation Database so that we can ensure that payments are made in a timely matter and contracts are looked at for renewal in the same timely manner.
534	What would help us tremendously is if we could get copies of all the contracts you produce for Corporate employees both VP and above and below VP so we can make sure they are entered into the Compensation Database.
534	Mary Joyce's group enters the VPs and above but Cindy Ward and I are responsible for making their payments under the contracts.
534	Because of this, I want to make sure we have copies and do not miss anyone.
534	As always, your help is very much appreciated!
534	Thanks!

535	Gina/David, I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions.
535	My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation.
535	Presumably, if they have a Click at Home PC, they can do it from there.
535	If not, we should be able to facilitate it manually.
535	Your thoughts?
536	Are you working on this?
536	MHC
537	Vicente, What is the status of our litigation in Puerto Rico?
537	Has there been a motion to remand?
537	Is anything scheduled in the next few weeks?
537	Have we received a scheduling order or a notice of Rule 26 hearing?
537	Thanks for the update.
537	Michelle
538	Thanks, Kerry.
538	That's what I thought.
538	Michelle Ben: As we discussed, the regulations from the department of labor specifically allow the employment of 14 to 16 year olds in non-hazardous employment.
538	The regulations, however, restrict employment to 40 hours in a week, 8 hours in a day, and between the hours of 7:00 am to 9:00 pm.
538	29 C.F.R.
538	570.35.
538	Thus, don't take the interns to a power plant and don't work them past 9:00 or the hours indicated and you should be ok.
538	Let me know if you have any follow up questions.

540	If the letter is to your satisfaction, please prepare for finalization on your letterhead and send to Mr. Loeb.

541	With PRC, I'm afraid I will forget these.
541	Thanks for your assistance.
542	Twanda, we should email the revisions to the Rome assignment letter to that lawyer.
542	Would you please do a draft?
542	Thanks.
542	Michelle
543	would you please email to Julia and Deb the consulting services agreement?

544	Hi, Kerry and Rick, Hope you are enjoying the employer.
544	Here, it is flooding again -- my son's school is closed today because of flooding.
544	What fun!
544	Here is a request from our business guys to get information on a potential labor dispute.
544	Any information you can get without being obvious would be helpful.
544	Thanks.

546	FYI -- additional information on Midwest Power.
546	Your detective abilities would be appreciated.
546	Michelle
547	FYI
548	Hi, Janel, I thought that I initialed those already.
548	If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.
548	In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp. If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.
548	Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.
548	I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.
548	She can either assist you or find someone else who can.
548	Thanks.
548	Michelle Janel Guerrero@ENRON 06/08/01 01:18 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Consulting Services Agreement Hi Michelle, I received the two executable copies of the CSA between Enron and KDS Communications.
548	I'm not sure what the next step is.
548	Should I overnight these to Ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one?
548	And I'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point?
548	I thought Linda Glynn mentioned something about Richard or someone else providing initials???
548	Just let me know.
548	thanks!
548	Also does legal keep a copy or do we keep the contract with us?
549	Diane, would you please track this down and let Cathy know that we'll respond asap when I return.
549	Or, you could have Kriste respond.
549	I do not remember seeing a letter from counsel, but it is possible that it fell through the cracks.
549	Thanks.
549	Michelle
550	Please note and put in a file for me regarding Enron AAPs.
550	That obviously will be of significance to me in my new role.
550	Thanks.

551	As described in my prior email, here is a list of Ludwin's transactions.
551	Let me know if you have any interest.
551	Michelle
552	Kerry, We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.
552	I hope all is ok, and that you didn't have too much damage.
552	Bellaire was hit pretty hard.
552	On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?
552	Twanda can connect you.
552	I'll be on vacation this week and will return the 18th.
552	Thanks.
552	Michelle
553	Diane, not a high priority, but would you please get with Kim Melodick and find out what the client group wants to do with the Alonzo Williams lawsuit?
553	He never answered, and currently is in default.
553	Thanks.
553	Michelle
554	Bummer about the flood insurance.
554	Of course, we had it and didn't need it.
554	We also pulled up our rugs, moved furniture, etc. Had we not, the house surely would have flooded.
554	Talk to you next week.
554	Michelle "Notestine, Kerry" 06/11/01 08:15 AM To: "'Michelle.Cash@enron.com'" cc: Subject: RE: Midwest Generation Thanks for the message.
554	We had about 2 inches of water in the house and we lost most of our flooring on the first floor.
554	Most everything else is ok.
554	No flood insurance because we are not in the 100 year flood plain as you know.
554	Regarding Midwest Generation.
554	I asked around with our Chicago lawyers and did not find out anything.
554	I have made some other contacts and will let you and Jeff Hodge (whom I have met) know if I hear about anything.
554	Littler Mendelson, PC 1900 Chevron Tower 1301 McKinney Street Houston, Texas 77010 713.951.9212 (fax)
555	Yes, I should be involved.
555	Have you sent Noel prior information?
556	That is a close call.
556	Has he already called on the acquiring company?
556	If so, then I would think it would be ok.
556	If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.
556	That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.
556	We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.
556	Michelle
557	Would you please send Rob Cole here at Enron a copy of our letter to EEOC for April?

560	Why does this person need Expertfinder?
560	I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails.
560	If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him?
560	More information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access.

561	Would you please send Janice Priddy the blank short form?
561	Thanks.
561	Michelle
562	Twanda, will you please handle this?
562	Add the inserts for the various items.
562	Michelle
563	I think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because our annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.
563	Also, we usually use some other language.
563	I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter.
563	Michelle
564	No, it should remain the top 25 percent, because it is the top percentage of the criteria, not the peer group.
564	Thanks.
564	Michelle
565	Do you know this person?
566	please send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement -- ok to send it by email.
566	thanks
567	Mark, Attached is a signed version of the Consulting Services Agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).
567	Yevgeny Frolov in HR is working on a project whereby Accenture is developing software for Enron.
567	Enron will own the content of the programs, and ultimately, licenses will be sold for the software, with Enron and Accenture sharing the royalty interest.
567	I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement.
567	I will send you a copy of the latest term letter, along with my handwritten comments on the draft.
567	Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these?
567	Yevgeny will contact you directly.
567	Thanks.

570	Michelle
571	Thanks for the info, Karen.
571	Go ahead and keep this in your file regarding Meliza, so that it can be there in the event we need it further.
571	Thanks.
571	Michelle
572	Twanda, please note.
572	MHC
573	Will do, once I receive the revised agreement from them.
573	Michelle
574	I spoke with her and got this information.
574	We are scheduling her to come in and meet with Mark Taylor, Cheryl Nelson, and others who have information about the position.
574	Molly, when is that interview scheduled?
574	Michelle
575	why don't we wait and share our revised policies with them?
576	Alan, do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town?
576	Michelle
577	Would you please find a copy of this and send to Felicia?
577	Thanks.
577	Michelle
578	I think this is in your ballpark, not mine!
579	I am happy to assist, although I think that this is Kriste's world.
579	I've passed this email on to her, and will assume that she has it covered, unless I hear otherwise.
579	Michelle
580	Thanks, Pat.
580	It is only temporary (at least, that's what I keep insisting!).
580	I just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in Wyoming or Montana (I can't remember now).
580	Data room to be opened in Denver on Monday.
580	I'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along.
580	Would you be available?
580	Thanks.
580	Michelle
581	Looks good to me.
582	Who will get them?
582	I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect the privilege.
582	Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is no protection if we find undesirable results.
583	Hello, all.
583	Attached is an invitation from Seyfarth Shaw to attend their labor and employment seminar.
583	It is scheduled for Tuesday, 7/17, and lasts only a half-day.
583	Generally, their seminars are high quality.
583	Plus, the cost is only $50.
583	Let me know if you plan to attend.
583	Michelle
584	I don't think that is a good idea.
585	I like that better.
585	When is that meeting?
585	Or, do we want to do that separately outside of the PRC evaluation meeting?
586	I'd check with Oxley first.
586	I kind of think they are separate issues, and I am not sure that the whole group needs to see the areas where we may have issues.
586	MHC
587	absolutely, unless Kerry plans to be nice to him
588	I can't attend, as I'll be out of the office in Austin at a mediation.
588	Michelle
589	Twanda, please send them hard copies of the invitation for Seyfarth's seminar.
589	Thanks.
589	MHC
590	How are we answering this type of question?
591	Oops -- too efficient.
592	please put in Curran's files.
593	I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.
593	We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.
593	Does that matter?
594	yes, it is redundant.
595	No, but we have been meeting on this topic.
595	We met early this week and are having a follow-up meeting next week.
595	I will ask Diane Goode to include you by phone, if you want to attend.
595	Michelle
596	They are done and should be in your email today.
596	MHC
597	Congratulations!!!!
597	I know you are happy to have that wrapped up.
597	Michelle
598	great -- let me know your feedback.
599	Also, say hi to Ted Meyer, who is my (and your) Bellaire neighbor.
600	FYI, if you didn't get this already.
600	Michelle
601	I've given the Japanese template to Twanda to revise -- please use the non-VP form and not the form on which I have made the revisions.
601	Thanks.
601	Michelle
602	Robin, Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K.
602	I know that Mary was involved in this to great detail.
602	Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance.
602	Mary and Tim Callahan have been coordinating those issues.
602	Michelle
603	Lance, Kim was here on Friday.
603	I have asked Mark Taylor for his thoughts.
603	Michelle
604	Will do.
604	I've asked Diane to send you the legal advice we received.
604	I've finalized the template today, and should have a draft out tomorrow (Monday).
604	Michelle
605	No, this is not.
605	I am curious as to how this got to you.
605	I will give it a review and get back with you.
606	Freudian slip, I'm sure.
606	See you tomorrow!
606	Michelle
607	FYI -- see what you can find out about this -- perfect opportunity to market OLER's services.
607	Thanks MHC
608	Fran, would you mind pulling the data for GSP on this.
608	It is strange that we should be paying unemployment rates for GSP, since it is its own entity, separate and apart from Enron.
608	Do you know anything about the other transactions?
609	Sure, sounds like a good plan to put the flag in Personic to discuss the time limitations.
609	Other than the specific gas-related folks, I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees.
609	I'll double check to confirm, though.
609	MHC
610	Alan, I understand that you have approved the request below.
610	Is this because they are WRA personnel?
610	Thanks.
610	Michelle
611	FYI, with apologies if I already sent this to ya'll.
612	The consent form should be kept in PH file.
612	The background check results should be maintained separately.
612	MHC
613	Not a problem if the employee does not date it.
613	The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company.
613	MHC
614	Kathy, we should go ahead and remove these people.
614	They are employed by WRA, which is in a transition process on a confidential matter.
614	Please remove them.
614	Thanks.
614	Michelle
615	Looks fine with me.
616	Twanda, please handle.
616	MHC
617	I've sent this to litigation unit.
617	MHC
618	Cathy, I have been getting this question a lot!
618	It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.
618	Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.
618	If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect.
618	Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.
618	Michelle
619	I believe that these involve issues of intellectual property and thus are more appropriately decided by you.
619	In principle, I have no issue with Enron indemnifying Accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership.
619	On the logo issue, I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks.
619	Michelle
620	who knows.
620	I can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees.
620	Michelle
621	so, would we have an issue?
622	Please arrange as many of these as you can.
622	Michelle
623	this looks fine with me.
623	Michelle
624	Please save as a MHC document -- I think that some of this will be used for powerpoint for Nepco trip next week.
624	Thanks.
624	MHC
625	Mike, Would you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the NEPCO charge?
625	I would like to obtain information from him and be "in the loop" on all legal matters involving NEPCO's employment practices issues.
625	Thanks a lot.
625	I am looking forward to visiting with you in person next week.
625	Michelle
626	Twanda, please print this for me - -I've been having problems when I try to print.
626	Thanks.
626	Michelle
627	Pat, what do you think of this?
627	I view it as problemmatic because I believe the grant agreements and the stock plan should govern.
627	Your comments and suggested revisions would be appreciated.
627	Thanks.
627	Michelle
628	Sharon, I suggest that we ask Valeria Hope to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly.
628	What do you think?
628	Michelle
629	sounds great!
629	I've asked Twanda to set something up.
629	MHC
630	Valeria is looking into it.
630	Michelle
631	FYI -- He tried to call me today, but missed me.
631	I have returned his call and left a voice mail for him.
631	I'll let you know if we have a chance to visit.
631	Michelle
632	Thanks, but we got it from the vault late yesterday.
632	Michelle
633	Thanks.
633	I'll do an assignment letter formalizing the relationship.
633	Michelle
634	FYI, it looks like you are on the way to approval.
634	Until that time, if you have any excess capacity in terms of time, get with Valeria on HR Employee Relations efforts.
634	Thanks.
634	MHC
635	These changes look fine to me for employees working in Japan.
635	Thanks.
635	Michelle
636	FYI, these should be in our form files for Japan -- this is the new Form B for Japan.
636	Michelle
637	Shanna, Botchlett is not interested in mediating at this time.
637	He wants to go for the jugular, I guess.
637	MHC
638	Hi, all.
638	On the budget for HR Risk Management (formerly OLER), Cindy told me to keep things flat for next year.
638	I would appreciate seeing the numbers for budget projections and actuals for the group year to date, though.
638	Thanks.
638	Michelle
639	Dan, Wayne Perry has issues with the consulting agreement I drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past.
639	Do you want to pick it up?
639	By copy of this, I am asking Twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him.
639	Michelle
640	I'll be there!
640	Do we have a meeting with Shankman for tomorrow?
641	Teresa, The employment lawyer at Littler, Mendelson is named Kerry Notestine.
641	He is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements.
641	I also will have emailed him my summary of the Bob Henderson agreement, so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena.
641	His number, in case you need an immediate response while I am at NEPCO next week, is 713-652-4748.
641	Michelle
642	Hi, David!
642	I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.
642	I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in Houston.
642	Specifically, an employee named Jason Davis claims that he was fired from his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.
642	OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.
642	Have you heard of this?
642	How would you like to handle it?
642	We can discuss in more detail on Thursday.
642	Michelle
643	Pat, would you please give this a look and provide comments?
643	Thanks.
643	Michelle
644	Diane, would you please send Valeria the recent (positive) article on PRC?
644	Thanks.
644	Michelle
645	Pat, I think this isolates the employment-related comments for the Brooklyn Navy Yard transaction.
645	Your comments would be appreciated.
645	Thanks.
645	MHC
646	I don't know if you heard, but Kim and I spoke with him, and he is ok with everything.
646	I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to Kim and me for review and placement in the file.
646	Thanks!
647	sounds good to me.
648	Cameron sleeps in a real bed, but would be happy on the floor as well.
648	No more cribs, yea!!
648	Great news about the tix.
648	We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats -- if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door, that works for us.
648	We are so excited!!
649	will do
650	No, I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical!
650	I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman.
651	I'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.
651	Can that be rectified, or is that beyond your role?
652	I have not.
652	I'll send a follow-up email today.
653	Absolutely!
653	I agree that it would be great for you.
654	I know we had some sensitivity in the past; let me check on it and get back with you.
654	mhc
655	Rick, I believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts -- almost everyone has emailed me with that information already, pursuant to my prior request.
655	I'll forward those to you for your information.
655	I would like to institute some limitations on training for the group, due to costs and out-of-office considerations, but I have not finalized those recommendations yet.
655	Stay tuned!
655	MHC
656	Pat, I am keeping you busy these days.
656	Any comments on below?
656	Michelle
657	Neither did I. I just got the comments yesterday.
657	I'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments.
657	Michelle
658	I'm handling the afternoon -- I think that Harry has this morning.
658	MHC
659	Here is the overview of Bob Henderson's Employment Agreement.
660	What do you think?
660	MHC
661	Please send David Lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter (use Bridgeline example -- with and without non-compete).
661	Michelle
662	We're formatting one this week, and we'll send it when it's done.
662	Michelle
663	I agree also, but I don't know all the parties or complications involved.
663	Should there be a (groan) meeting on this?
664	Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting.
664	Thanks.
664	MHC
665	Shanna, I spoke with Per tonight about this.
665	Let's talk tomorrow.
665	Thanks.
665	Michelle
666	Let's discuss exactly what is involved here -- confidentiality, etc. Thanks.
666	MHC
667	please print all these for me.
667	Thanks.
667	MHC
668	generally, we just go by the terms in the agreement and attach a brief position description.
669	Let's meet with her and anyone else she would like to have attend.
669	Thanks.
669	MHC
670	Mark, I understand that this is a copy of the latest agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting.
670	I agree that a new master would be a good idea.
670	Michelle
671	Misha, I haven't yet received the details about the lunch on the 28th.
671	I'm out on vacation the end of next week, so I wanted to try to fill it early next week.
671	Could you forward me the invitation or details?
671	Thanks.
671	MHC
672	Thanks, Misha.
672	How many are at a table?
672	I've already got some folks who are interested.
672	Michelle
673	In my dealings with Accenture, they have acted as if this is the agreement that governs them.
673	I don't know which Accenture group is involved, however.
673	Either way, I believe that it is time for an updated agreement, with better rates.
673	Have you been working with Global Strategic Sourcing on this?
674	I'll get it set up.
674	Michelle
675	Indeed I will.
675	MHC
676	David, Derrick approved the use of Charlie Caulkin.
676	Also, here is info on the Denver lawyer who should review the issues relating to the sharing of employees.
676	Do you want to call him, or would you like me to?
676	Good to see you this week.
676	Michelle
677	Frank, I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week.
677	During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday.
677	I haven't seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today.
677	Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn't heard of that if you were.
677	Would you please let me know the status?
677	Thanks a lot!
677	Michelle
678	Twanda is out today and Monday; I'll do the best I can.
679	Please save these to a MHC document -- I've got edits.
679	Thanks.
679	MHC
680	Dear Grandmother, So sorry we didn't make it yesterday.
680	We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.
680	Oops!!!
680	He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn't hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok.
680	So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.
680	Hope all is well with you.
681	Ryan, I think we should have some draft answers for these -- get with the MAD team to see what kinds of answers we have given in the past on these types of questions.
681	Thanks.
681	Michelle
682	Thanks for the good words.
682	I appreciate your input.
682	Michelle
683	Valeria, FYI -- here are kudos from one of your clients!
683	Keep up the good work!
683	Michelle
684	Not that I know of.
684	Michelle
685	I don't know.
685	I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters.
685	Sorry I am so clueless.
685	MHC
686	FYI
687	FYI
688	please make changes.
689	Diane, there are lots of emails about this topic.
689	Would you please print them and collect them in a file labelled for Tobias?
689	Thanks.
689	MHC
690	I don't know -- I think we've categorized them as severance, but maybe we should get with Mackin.
690	MHC
691	Diane, I've left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please follow up, as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call.
691	Basically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we want to dissolve it.
691	Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail?
691	Thanks.
691	Michelle
692	Donna, I think this falls in your court.
692	Let me know if it should be handled elsewhere.
692	Thanks.
692	Michelle
693	please calendar -- I'd like to go.
694	Let's discuss when we both can talk.
694	MHC
695	Here is the first part of Kerry's email.
695	MHC
696	I've received advice from Vinson & Elkins on this, which I will send your way.
696	It looks like we can.
696	MHC
697	Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?
697	Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.
697	Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.
697	Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.
697	Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.
697	The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco.
697	How does that impact the question below?
697	Thanks!
697	Michelle
698	You are invited to sit at the Enron table for the Father of the Year luncheon on August 28 at 11:45 at the Hyatt Regency.
698	This event is a delightful one, where there are tributes paid to several "outstanding" fathers in the community.
698	Please let me know if you would be able to attend.
699	Pat, I hope you are feeling well.
699	Kidney stones sound painful!!
699	Take care of yourself.
699	Michelle
700	Twanda, please pull all emails on this subject matter out of my in box and print for the file.
700	Thanks.
700	MHC
701	No. I believe that the answer will be to destroy the materials, but I am double-checking the research on that this afternoon.
701	Thanks.
701	MHC
702	April 20
703	FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company.
703	It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.
703	The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.
703	The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.
703	I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.
703	I would like to talk about how to manage that.
703	Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.
703	Thanks.
703	Michelle
704	So, my question goes to the highest bidder .
704	.
704	.
705	Of course -- I was just giving you grief!
706	hard to offend me
707	please print these for me.
707	Thanks.
707	mhc
708	Thanks!!
709	FYI.
709	I've left him a message that it is "no problem" in this instance.
709	But, I know that you were interested in having it reviewed before it went out, so I wanted to let you know what was happening.
709	MHC
710	Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser's attorney.
710	He basically wants a year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).
710	I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand.
710	Let me know if you want to know the details.
710	I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.
710	In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.
710	Michelle
711	I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.
711	It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.
711	Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.
711	Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have a duty to report it.
711	We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.
711	Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.
711	The number is 787-754-6000.
711	Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.
711	In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.
711	Michelle
712	Amy, at your convenience, please give me a call about Walter Coffer's review.
712	Thanks.
712	Michelle
713	Michelle Cash Assistant General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department
714	Tara, Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.
714	He certainly has a strong academic and work history.
714	Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.
714	We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.
714	The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.
714	So, please thank your friend for his interest.
714	If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.
714	Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.
714	Call me with any questions.
714	Michelle
715	Valeria.
715	Thanks for handling this one.
715	Please keekp me posted.
715	Michelle
716	John, how do you want to handle this?
716	Michelle
717	please print these and file -- AMPS.
717	Thanks.
717	MHC
718	Possible contract candidate.
719	Rick, would you mind getting on the transition of HRRM functions to the staffing and service center groups?
719	I think that you have the most familiarity with the processes and perhaps could facilitate that taking place next week.
719	Let's discuss.
719	Michelle
720	Please schedule me to attend this meeting.
720	Thanks.
720	MHC
721	this is ok with me
722	As a follow up to the discussion today, this may be of assistance.
722	Michell|
723	Yes, it has.
723	In fact, I gave the same message as you describe below.
723	Michelle
724	Please send the form consulting agreement to Randy.
724	Thanks.
724	MHC
725	please send to him our consulting services agreement and also the agreement for contract and other services (Diane has the latest form).
725	cc to Carol St. Clare.
725	Thanks!
726	please respond.
726	MHC
727	please print this plus all attachments.
727	MHC
728	Thanks for the resume.
728	This person's background won't work for us -- we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here, particularly M&A, major real estate, financing, etc. Thanks.
728	Michelle
729	yes, we still own the IP.
730	Sarah, At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.
730	Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.
730	Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first.
730	Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.
730	Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement.
731	I got this.
731	I assume this is 12:30 Central Time?
732	FYI re: NEPCO picketing issues.
732	Michelle
733	FYI re: NEPCO picketing issues.
734	FYI.
734	Michelle
735	The contents of this email are privileged and confidential.
735	Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.
735	If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.
735	IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to "salt" jobs down there in Florida.
735	The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.
735	The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.
735	We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.
735	Should we designate one person to handle union relations?
735	We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.
735	That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.
735	We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.
735	Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.
735	We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.
735	We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.
735	We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.
735	We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.
735	There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.
735	Other issues surround gating at the facility.
735	How will it be gated?
735	Who will control entry and exits?
735	What about the other ways into the site?
735	How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?
735	Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.
735	There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.
735	Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.
735	Back to Mark's suggestions: Be careful of calls coming into the project.
735	Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.
735	Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.
735	Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.
735	E.g., "Are you hiring electricians out there?"
735	Those should be referred to HR's off site office.
735	Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.
735	They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.
735	We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.
735	Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.
735	Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.
735	Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.
735	One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.
735	Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.
735	David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.
736	Please note that we do not agree with the terms of the letter attached to the resume.
736	We have provided a contract for review by your company, and that agreement should govern.
736	With that, thanks for the resume.
736	Michelle Cash
737	What do you mean by backdating?
737	I think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing.
738	Rick, Nice kudos from Robert.
738	Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.
738	As you may recall, she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists.
738	They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doing is essential.
738	Thanks.
738	Michelle
739	I agree with your take.
739	Plus, how will those employees be hired?
739	Is it part of the deal?
739	If so, then we will need to figure out how to document it.
739	Michelle
740	FYI, I forgot to forward this to you earlier.
740	MHC
741	please print this plus attachment and file under Corporate American Express Cards.
741	thanks
742	Please print this plus attachment and file Corporate American Express Cards.
742	thanks
743	please print this and file Corporate American Express Cards.
743	Thanks.
744	We're meeting now, near my office -- can you come?
745	George, I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts.
745	She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from Eric Connor.
745	Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.
745	I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data.
745	Let me know if you have any questions.
745	Michelle
746	Mike, I have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims.
746	I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.
746	I will send you a new waiver form to use.
746	The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA.
746	Michelle
747	Sandra, we need the password!
748	Here are some referrals for HR consultants.
748	Michelle
749	sounds good
750	No risk to non-compete.
750	The payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete.
750	MHC
751	I agree -- involve Valeria.
751	You also should invite my new lawyer, Lizzette Palmer.
751	Twanda is her assistant, also.
751	Thanks.
751	Michelle
752	FYI
753	I would say that the background check issue is a business call.
753	They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.
753	Same with the guarantee language.
753	If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.
753	That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.
753	Michelle
754	What about the change in control agreement for the other person you discussed?
754	I don't think we have seen that.
754	Thanks.
754	Michelle By the way, Fran Mayes and I both will be at the office tomorrow.
754	Please contact us at my office - 713-853-6401.
754	Thanks.
755	You sent this to me, Dan.
755	I have since clarified this with the GP attorneys.
755	Michelle
756	great result!
757	I have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it, except to the extent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that Corp. is looking to implement.
757	I agree with Paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-for personnel.
757	Paul, it might make sense for you to talk with Robert Jones and David Oxley, who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
757	Michelle
758	The OSHA complaint was dismissed.
758	Michelle
759	please get with him.
759	Michelle
760	Aaron, does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership interest, but that may not be a "subsidiary"?
760	Thanks.
760	Michelle
761	Please revise accordingly.
761	Thanks.
761	Michelle
762	Carol.
762	I spoke with lara robinson this morning.
762	She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made.
762	She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released.
762	Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees.
762	Seems unusual to me.
762	Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience.
762	My number is 713-218-7155.
762	Thanks.
762	Michelle
763	Dan.
763	I spoke with GP benefits counsel this morning.
763	There are several business issues outstanding.
763	Fran is trying to get with McMahon to get his take on tham.
763	He is at EB where she is doing a Super Saturday.
764	FYI.
764	Michelle
765	This will just be Rome and Enron.
765	Although we believe that most of his claims really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that Enron used HMS to defraud Rome.
765	His lawsuit will be against only Enron.
765	Therefore, it makes no sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed).
766	This is great!
766	Thanks for the info.
766	Michelle
767	Claudia, would you please arrange to have these collected?
767	Thanks.
767	Michelle
768	Great idea to put this out there.
768	FYI, I have arranged for Jack Wisdom to provide some training on wage and hour law issues in the next few weeks.
768	I'll keep you posted on the status of that.
768	Michelle
769	Under the Enron Corp. severance plan, can we provide employees with the opportunity to take voluntary termination in lieu of future involuntary term?
769	One of our offices wants to offer employees that opportunity, with some sort of enhanced benefit if they take it.
769	Your quick thoughts on this would be appreciated.
769	Michelle
770	We are working on this issue this week by meeting with Joe Dilg and putting forth a summary memo of the history of the situation, the pay requirements under the contract, and recommendations of how to move forward.
770	That will be done this week, and everyone on this email will be copied on it.
770	Michelle
771	I know, but that doesn't change the fact that we should articulate the standards that we are using -- I know that they use some criteria that are based on solid business reasons, so let's capture them!
771	That way, we at least can explain why we did things.
771	Michelle
772	who are they?
773	Fran, the latest on gp closing is Nov. 15 as a target, but the 30th is more likely.
773	Michelle
774	great, would youplease get this to Janette?
774	Thanks.
775	please put this into the last FAQ for the Metals stuff.
775	Michelle
776	FYI, please let me know if you have any comments.
776	Michelle
777	Here is a draft of the plan document we prepared for the Metals situation.
777	Michelle
778	Happy to talk with you about the ADA -- I've actually written two papers on the topic and edited an article in The Houston Lawyer on your very topic (albeit several years ago, which was before the Supremes spoke on the issue).
778	On the Senior Specialist position, I am happy to discuss that with you as well.
778	Please get with my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 39402 to schedule a time next week to talk.
778	Michelle
779	this guy is going to call to schedule -- give him 30 minutes.
779	mhc
780	FYI.
780	Michelle
781	The 2 weeks is the amount of years of service, or the amount of 10K increments in salary.
781	The 4 weeks is a premium on top of that amount.
782	That's the plan, stan.
783	try this
784	Thanks for getting me this info.
784	Michelle
785	Linda, I can't make 10 tomorrow, so go ahead and meet without me.
785	Lunch this week would be difficult, as I'm out Thursday and Friday attending the SW Legal Foundation Labor seminar in Dallas.
785	Would you like to try something next week with me and Lizzette Palmer, my new attorney?
785	If so, have your assistant get with Twanda at 853-9402 to schedule, as Twanda works for both me and Lizzette.
785	Thanks.
785	Michelle
786	when is this scheduled?
787	please calendar.
787	thanks
788	I haven't specifically referenced NuTech in my questions to them.
788	I also probably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of interest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron.
788	We'll discuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions.
788	Yikes!
789	Rescinding is what you meant to say.
790	I believe that this was not meant for public distribution, but it is a sentiment that I thought you should hear.
790	Michelle
791	Do we want them to be under employment agreements?
792	David, You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.
792	The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows: "Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."
792	This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.
792	Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.
792	Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.
792	As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).
792	That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.
792	If there is a decision not to break down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high.
792	For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.
792	Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.
792	Please let me know if you have any questions.
793	Should we wait on this, given the possibilities we discussed earlier today.
793	Michelle
794	I can't find it on my blackberry.
794	I can't remember who sent it, and the ones I've reviewed don't have the info.
794	Why don't you ask Shanna Funkhouser for the details?
794	Sorry about that!
794	Michelle
795	I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
795	Bummer.
796	Dear Maaico, Congratulations on the birth of daughter Laura!
796	She looks great -- very healthy and all.
796	It also is great to see how little Bart is growing up.
796	He is a beautiful boy!
796	You must be so happy and proud to have two healthy children.
796	I will send you some fun pictures of my son, Cameron, who has learned to stand on his head -- he is very proud.
796	Congratulations again, and take care.
796	Love, Michelle
797	Was this adopted?
798	those were fine -- no changes.
798	I just didn't want to fax them from the hotel due to cost.
798	mhc
799	Hi there!!
800	From whom?
801	Am I getting a good package?
802	I think you should be there, so it can wait until later in the week.
802	Other priorities obviously govern.
802	Thanks.
802	Michelle
803	I would not want any of our policies to address what is "unlawful," as I believe that is a matter for a court.
803	Instead, our policies should state what we want to have in them, and leave the issue of legality to others.
803	Plus, I wouldn't want any admission of unlawful conduct in our policies.
803	Michelle
804	yes.
804	I have contacts there, if you want.
804	Michelle
805	If it is same as mid-year, then I won't need to look at it.
805	Thanks.
805	Michelle
806	Sorry, I don't.
806	Michelle
807	Jeff couldn't make it.
807	We'll reschedule at his availability.
807	MHC
808	Thanks, but no headhunters.
808	I can't afford a fee.
808	Michelle
809	Kelly, Do you have members of GSS on this list (I can't tell based on names)?
809	I'll have my assistant get with you on calendaring.
809	Michelle
810	Unbelievable!!
810	I guess he has sour grapes.
810	We only paid him not to apply for a job -- unfortunately, insults were not contemplated in our agreement.
810	Ignore him.
810	Michelle
811	FYI Michelle
812	Here is a list of EWS labor agreements, from Rick Johnson.
812	Let me know if you require more information.
812	Michelle
813	Thanks.
813	mhc
814	Here is what we are hearing.
814	It sounds like it is out of Millie's hands and is up the INS.
814	We'll keep you posted.
814	Michelle
815	yea!
815	Great work, Valeria!
815	Michelle
816	what will the success fee look like?
816	Michelle
817	I think it would be best to get those terms in this agreement.
818	FYI, in case you don't already have this.
818	Michelle
819	Hello, John.
819	I am forwarding this to you at the request of Rob Walls.
819	Let me know if you also would like to have the litigation summary for employment matters.
819	Michelle
820	done -- do you also want me to send him the list of litigation?
821	I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.
821	I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.
821	If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.
821	If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.
821	Michelle
822	perfect!
822	I hope that we can make it!!
822	Michelle
823	Did you have a chance to respond?
824	please do an assignment.
824	Michelle
825	Thanks for the thoughts.
825	We are getting through it.
825	Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.
825	So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.
825	I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!
825	Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.
825	I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.
825	We went to the opera Sat.
825	night -- Tanenhouser.
825	Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?
825	Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.
825	I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center.
825	It was amazing.
825	Joan Lunden MC'd.
825	The Houston Symphony provided music.
825	Video from George W. Bush.
825	Speech by GHW Bush.
825	Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony.
825	It was quite the event.
825	Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother (one of these things is not like the other!).
825	Still, we had a great time.
825	So, not all gloom and doom around here.
825	Well, I'd better get back to it.
825	Michelle
826	I have seen this, but I don't think it should go out.
826	David/Mary/Cindy, please correct me if I'm wrong.
826	Michelle
827	would you please handle?
827	Thanks.
827	Michelle
828	Neil, why not put them under an agreement?
828	That would cover all of these aspects, as well as info re: fees, etc. Michelle
829	sounds good -- I'll send you a standard confidentiality agreement, which also contains a non-solicitation of employees.
829	Michelle Twanda, would you please do a standard confidentiality agreement for this company for my review?
829	Thanks.
829	Michelle
830	wouldn't you want them not to solicit the employees they meet when they talk with you and your team?
831	do you want me to allow them to solicit you?
831	Just say the word.
832	FYI.
832	Michelle
833	Let's get with Tommy to expedite it, if you want.
833	L, M
834	who says they would want him?
835	Any officer can sign for Enron -- generally speaking, we like to have the BU head sign.
835	Michelle
836	I don't think that this is a good idea for her process or any other general process.
837	Jon is the perfect choice if he is an officer of that entity.
837	Michelle
838	Sure, we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people.
838	They would have issues around payroll and benefits, but those can be handled.
838	Michelle
839	We need to talk about that meeting with me, Mike, and John.
839	I do not think it went well at all, but I would like to discuss it with you.
839	Michelle
840	great -- thanks!
841	please calendar.
841	Thanks.
841	Michelle
842	What a delightful and welcome change of pace in my email today!
842	Definitely count us in. We'd love to join you.
842	By the way, do you have Mata Kroger's new phone number?
842	Or, is she still with Comsys?
842	Thanks!
842	Michelle
843	please draft.
843	thanks.
843	Michelle
844	Go ahead and ask her to have the attorney call me.
844	Michelle
845	Sheila, Could you please provide me with PH files and also complete the charts on the following people?
845	Some of them may have left the company, and others may never have been employed.
845	Will you have access to all current/former employees' information?
845	If not, who would?
845	Thanks tons!!
845	Michelle
846	It might help if I gave you the names!
846	Amy Flores Michael Hinds Chris Loehr Michelle Stroud Joyce Tang Ben Thomason Rudy de la Paz Frank Felicia Thanks!
847	Jo Ann, Can you provide the answers for me?
847	Then I can decide how to proceed with Arthur.
847	Thanks.
847	Michelle
848	John and Louise , I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.
848	I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.
848	I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.
848	A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp. I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.
848	Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.
848	Let me know if you would like any more information.
848	You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.
848	Michelle
849	For your information -- Here is some severance language I received from Littler.
849	Michelle
850	Not needed -- we have Ogletree on it.
850	Michelle
851	We need to do assignments for these folks.
851	Thanks.
851	Michelle
852	Good day, Diomedes, First, let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your earlier email.
852	I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments has begun!
852	Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the processing.
852	However, if you have questions about timing, please feel free to call me at 713-853-6401 or Pam Butler at 713-853-6161.
852	Feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter further.
852	Michelle
853	I do not have any of this information -- Cathy, is the Metals plan the same as Enron domestic?
853	If so, then I would suggest that Chris Rahaim participate in this process.
853	Feel free to work with me on it, but I just don't have any data.
853	Thanks.
853	Michelle
854	I am not aware of any.
855	I am happy for us to paper the deal.
855	I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset.
855	Michelle
856	We have confirmed the amounts of the contracts.
856	When I speak of processing, it relates to the processing of the checks/wire transfers.
857	Thanks, Lynn, for the update.
857	If they have no interest in putting a settlement offer out there, then I suggest that we schedule the plaintiff's deposition.
857	Let's turn up the heat.
857	Michelle
858	Vicki, As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.
858	He seeks damages of $1 million.
858	Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.
858	I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.
858	I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.
858	The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me).
858	The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.
858	The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.
858	According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.
858	We have 30 days to remove to federal court.
858	Let me know how you want me to proceed.
858	Michelle
859	Twanda, could you please detach this attachment and send it to the following email address from my email?
859	I just don't want all the other communications enclosed.
859	We need to cc: Julia Murray.
859	Thanks!
859	Michelle
860	David, I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.
860	I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc. They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.
860	For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.
860	It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.
860	Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.
860	I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.
860	Michelle
861	This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?
861	I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here.
861	Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?
861	Let's be very clear.
861	I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.
862	Leslie, I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.
862	Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.
862	Would it be possible for us to arrive late?
862	I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.
862	Thanks!
862	Michelle
863	please print and put in diomedes christodolou file.
863	thanks
864	please print and file in diomedes christodolou's file.
864	thanks.
864	mhc
865	Pam, I guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract.
865	We probably should get with Castleman this week.
865	Michelle
866	please print and file in diomedes christodolou file.
866	thanks.
866	mhc
867	Jo Ann, what is the answer?
867	Michelle
868	FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.
868	He gave me some scoop on the trip.
868	The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.
868	Lots of good food.
868	One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.
868	You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).
868	Later, Michelle
869	Who would see or use this?
870	Add to your question list.
870	Michelle
871	I'll be out also -- on the cruise, baby!!!!
872	Your thoughts?
873	We are planning to attend, although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm.
873	I have got to get out there, as you can appreciate!!
873	But I hope to see you at Kari's house.
873	I know Trey and Cam will be there.
873	Michelle
874	Not yet.
874	Michelle
875	If he wants it.
875	But I would like a waiver, so I think we should consider some sort of payment.
875	Michelle
876	T. Would you please send runner to get this?
876	Thanks mhc
877	That is fine, but I do have to get Cameron today, so let Shanna know.
877	Thanks.
877	Mich
878	How are we handling others in that group?
878	We must be consistent.
878	Let's discuss.
878	Michelle
879	How much?
880	they're fine.
880	michelle
881	I would suggest that we require a waiver before we pay the money.
882	Please review and let me know what the traders want to do on this -- by Thursday would be good.
882	Michelle
883	yes, if you send me the names and the amounts we will be paying, we'll put them together.
883	mhc
884	please calendar.
884	thanks.
884	mhc
885	please begin to prepare this.
885	I've asked her how much.
885	MHC
886	doesn't this sound divine.
886	.
886	.
887	Attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment.
887	I have consolidated drafts done by Fran Mayes and Terry Bosien.
887	If you have other forms that you think work better, please send them our way.
887	I think it will be useful to work from the same document across Enron.
887	Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations.
887	Michelle
888	The minimum number of days should be 21, and they should have 7 days to revoke it.
888	Although the ADEA probably would not apply to A&A candidates, it could be an issue for the rest of the organization.
888	Michelle
889	The attachments didn't make it.
890	No. Sounds right.
891	Yes.
891	I have been working those.
891	After I get all info I wil probably consolidate and give to sharon for keping but I think it make sense forme to consolidate all info on these employees.
891	Thanks.
891	M
892	Unfortunately, I do not think we'll have time for this today, given other critical priorities.
892	I would suggest that the deadline may be slipping in light of other activities.
892	Michelle
893	Can you provide some insight?
893	Thanks.
893	Michelle
894	Hi, Janette and Diane, Based on my conversations with Mark, we are going to revise this letter a bit.
894	So, hold off on giving them to him until the next round!
894	Thanks.
894	Michelle
895	The intent is not to include 16b officers.
895	Payments will not be made if termination occurs prior to payment date.
895	I'll get back with you on the other issues.
895	Michelle
896	Never mind on this -- Twanda took care of it.
896	Thanks!!
896	Michelle
897	As we discussed, here is the second set of Q&As.
897	Your comments would be appreciated.
897	Michelle
898	FYI -- I guess we'll all be busy.
898	Michelle
899	Thanks!
899	I needed a little levity.
899	Michelle
900	FYI
901	In case you didn't get this.
901	Michelle
902	Although this is EWS floor meeting, you may want to come to hear the messages being delivered.
902	MHC
903	Here are the details.
903	Michelle
904	David, Just a question as to whether Dynegy has been notified that we are amending the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing with performance bonus memo?
904	We may want to send a brief email confirming the discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files.
904	Thanks.
904	Michelle
905	I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.
905	Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.
905	I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.
905	We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.
905	In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.
905	Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.
905	Ya'll let me know if you disagree.
906	Has this been approved by David Oxley?
906	If not, we can't proceed.
906	Thanks.
906	Michelle
907	The meeting with Mark Haedicke has been scheduled for 2:00 tomorrow.
907	Kerry, I suggest that you arrive by 1:45, as our security has increased significantly.
907	By copy of this email, I am asking Twanda to call the security console to alert them of your arrival.
907	Please ask for me when you arrive -- extension 36401.
907	We'll meet with Mark and then meet with David Oxley, who runs HR for the company, to discuss your role while I am out and beyond.
907	Thanks.
907	Michelle
908	Hi Dawn, I am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts.
908	I do not have signed copies of several Enron Canada agreements.
908	Would you mind faxing them down to me via Twanda as soon as possible on Friday?
908	We are on a Lavo deadline.
908	Thanks.
908	The people are: Chad Clark, Mike Cowan, Paul Devries, Eric LeDain, Chris Dorland, John McKay, and John Zufferli (only if he signed the one we did for Enron Canada for him-- I have the ENA one dated 12/24/99).
908	I appreciate your assistance.
908	Please call Twanda before the fax arrives, as it is a central legal department fax and not a private one.
908	Thanks a lot!!
908	Michelle
909	Twanda, how can we get these?
909	Can we enlist Knudsen's help?
909	Thanks.
909	Michelle
910	Based on my review of the files, we do not have signed agreements for the following: Tom Alonso* Mark Fischer* Ben Jacoby Laura Luce Mike McDonald Dave Parquet Gregg Penman Frank Vickers Andy Zipper Would you mind asking the vault if they have these?
910	If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them?
910	Thanks.
910	(By the way, no one should know why).
910	Thanks a lot!!
910	Michelle
911	Eric, As mentioned in my voice mail, Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP employment matters.
911	I believe that he may be better suited to answer your questions (and may have the time while I am out on vacation next week).
911	His number is 973-966-8117.
911	I have left him a voice mail telling him that you may give him a call, so he will be prepared.
911	I hope that is helpful.
911	Michelle
912	Absolutely, I agree with that.
912	Michelle
913	I like the message and agree that communication is critical at this time.
913	Should we go right out and say that no one will be affected next week (more artfully phrased of course)?
913	I believe that is the right way to go (no terminations Thanksgiving week), so I'd like to go ahead and say it.
913	Michelle
914	I have retained Kerry Notestine from Littler Mendelson to help me on this project, so we don't need to get Bob Vote involved.
915	yes, that would be great.
915	Michelle
916	Cole, here are the revisions to the benefit plan q&a doc.
916	I think these are ready to go if these comments are incorporated -- but check with Barrow on them.
916	On your question about being able to put some of them on the web, let's go through which ones can go and which ones need to be further reviewed.
916	Thanks.
916	Michelle
917	I agree, unless some of them have moved from EEL to ENA or vice versa.
917	In that situation, we definitely want to know about it so that the docs can be assigned.
917	Michelle
918	Pat, please let me know if my email of last night did not go through.
918	I am in the office now 713-853-6401.
918	Thanks!!
918	Michelle
919	FYI, Sharon will handle maintaining the list of all persons who are critical witnesses in future litigation so that we can take that into consideration when managing personnel decisions.
919	Michelle
920	FYI -- I've been reviewing most of the Q&As on the questions raised post merger announcement.
920	I don't think you need to do much, but I wanted you to be aware that this was going on.
920	Michelle
921	Lizzette and Ryan, Kriste and I substantially revised the waiver agreement today, so sit tightKriste, do you want to add the mediation provision?
921	I'll leave that to youMichelle
922	FYI.
922	Let us know if these folks are appropriate to include on our "critical for litigation" list.
922	Thanks!
922	Michelle
923	Thanks a lot for managing this!
924	Valeria, I agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain.
924	This has gone on too long.
924	Michelle
925	Lance, Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!
925	I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.
925	Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.
925	Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.
925	PRC results would not be the sole factor.
925	Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.
925	That result obviously would be disasterous.
925	Michelle
926	I think this looks good.
926	For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones.
926	That makes it easier to populate.
926	One other field to add would be visa status.
926	As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.
926	You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.
926	Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary.
926	Thanks.
926	Michelle
927	Pat, I really like that approach.
927	Looks great to me!
927	Michelle
928	Kriste, did you get this?
928	If not, I think it really works!!
928	Michelle
929	Pat, I am not sure if your email to Kriste went through -- I've forwarded it to her.
929	BUt, FYI, her address is kriste.sullivan@enron.com.
929	Thanks for all your help!
930	Kriste, I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete.
930	The only one in question is for Brian Redmond, whose contract we did not have.
930	Jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda.
930	Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing.
930	Then (I hope) we'll be done!!!!
930	Thanks.
930	Michelle PS, the number to the grammar hotline is 713-221-8670.
931	Stewart called me last week for some advice.
931	I had to leave a message for him when I called him back.
931	So, I gave him your names as backup in case he needs immediate assistance.
931	Just wanted you to know that he might be calling one of you.
931	Michelle
932	David, Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.
932	She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.
932	Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.
932	At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.
932	With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.
932	In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.
932	She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.
932	Do you know about that?
932	If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?
932	I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.
932	Let me know your thoughts on this.
932	Michelle
933	I think this works.
933	What is the best way to incorporate this into the plan?
934	I'm holding off on these until I get the package from PR.
935	My info is correct.
935	Michelle
936	yes, indeed..
937	Here is a proposed communication regarding severance plan changes.
937	This proposal makes me most nervous.
937	My recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan, thus letting the plan speak for itself.
937	We then could arm HR with a list of FAQs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole.
937	What do you think?
937	Also, Kriste, we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication, as not all Enron entities have this plan (e.g., NEPCO).
937	Same thing with vacation.
937	Michelle
938	What do you think?
938	We have a babysitter that night already, although I am sure we could cancel it.
939	I am a bit unclear.
939	Are these ready for my final review yet?
939	If so, I will get right on them.
939	Michelle
940	Terrie, On the issue of communicating the restated severance plan, below is the recommendation of four different attorneys who have considered the issue.
940	Michelle
941	Thanks, I agree.
941	Michelle
942	Karen, is this now ready for my review?
943	No rush on this -- late this week is fine.
943	Michelle
944	Would you please handle this?
944	Thanks.
944	Michelle
945	This is fine, but is it harsh enough?
946	I got a call from Rome's lawyer, who wants to call the whole thing off because he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants.
946	I told him we were ready and willing to proceed.
946	He was going to call the mediator to see if he could cancel without incurring the mediation fees.
946	So, I'll keep you posted.
946	Michelle
947	I'll get back with you asap.
947	Michelle
948	FYI re: offer revocation.
948	Michelle
949	Money.
950	I am not sure I understand the question.
950	Give me a call when you have a chance.
950	Michelle
951	The good news is, we don't owe a mediation fee, right?
951	Lizzette, I'll give Jack a call.
951	Michelle
952	My recommendation would be that we don't comment at all, but let the terms of the Plan and the related waivers speak for themselves.
952	We cannot provide them with legal advice.
952	Michelle
953	I don't think that is true.
953	Our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims.
953	I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.
954	I agree.
955	I'd like a copy of that, if possible.
955	I think it should state: Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclosed to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department.
955	If possible, put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook.
955	Michelle
956	Go ahead and pose the question, but the answer should be that we don't comment at all on litigation, and that the terms of severance plan and related waivers will govern the situation.
956	We should reiterate that we can't provide with legal advice.
956	Michelle
957	What is he asking?
958	It is in the Q&As already posted.
958	We cannot comment on HR policies/plans for Dynegy or for the merged entity because we simply don't know.
958	Michelle
959	I guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like.
959	Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.
959	Michelle
960	I will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all Enron entities domestically.
960	Similarly, some Enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, etc. So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications.
960	I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue.
960	Michelle
961	Simone, how do I get to LiveLink again?
962	I think that ya'll have handled the legal work for these entities in the past.
962	Can you provide Ann with this information asap?
962	Thanks!
962	Michelle
963	Ann, I've looked over this list and realized I have no relevant information, so I've forwarded it to Sharon and Kriste, who should be able to help you.
963	Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.
963	Michelle
964	I have reviewed the contract for Brent.
964	He has a 3-month non-compete after the termination of his employment.
964	Is he planning to honor it?
964	If not, we have to make decisions about pursuing him in court.
964	Michelle
965	I agree that it is best to leave alone.
966	Yes.
966	Send to me.
966	Thanks.
966	Michelle
967	It shiuld be cynthia barow instead.
967	I think the benefits info already is in what we sent to katie caplan at weil.
967	Let me know how I can help.
967	Michelle
968	Go ahead and notify.
969	What a jerk
970	I don't think we should curtail cause terminations.
970	Others would probably be best to wait unless there is a disruptive situation.
970	Michelle
971	You should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.
971	We do have a plan in place, but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan in the last few weeks.
971	So, we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now.
971	Michelle
972	We need the following data asap: 1.
972	Number of total employees at all Enron entities broken down by domestic and US 2.
972	Breakdown of those domestic employees by whether they are hourly or salaried 3.
972	Amount of accrued, unpaid vacation balance.
972	Michelle
973	I agree.
973	No offer.
973	Let him pursue his claims with everyone else.
973	Michelle
974	Yep
975	Sarah.
975	Please feel free to call me on my cell at 713-302-5522 or at home at 713-218-7155 if you need to reach me urgently.
975	Michelle
976	I think that we should enforce the agreement.
976	Did he get a signing bonus?
976	If so he probably will have to pay back.
976	He also will have to hnor noncompete.
976	What happened with Brent Price?
976	Michelle
977	Sure
978	Kathy, Would you please get access to expertfinder reinstated for my group: me, Lizzette Palmer, Twanda Sweet, and Diane Goode?
978	Thanks a bunch!!
978	Michelle
979	I left a voice mail for Terrie, indicating that I think we should close out this communication with something to the effect of: "If you have further questions, please contact ________________."
980	This looks fine with me.
980	Michelle
981	I think that is right, but I do not have the data to confirm that.
981	Michelle
982	Thanks.
982	We're using Weil.
982	Talk to you soon.
982	Michelle
983	I would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging.
983	If we agreed to do so, then our records should reflect that service date.
983	Michelle
984	Sure.
984	I didn't read it all but assume it is ok.
984	Michelle
985	Ill see what I can find out for you.
985	Michelle
986	Get with David Lund.
987	Nepco is not in br.
987	Let's discuss the charges.
987	M
988	Thanks.
988	Both of us are still here.
988	You of all people know how hard yesterday was for me.
988	I hope never To have to go through that type of experience again.
988	Talk to you soon.
988	Michelle
989	I assume that you are working with Terrie James on this.
989	The answer depends, so we need to be careful about how we answe it.
989	Michelle
990	I'm still here.
990	It has been very rough this week.
990	Thanks for checking with me.
990	Michelle
991	FYI.
991	We have suspended our neutral reference practice in light of the layoffs yesterday.
992	FYI, I have heard from some folks that business folks think that too many HR people are gone, so I think they may be ok with numbers.
992	Michelle
993	The answer is no.
993	We can't provide personnel information to anyone outside the company.
993	Not appropriate at any time.
993	Michelle
994	Can you and +iane please join me Sharon and Kriste at 2 for a status meeting?
994	Go tob 16.
995	Kari, this is helpful.
995	Is there any way we can delete the names of persons who no longer are here?
995	Thanks.
995	Michelle
996	I am working with Mary Joyce on that right now.
996	Michelle
997	I think we should consider this request.
998	I think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $4500 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 12/31.
998	Please refer her to the Q&As on the web site for details.
998	Michelle
999	I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.
999	They want the following asap: Signed copies of contracts for Greg Whalley and Vince Kaminsky (who may not have a contract) Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as Jay Webb (I think I can get this one as well).
999	They also want the following data for the 838: Name 2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc) Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc. (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number) If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract Did the person get a stay bonus last week?
999	If so, amount.
999	Date of hire If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.
999	They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.
999	Thanks a lot!
999	Michelle
1000	please file "Pam Benson".
1000	Thanks.
1000	MHC
1001	please file in Diomedes' file.
1001	Thanks.
1001	MHC
1002	fine with me.
1002	mhc
1003	You need more than the 840 for this -- you also need the IT personnel.
1003	I'll forward those to Kathy so she can get started.
1003	Thanks.
1003	Michelle
1004	Here is the second list.
1004	Michelle
1005	I got this request a second time.
1005	Probably Fran would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid.
1006	Alan, I got a request from Carey Sloan that we confirm in writing that he was no longer an officer or board member of any Enron entity as of the last date of his employment.
1006	Can we do that?
1006	If so, who can assist?
1006	Thanks.
1006	Michelle
1007	We missed Diane's birthday on Friday -- I can't believe I forgot it!!!
1007	I'd like to get cake Monday afternoon.
1007	Michelle
1008	We are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue.
1008	Michelle
1009	I agree.
1009	But we should pay them the 4500.
1010	We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.
1010	However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.
1010	We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.
1010	Let me know if you have questions.
1010	Which deal are you actively working on?
1010	Fire or Wind?
1010	Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?
1010	Thanks.
1010	Michelle
1011	Here are my comments.
1011	Thanks.
1011	Michelle
1012	Go ahead and let them stay until vesting.
1012	Please reverse their terminations and see if there is any work they can do until the termination day.
1012	If they got the $4500, offset that amount from pay.
1012	Michelle
1013	We will need to look at our vacation pay practice with Weil to determine whether we can pay out in the future for accrued, but unused vacation.
1013	I think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confirm with Weil.
1013	Don't know about parking/bus.
1013	I think it is regular course, but we may have to change that regular course.
1014	Mary jean.
1014	Did you get ok from your partners to publish 401k info to public and employees?
1014	PR seems to think that Glen signed off on doing it.
1014	Michelle
1015	Happy to give them, but no reps are going to be made, as I understand.
1015	Michelle
1016	yes, I approved, after talking wtih Weil.
1016	Michelle
1017	all of them
1018	Hi, Randy.
1018	I hope you are doing ok.
1018	I thought you might be interested to learn that Victoria Sterling amended her lawsuit to add Enron as a party on Nov. 30.
1018	Of course, the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy, but it is interesting that she finally did it.
1018	Take care.
1018	Michelle
1019	How about 9 in my office on 3825?
1019	Did you add the sections on what we want newco to do for the employees?
1019	See you then.
1019	Michelle
1020	Great!!
1021	I will, subject to having the opportunity to review it.
1021	Thanks.
1021	Michelle
1022	Good morning.
1022	David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.
1022	We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.
1022	We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.
1022	We will need those segregated as follows: Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.
1022	Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations.
1022	EEL employees Employees remaining in the Enron estate.
1022	Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?
1022	I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.
1022	Thanks!!
1022	Michelle
1023	Maureen, as soon as I receive anything, I'll forward it on.
1023	I am working on it and have been since yesterday.
1023	Michelle
1024	No employment claims for gas or power.
1024	Michelle
1025	Don't give SSNs.
1025	I'd suggest giving names only.
1026	Are we agreeing to this?
1027	Given that this has not been communciated to current employees, I believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time.
1027	It strikes me as something that should be discussed at the management committee level, as that was the group that made this decision last summer.
1027	Michelle
1028	I'd transfer to ENA effective 1/1.
1028	If the people have employment agreements, we will need to assign.
1028	Michelle
1029	How does he want to change it?
1029	If it is more generous, then I think we should discuss.
1029	Michelle
1030	likely story
1031	lizzette has taken the lead on this immigration issue.
1031	thanks.
1031	michelle
1032	no, it looked suspicious, so I didn't open it.
1032	Fax is 713-646-3490.
1033	Yes, do a wire.
1033	Her check to IRS will bounce if we don't handle it today.
1033	Thanks.
1033	Michelle
1034	We are working through that issue this week.
1034	Michelle
1035	yes, we will.
1035	michelle
1036	Kalen, do we still have the disclaimer on these?
1036	I'd like to make sure that it appears on every set.
1036	Thanks.
1036	Michelle
1037	Go ahead and give her a call -- let's get it right, even if it causes a few minutes' delay.
1037	If anyone on this email knows how to contact her quickly, then have her give Mike Jones a call asap.
1037	Thanks.
1037	Michelle
1038	Bob, I am happy for you to handle the Richter matter.
1038	Lizzette Palmer on my team has been taking the lead on NEPCO matters, so get with her on details.
1038	I'll confirm with David Lund that he has no objection.
1038	Michelle
1039	I'm working on it.
1040	I'd send this to sarah and ryan for their database.
1040	Ill check around I have a good friend who works there.
1041	I assume the severance question is only going to former employees, wbut the doctor question goes to both current and former employees.
1041	Let me know if the plan is different.
1041	Michelle
1042	Have we assigned employees to netco?
1042	I didn't think we had.
1042	In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ena and have them hired by netco after closing.
1042	I am on blackberry and missed the end of the talking points.
1042	Could you resend?
1042	Thanks.
1042	Michelle
1043	in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation.
1043	We haven't made that decision here though.
1043	As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term.
1043	I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not.
1043	Let me know if you want me to check the latest version Michelle
1044	No. We think it may be payable as a past expense.
1044	Michelle
1045	Can you supplement the answer to the visa question?
1045	Thanks.
1045	Michelle
1046	who is handling reinstatement for ENA?
1047	David, I think we should remove anything relating to the components of a retention -- i.e., whether it is RS or cash -- and any thing relating to vesting.
1047	No way to predict at this time.
1047	As I have more comments, I'll send them on.
1047	Mich
1048	One other thing -- Texas law will apply to those employees in Texas, as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters.
1048	Oregon is the same.
1048	As I re-read, I found more references to vesting or payout dates.
1048	Again, these should be more generic or blank.
1048	Michelle
1049	Unfortunately, no.
1049	We have to get those approved by creditors here first.
1049	Bummer.
1049	Michelle Merry Christmas!

40	I do not see the link to "Statistical Database".
40	Do I need to request acceEnron North America Corp. From: Tracey Irvin 01/10/2000 08:03 PM
41	Thanks for your help.
41	There really are no material changes for Texas.
41	The only issue that I see is the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.
41	This was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).
41	Let me know if you have further questions.
41	Thanks, Eric
42	I left you a msg, but here is the info.
42	Call with questions.

51	No problem.
51	Enron North America Corp.
52	I'm old now, but i can always find solace in the fact that you are older!
52	I don't know yet if I am going to go out tonight, but if I do we'll probably go to Woody's on Richmond - it used to be the velvet Elvis
53	Your list of items is correct.
53	However, the entex related transport shows up on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.
53	This number is manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.
53	Therefore, this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.
53	Eric Enron North America Corp.
54	Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical.
54	Enron North America Corp.
55	I will be attending the lunch.
55	-Eric x3-0977
56	what time?
56	Enron North America Corp.
57	I'm feeling fantastic considering I slept till 8:30 this morning.

58	We stayed out until about 1:30 and then went home.
58	I'm going to start calling you "backout" if you don't shape up.
59	No news on Dec yet but Nov exposure is around ($1.6 mm).
59	Eric
60	He's doing ok.
60	He doesn't really like his job too much.
60	He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.
60	If not, he is applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.
60	I think he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am waiting to hear about that.
60	By the way, have you seen Enron's stock the last two days.
60	It has gone from 53 to 72.
60	It 's good to work for the big E!

61	We have actually already called Springer to get on his "Surprise, I'm dating your brother" episode.

61	There is not much going on this weekend on my end - I will probably take it easy.
61	And you?
61	Let me guess - you are going to try and stop by my place (that will happen)?
62	Attached is a listing of unresolved Issues between Tom and Greg Sharp.

69	The deal numbers and prices follow: Deal # Vol Swap Px Resulting Customer Px Let me know if this clears everything up.
69	Eric Enron North America Corp.
70	It looks like facility charges are covered 1/2000 forward by the individual deals.
70	Mick does not think there are any other outstanding issues for transport as a methodology has been established and agreed upon for 1/2000 forward.
70	Enron North America Corp.
71	count me in Enron North America Corp.

76	Thanks, Eric
77	Is Hill available for trade?
77	Let me know what on my team interests you.
77	-Eric
78	You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final P&L.
78	You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.
78	At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx.
78	$250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.
78	We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.
78	Therefore, the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.
78	I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of November.
78	-Eric
79	thanks for showing up to the party on sunday.

182	I don't know about meter 4486, but the other three are good.

183	Phil, Can you provide me with the most recent Entex Deferral Balance?
183	Thanks
184	Things are going well here.
184	I have been pretty busy losing lots of money at work.
184	Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the month, but I can't go because of work.
184	It doesn't bother me that much though.
184	I will probably try to take a trip over there in May.
184	On top of that I am thinking about a cruise this summer some time.
184	Brian and I are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the Park at Midtown.
184	Brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony, so we are going to move to an interior apartment.
184	Of course, I wouldn't expect you to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment.
184	Oh well, I guess you have your priorities.
184	Other than that, not a whole lot going on.
184	How are things with you and the
185	When is graduation?
185	And, of course I will show up.
185	Although, if I recall, you didn't show up for mine!
185	You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006.
185	I haven't heard of the advertising firm.
185	What kind of projects do they work on?
185	I am going to Earth Day.
185	Are you?
185	Are you bringing Rebecca again this year?
185	We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. Patty's day.
185	What about you?
186	Here is my bracket.
186	I will bring the money down around 10:30.
187	Market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in the wellhead portfolio.
187	I do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead portfolio.
187	However, I do not see a problem with the market deals unless they were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders).

188	Everything is working.
188	Thanks for the help.
188	Eric
189	FYI.
189	There might be some back office issues with this.
190	how was the well this weekend?
190	Enron North America Corp.
191	i have his marathon pictures up as wallpaper on my computer.
191	he is so sexy with his shirt off.
191	did you have a good weekend?
191	do you still want to get togehter after work sometime this week?
191	lemme know
192	Sorry about the headache.
192	I hear that slamming your head against the wall is good for getting rid of migraines.
192	Oh wait that's what I do at work to help me think about something other than losing lots of money - never mind.
192	Thurs is probably best then - if not then maybe next week.
193	I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.
193	I don't think you can make a case that you were smart for betting me without the points.
193	That's like me saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am confident that it is going to 90.
193	That's real smart.
193	No wonder EES loses money!
193	Enron North America Corp.
194	what sounds good.

195	Thanks, Eric
196	do you want me to go?
197	i will go if you want me to - does that sound familiar?
198	Luis, I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in early April.
198	So, I will try to schedule a practice.
198	Let me know when you are back.

223	Please let me know if you will be there.
223	Eric
224	Hey I just got your msg from friday.
224	I left at around three.
224	How was your weekend?
224	Did you make it to earth day?
224	Talk to you later.
225	Tonight's game has been cancelled
226	Dale, The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.
226	We already have a baseload Index Corpus product.
226	We need to create a DAY Corpus product with the same parameters as this baseload product.
226	Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?
226	Thanks, Eric
227	I don't know.
227	I haven't heard anything.
227	You might want to talk to superfan ( aka Chad)
228	what's up with the migraines?
228	that is two weekends in a row!
228	the concert was good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear black ballon and name - so i was happy.
228	i felt sick this weekend too - so mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.
228	I did get to go to a game at my new field (Enron).
228	It is a great place to see a ballgame.
228	You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and the Astrodome.
228	I left early on Friday b/c I am a shooter :) The Fam is great and Jason has not found a new job yet.
228	Phew!
228	I think I got all of them (the questions, that is).
229	The new product will be a day product like our current Katy and HSC Pool products, so it will be a fixed price product for next day gas delivered at the Corpus location.
229	Call with questions.
230	Did you make your reservation?
231	Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.
231	60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly basis.
231	Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.
231	For example: Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.
231	This means that: Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000 Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is ($520,000) Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000 of accrual value which had not been previously recognized.
231	Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.
231	Call with questions.
231	Eric
232	Hey, I tried to call you.
232	I need Brandi's Work #, Home # and Social Security #.
233	What do I look like - a key map?
233	Take Allen Parkway to Shepherd.
233	Make a right on Shepherd and a quick left on Memorial.
233	Follow Memorial all the way to the park.
233	I don't know which side you will play on b/c both sides have fields.
234	i will go
235	Jill, I was wondering if I could get some information on the Costilla deal, specifically the repurchase option.
235	I need to know the term, locations, volume and strike price of the call.
235	Thanks, Eric
236	There is not enough data on it to make an educated decision.
236	It looks like they have the backing of an I-bank to place some more stock so that is somewhat encouraging.
236	You are going to have to make your own call on this one.
236	If you like the idea and you think they can execute, then go for it.
237	That sounds good.
237	We will be there!
238	Melissa, Here are the accrual values for Q1.
238	More details to follow.
238	Feb- $289,305 Eric Enron North America Corp.
239	Melissa, Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.
239	Sharp's number is embedded within those.
239	His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo.
239	I will follow up with these specific details.
239	Eric
240	I don't think 5:15 is a great time for us, but don't let us keep you from going to the show.
240	If you want to go to the early show, we won't be offended.
240	We can do something another time.
240	We would love to do something with you if you decide against the 5:15 show.
241	No. I went last year and it was more packed than on a regular day.
242	Melissa, As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.
242	As a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly "accrual value" can be determined.
242	This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month.
242	The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals, actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.
242	Of the above, Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.
242	Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).
242	The breakout of this value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.
242	The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.
242	January- Total Accrual Value = $266,504 Greg's Value Tom's Value Evergreen Value = $140,750 Bid to Mid Accrual Value = $53,000 Accrual Costs Incorrect Marking = ($105,000) Total Value = $148,750 February- Total Accrual Value = $289,305 Greg's Value Tom's Value Evergreen Value = $145,000 Bid to Mid Accrual Value = $62,000 Accrual Costs Incorrect Marking = ($95,000) Total Value = $177,000 March - Total Accrual Value = $292,145 Greg's Value Tom's Value Evergreen Value = $147,000 Bid to Mid Accrual Value = $59,000 Accrual Costs Incorrect Marking = ($100,000) Total Value = $172,000 Let me know if you have any questions.

243	What I am really looking for is a way to save monthly production data by county for the entire state for all of the data.
243	Unfortunately, saving the data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time.
243	Thanks for your help.
243	Eric Bass
244	Hear is the info.
244	Let me know if you have any further questions.
245	Enron North America Corp.
246	Thanks for the information.
246	We are using it to try to get a sense of the increase in demand created by this new generation.
246	I have cross referenced some of your info with some info from the power desk.
246	this info is attached.
246	In addition, it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you mentioned below.
246	Please let me know when you can send the maps.

253	Tom Martin
254	Here is the wh data.
254	I have included the file for February only.
254	Keep in mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system accurately.
254	I have made top level adjustments to these deals.
255	i bet you score over 200!
256	55 - how about you?
257	liar
258	jesus.
258	you must have had sex with a cousin Enron North America Corp.

260	No problem.
260	I didn't go out last night - just had a quiet evening.
260	I am having a great day - work wise.

264	We had fun.
264	Shanna got sick, though, so we left around 1.
264	You?
265	Dale, On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.
265	Something like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC.
265	In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua Dulce hub.
265	Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.
265	Thanks for your help.
266	We need these locations set up to trade financial products for now.
266	We will be trading physical at Carthage but firmness is not a problem there.
266	Agua Dulce firmness may be a problem for physical, but as of now we are only going to trade it financially.
267	Here are the numbers Enron North America Corp.
268	he forgot the address sorry :( try bankrate.com
269	Any news?
269	we would like to trade that this bid week Thanks, Eric
270	We will trade this product every day, but we aim to start trading it this bid week, if possible.
270	Eric
271	Please let me know whether or not you will be there.
271	Please try to be there by 8:15.
272	Earl, James McKay referred me to you for information regarding historical throughput numbers on HPL.
272	Ed Gottlob and I are looking at ways to hedge the pipe and need this data as far back as can accurately be obtained.
272	Thanks, Eric
273	I really just need historical throughput, especially third party, to the major market areas.
273	I am going to analyze this data from a temperature correlation perspective to see if we can use weather derivatives to hedge throughput exposure.
273	Data as far back as can be pulled accurately would be helpful.
273	Call with questions.
273	Thanks, Eric Enron North America Corp.
274	I need a gas daily monthly index to be set up for both Carthage Hub and Agua Dulce Hub.
274	We will be trading basis swaps off of this differential.
274	Call with questions.
274	Thanks, Eric
275	there you go, i like being first on your list
276	i forget
277	ask mom
278	Sorry I didn't call you last night.
278	I didn't get home until 10 and brian was on the phone untill 11, so I figured you were asleep by then.
278	I'll give you a call later.
279	Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month ( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).
279	This value should not be given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.
279	There is a file in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility fees.
279	For further info contact Vance Taylor.
279	(the file is called fac costs) In addition, I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me regarding accrual value.
279	He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.
279	Could you check into this and get back to him?
279	Thanks, Eric Enron Capital Management

289	This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend delivery).
289	Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

297	why the hell were you invited?
298	i have to go to a work thing saturday night but i will be up for going out after dinner

300	we might get together a little earlier depending on the time of the TEXAS/lsu game!
300	and it is margaritas, babe!
301	i haven't heard anything, i am waiting to hear.
301	the reg season is over but we may have a tourney
302	Thanks.
303	I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep getting an error msg for length.

303	Thanks, Eric
304	That looks good, but I need an index based product for July for the HPL/HSX Pool (not the east pool) Thanks, Eric
305	we will make but won't be there till around 6:30 ish
306	let me know if you want me to bring something.
306	love
307	I don't need to talk shit about the game.
307	I will let the Longhorns do the talking for me on Saturday.
307	By the way, you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now.
308	It may not be rocket science, but not everyone can hack it.
308	Isn't that why you left the wholesale side of the business?
308	Besides somebody has to take up the slack for EES.
308	Let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your loss for the quarter, I'm sure I can spare some out of my book!
309	I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.
309	I would hate to have to come to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.
309	I guess I just had this opportunity fall in my lap because I never have added the kind of value that you did while in risk or EES.
309	I guess that is why I got offered a promotion to stay and you were sent packing to Enron Siberia.
309	P.S.
309	Shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend, maybe you can hook up!
310	You had to hit below the belt.
310	We were having a friendly shit talking contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.
310	What's up with that?
311	you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about the EES bullshit.
311	if it bothers you that much then say something about it.
311	as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.
311	i know that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.
311	i was just trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's lead.
311	and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought up the cfa.
311	i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.
311	so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat.
312	You're done, Hale is starting on Sat.
312	LSU doesn't stand a chance!
313	This reimbursement is for the CFA test.
313	I am in the analyst program, do I need to get my direct supervisor to sign off or get someone in the analyst program to sign?
313	Thanks, Eric
314	guess who sent me this!
314	it actually is pretty interesting to see how other companies value their analysts, though.
315	We are meeting at Chuy's at 7:00 tonight to celebrate Tim's 30th Birthday!

317	Crash and burn Louisville courtship of Rockets in jeopardy Associated Press HOUSTON * The bid by Louisville, Ky., to land the Houston Rockets appears to have fallen through.
317	Jefferson County in Kentucky on Monday declined to join a three-pronged proposal that would publicly finance a downtown basketball arena.
317	The plan suggested the city, county and state each issue up to $30 million in bonds to cover a portion of an arena that could cost $220 million.
317	The arena would be built to attract the Rockets or another professional basketball team.
317	Team officials visited with Louisville business and government leaders lastmonth.
317	The Rockets have also been in negotiations with Baltimore, New Orleaand St. Louis, but Louisville was the only city to publicly court the team.
317	City officials wanted to submit a proposal to the Rockets by Tuesday, but the county indicated it wasn't ready to participate in the plan, the Houston Chronicle reported Tuesday.
317	"Please do not issue any statements of commitment, or send a memorandum ofunderstanding at this time on behalf of the county," Jefferson County Judge/Executive Rebecca Jackson wrote in a letter that was delivered to Louisville Mayor David Armstrong.
317	The letter, dated Monday, was also signed by the county's three commissioners.
317	The Rockets declined comment on the development, but denied ever giving Louisville attorney J. Bruce Miller a deadline to submit a proposal.
317	Meanwhile Monday, about 35 protesters chanted "don't pick our pockets to pafor the Rockets!"
317	in front of the county courthouse in Louisville to protesspending public money on an arena.
317	The Rockets have been considering a move since November, when voters in Houston rejected a plan to build them a $160 million arena.
318	I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in Texas.
318	I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.
318	The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.
318	The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., natural gas, coal, etc.) Do you have this information?
318	Thanks, Eric

323	what does that mean?
323	Enron North America Corp.
324	what are you talking about?
324	Enron North America Corp.
325	Celeste, I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the program affect my eligibility for promotion.
325	At the end of last year you informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid year review (my 2 year anniversary).
325	It was my impression that the only reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure.
325	Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.
325	I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this PRC?
325	Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
325	Eric Bass
326	fitting story
327	all you need to do is input your notional positions in the yellow fields
328	It is coming up on that time again.
328	The most glorious time of year.
328	The time of the year when life begins anew.
328	No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!
328	That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.
328	I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.).
328	I was thinking about having the draft in late August.
328	Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.
328	-Eric

336	check out this site.
336	louise starts school aug 14, so if we all go it would have to be before then.
337	don't worry about it :)
338	hey, long time no hear!
338	how have you been?
338	how was the trip?
338	i had fantastic time on my cruise.
338	unfortunately, i got back on sunday and it was straight to work on monday.
338	i'm assuming you didn't take up permanent residence in Belize, so, if you didn't, drop me a line.
339	by the way we are going to see either the patriot or the perfect storm tonight - so decide!
340	i think this is a call for help.
340	maybe you should provide with some service tonight?
341	It looks like we have our 12 teams.
341	We will probably keep the same rules from last year unless anybody has an objection.
341	Still to be determined are league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.
341	I suggest that we draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.
341	For those of you that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.
341	We will be using cbs sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.
341	Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, too early, too late.
341	If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.
341	You all do not stand a chance!
341	-Eric
342	im thinking perfect storm
343	don't worry about it
344	what day is good for you?
345	There are some conflicts with the draft date, so we will probably need to have it on a different date.
345	Please tell me if you prefer 9/2 ( the day before the season starts) or 8/20.
345	We could also do it during the week, but it will probably takle 3 or 4 hrs.
345	Let me know suggestions.
346	Hector, I invitate you touch my big, beautiful, American breasts!
347	The new draft date is 8/20 by overwhelming majority.
347	Stay tuned for further details.
348	i told you so!
349	We have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for acquiring players.
349	Please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links to the auction ( I think it is Auctions A-Z) and let me know which option you think is better.
350	By popular vote, we will have a draft instead of an auction and the draft will take place on 8/20.
350	Rules to follow.
350	Eric
351	Michael, Wednesday afternoon after 3:00 would be good for me.
351	Let me know if this works for you.
351	Eric
352	Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.
352	Do you want to continue this Also, I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior to the draft.

364	you realize that who plove takes is irrelevant b/c your are going to take the best player available at either slot.
364	It is what you think you can make up with the additional picks.
364	besides, both of us are at equal risk to who plove picks

395	Thanks, Eric
396	here you go, tell me what you think.
396	i spent a lot of time on this
397	Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.
397	Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board off of a nearby fence, wedges it down the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving his friend's life.
397	A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to interview the boy.
397	"YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL" he starts writing in his notebook.
397	"But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies.
397	"Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed you were."
397	The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."
397	The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."
397	"Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an Arkansas State fan. You must be a University of Central Arkansas fan."
397	The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."
397	The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."
397	"Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you root for?"
397	the reporter asked.
397	"Why, I'm an LSU fan!"
397	the child replies.
397	The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."
398	I know that Christa sent an e-mail about this a couple of weeks ago, but I wanted to follow up.
398	Does anyone have any interest in going to Austin Friday night and then going tubing in New Braunfels on Saturday.
398	Let me know.
398	Forward this to anyone you think mught be interested.
398	-Eric
399	have you started building your model yet?
400	it doesn't look good for austin, how is your aunt?
401	We are going to have the draft on 8/20.
401	However, we still need to decide where and at what time.
401	I would prefer to have the draft around noon.
401	We can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the internet).
401	Please let me know ASAP.
401	-Eric
402	by popular vote, the draft will take place at noon on 8/20 at BW-3 in rice village.
403	alright, no more memos about bw3 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative.
403	matt, you won't be there, so your input is worthless bryan, two rows isn't conducive to big groups, so pick some place else.
404	Matt told me he is going to draft an lsu player with the first pick - Eddie
405	As Enron reaches new highs (82), I hope you took my advice to buy it at 74.
405	Did you?
406	i am doing great.
406	i am going to get my neck checked out again today ( i can't beilieve you gave me those faulty genes).
406	i am sure you know that toni woke up yesterday, she is cognizant and responsive but still can't speak or move.
406	i will keep you updated.
406	how are you?
406	love,
407	by the way, buy it now b/c it is going to 100 by year end.
408	i have not gotten a good response so i think shanna and i are going to stay in town.

409	you know that both o'neal and matt are out?

418	Thanks Steve.
419	thanks, again, for calling me back last night!
420	I am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order.
420	Some, have said that it is not fair for Steve to be handed the 6th slot.
420	Let me know what you think.
420	-Eric
421	did you buy enron this morning?
422	he probably doesn't want to redraw because he knows he can't possibly rip you off any more than he already has!
423	By popular vote, we will not redraw.
423	Our draft will take place, this Sunday at 11:45 am at BW-3 in Rice Village.
424	in order to counter offer, you must have had an offer.
424	if you remember, you offered me a lesser trade than that already my counter offer is 4,7,10 for your 2, 8
425	I will be at the dinner on Thursday.
425	Thanks, Eric
426	no ican't do that.
426	how about my 4 and 7 for your 2

432	how about the final pick in the 2nd and my third for your 2nd and your 4th
433	you might as well cut your losses.
433	you are not going to get over on someone as badly as matt got over on you.
433	so you might as well bite the bullet and make a trade that actually is good for your team
434	its called bargaining, how is me giving up a 2 and a 3 good for me?
434	Its not, I am trying to figure out what you are willing to take
435	i have to swing the other side of it , i'll let you know

443	shann started her new job today.
443	she is a little stressed about the increase in workload.
443	she is going to visit the family this weekend, so i have a weekend on my own.

455	Please try to be there on time so we can start promptly.
455	-Eric
456	I have inputted rosters and set schedules.
456	Please check you rosters!
457	What do you want for tony gonzalez?
458	i will give you walls and terrence wilkins
459	so, there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for, i find that hard to believe
460	i repeat, uou have no offer?
461	What do you want for Randy Moss?
462	so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo
463	your team is so bad
464	i thought we decided that was during the season - up until the season starts it is free.
465	since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better record than you this year
466	I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for free agents until the start of the season.
466	If you disagree, let me know.
466	The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.
466	You can have no more than 17 players on your roster at any time.
467	Your running backs suck.
467	I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman.
468	we will make it effective today so that, you can't stockpile players
469	How about Raymont, Bill Schroeder and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman?
470	What do you think?
470	chrebet,dillon
471	any counter?
471	Enron Capital Management
472	Alright, I think this is a good deal for you!
472	You get Depth at Receiver and Depth at Running Back.
472	Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith FOR Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith What do you think?
472	Enron Capital Management
473	Please take time to answer a new poll on the website!
474	What do you want for Fred Taylor - do you see he is out for the first 2 weeks?
475	Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play week 1 and maybe 2).
475	Let me know
476	What is your offer on marcus robinson?
477	Hear anything on Engram?
478	Hey Mom, The x-rays were negative, and i haven't heard about the review yet.
478	how is everything on your front?
478	love,
479	What Do you want for Engram?
480	for Kevin Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, and Bill Schroeder?
481	What do you want for Fred Taylor?
482	oh, because i was going to offer up stephen davis, but never mind ...
483	your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th best rb for the 30th receiver?
484	engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i might add) for a backup WR.
484	the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have a pretty good year.
484	by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.
484	so don't give me any of that
485	check this out another example of how ridiculous people are
486	i will give you schroeder and raymont harris.
486	that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb.
486	by the way engram was drafted in the eight round, so was harris, and schroeder was drafted in the 10th that is an 8 and a 10 for 8
487	some people are dumb asses
488	let me know what you think or if you have a counter
489	counter then
490	Raymont Harris, bill schroeder and wayne chrebet for smith
491	we had said we were going to vote on trades.
491	we have had our first trade.
491	some people have come to me requesting a vote please go to the website and vote on the trade between the the Lie Downs and the Rounders
492	i took the vote down, we will only vote on trades later in the year
493	you desperately need depth at rb - lamar smith is solid
494	jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent , they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got suspended.
494	if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.
494	so let me know
495	alright i would do davis,schroeder, and harris, for faulk and connell
496	didnt i just make you an offer for connell?
496	you are not going to get both dillon and davis so if you have to have both of them tell me so i can back out now but the trade i offered you is fair
497	ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package?
497	how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade that i think is fair for my team let me know what you think
498	i am still willing to do that side bet if you want
499	some people are idiots
500	check this out on my offer of schroeder and harris for engram
501	I sent that file to you in error.
501	Please disregard.
501	Thanks, Eric
502	you tell me that you are cheating on me .
502	.
502	.
502	.
502	interesting Enron North America Corp.
503	Mother, I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.
503	Both you and Dad replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious and there was no timeframe on its completion.
503	You know that I love you and Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your implication with your last comment).
503	If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to remember that my brother and I are different people.

623	I don't know what he is going to do.
623	I hope that they start Simms, not because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop.
623	Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of pride.
624	we have at least 8
625	By the way, wear your grey "HEAT" jerseys to the game and bring a blue t-shirt as an extra.
626	i think i can scrounge one up Enron North America Corp.
627	Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback By Len Pasquarelli SportsLine.com Senior Writer Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed.
627	"If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case," coach Norv Turner said.
627	"But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."
627	Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP) In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants.
627	The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games.
627	A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses.
627	He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change.
627	One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries.
627	The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 yards.
627	In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis.
627	The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 yards per catch this season.
627	But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter.
627	"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said.
627	"Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else."
628	please take me out of my bid for kennison
629	$2 bid for Marcus Pollard
630	what do you want for taylor?
631	that's great!
631	what do you want for taylor?
632	just to let you know - s.
632	davis is worth much more than taylor and m.
632	robinson is worth much more than george (even if george is starting).
632	garner and toomer for taylor
633	see the bottom for directions
634	Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack?
635	what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters?
636	alright then anderson rather than watters
637	walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?
637	that is the best i can do and that is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.
637	now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters, I need to know fairly quickly
638	have you decided?
638	I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!
638	Let me know
639	that bid won't be there next week :(
640	Did we ever decide on the whether to change to the owner's club or not?
641	If you want to pick up a player - you need to let me know by today - b/c I will be on vacation tomorrow.
642	I don't know, babe.
642	What did you get?
642	Enron North America Corp.
643	You can only pick up players for the upcoming sunday's game through the bidding process.
643	No pick ups will be allowed after wednesday on any given week.
644	I just now saw it.
644	It looks like a great gift (more from a daughter than a son).
644	I will look at it when it comes.
644	Enron North America Corp.
645	Here is the Room info for next week.
646	See Below:
647	Rob, The product descriptions look good.
647	Go ahead and move forward with the rest of the process.
647	Thanks, Eric
648	Sorry Brian, I am going to Austin this weekend.
648	Can we all get together for dinner sometime next week?
648	-Eric
649	Your WRs are terrible - let me help you out
650	I need your dues by COB today!
651	Anyone up for half price pizza tonight, say around 7:45?
651	And yes, I am a fat ass!
651	Let me know.
652	Let me know whether or not you can make it to the game on Wednesday @7.
653	here, woman!
654	Alright, you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him?
655	Plove is going to go to Dallas.
655	We are going to leave next Friday when he gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.
655	The game is at 11 in the morning, so we will come home directly after it.
655	Plove says he has a friend who has a place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.
655	Do you want to go?
655	-Eric
656	yeah, just come by my desk.
656	i have it for you.
657	Matt has a win and Harry a loss.
657	They tied but the win goes to the one with the most reserve points.
658	Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez?
659	George has no value after last weeks games - I will give you garner and
660	alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring back in the league) will still be there.
661	touchy, touchy.
661	if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good all year.
661	My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.
661	Let me know
662	your choice of anderson or watters and taylor
663	our game is at 7:00 tomorrow - can you make it?
664	Are you going to make tomorrow?
665	Thought you might be interested in this link for a beach vacation.
666	yep
667	Our game tonight is at 7:00.
667	Please try to make it by 6:30.
667	As of now we have eight people.
667	Tim - can you see if Micah can play again?
668	yeah, try to be there on time - preferably 6:30 - b/c we only have eight people
669	no, sorry
670	Horn for M. Anderson You are short WRs
671	you never responded to my last offer - Taylor and Anderson or Watters for Garner and Freeman?
672	and i will throw in beasley
673	I found something that New Orleans has to offer that Houston doesn't .
673	.
673	.
674	Are we done?
675	After the weekly bidding process is finished, you can complete all transactions on the website.
676	Since most were out of town last weekend, we were thinking of celebrating Brian's birthday again tonight at The Cheesecak Factory at 7:00.
676	Let me know if you will be able to attend.
676	-Eric
677	are you serious?
677	i just talked to you 5 minutes ago
678	If only we had your camaro to cruise in .
678	.
678	.
679	Is this some scam foundation that you have set up so that you can retire early...
679	I know how these things work, I've been around the block.
679	Seriously though, I will be happy to contribute.
679	-Eric
680	My deal on the other side fell through - so what do you think about Garner, Toomer, and Schroeder for Terrell and Rice
681	I forgot, I offered you Toomer and Garner for Terrell and Jackson - if you still want to do that then that is fine - if not look at the deal below.
682	can't do it - for one I don't have curtis martin and for two fred taylor has no value right now - propose something for someone I have
683	Our game is at 7:00 this week.
683	We play the other Enron team.
683	Please let me know whether or not you will attend.
684	our football game is at 7 - sorry
685	yep
686	I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate this), Applewhite should play.
686	I think if Applewhite plays and we have a decent running game, we can blow them out.
686	Our defense is good enough to shut pretty much anyone down.
686	When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there?
687	yes, it will be there all season
688	Hi Mom - I got your e-mail yesterday.
688	Shanna wasn't offended by your poignant political comments, she just knows, in no uncerain terms, that your are Republican and are going to vote for Bush.
688	Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.
688	I will pay the late fee the next time I rent a movie.
688	How are things otherwise?
689	home 713-526-8304 cell 713-628-3104 You are going to leave the big E?
689	Why?
689	Where are you going to work?
690	Jason seemed excited about the concert.
690	I think this is one of his favorite bands.
690	I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest sibling.
690	I am actually going to Dallas on Friday for the TX-OU game.
690	I am taking a couple of friends from work, so it should be a good time ( it always is).
691	I need to place a $0 bid for Steve Christie and a $0 bid for Wade Richey.
691	Thanks
692	3 of us are going up Friday and we are staying with a friend of one of the guys in the group.
693	in
694	Are you coming to the game tonight?
695	do you want to go beat the crap out of some OU fans in Dallas this weekend?
696	congrats on the new position - I just heard Enron North America Corp.
697	What did you think of the debate?
697	I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself.
697	Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.
697	Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".
697	That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard- I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.
697	So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.
698	$0 for centers
699	Just a reminder.
699	Please try to be at the field by 6:30.

709	What, you tear down the goal posts because you beat the #11 team in the country?
710	What are we going to do for your 80th?
710	I have Friday off - so maybe we can get together for dinner on Thurs?
711	the most pitiful excuse for a football game that I have ever seen.
711	Greg Davis needs to be fired and the young players need to play, i.e. Roy Williams and BJ need to play more than just on third downs.
712	Let me know whether or not you will come.
713	who, the aggies, longhorns, or heat?
714	Are you up for a little Golden Tee on Friday?
715	We need a couple of extra players tonight.
715	Luis - do you have a friend that can play?
715	Brian - can you ask Lenny to play?
716	Can you lower my bid to $26 for A. Denson?
717	McNown and Toomer for Horn and Culpepper

718	Go get her ,TIGER!

721	How were the flowers?
721	Exotic?
721	I didn't get to see a live picture of them because they were too exotic?
721	-Eric
722	That's no fun :(
723	We got another big name recruit - that will probably amount to nothing with our conservative, shitty Offensive Coordinator.
724	in - they were all fair trades
725	You are all just envious of the relationships that I have develped with the other fantasy owners, that enable me to help improve both teams through trade
726	Plove is just running his mouth because he can't cover me!
726	(Remember how I kept burning you and those deep passes?)
727	Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will not show up.
727	So, let me know whether or not you will be there.
728	I am glad to see your expertise put to good use:)
729	Not really, but some of the others do :)
730	besides - you weren't the only one that wasn't there last week
731	I though this link was pretty funny and sick at the same time.
731	When a drug dealer is compared to the US president, you know we have problems!
732	Are we really going to stay at the shithole hotel in Vegas or are you going to get rooms at the Bellagio?
733	I don't remember being part of this vote.
733	And who says that this is a democracy?
734	We can go out this weekend
735	can't make it - i'm sick
736	Gary, We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell.
736	Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as possible.
736	However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts, this is probably an unrealistic goal.
736	I will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target.
736	Thanks, Eric
737	$0 bids for S Christie, G Anderson, and D Akers $2 bid for Kevin Johnson $0 bid for Torrance Small Thanks
738	This is to those of you who can make the game tonight.
738	Please try to get to the game as early as possible (6:15-6:30) so we can practice a little.
738	We should have eight pending Luis' friend.
738	Let me know if anything comes up between now and game time that we prevent your attendance.
739	time to break out some of the old plays?
740	yeah, you can bring him - it wouldn't hurt to have another guy
741	Jason, I'd like to help you out this month but I just made a big expenditure on an exercise machine myself.
741	So, it will have to wait until at least next month.
741	Sorry
742	Rison is on Gary's team - but is listed as a free agent due to my error - you can pick up another WR for free if you need one.
742	Sorry Enron Capital Management
743	If you have players playing in tonight's game (det v TB) you need to put them in your lineup tonight
744	put it in the system Enron Capital Management
745	To whom it may concern: In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.
745	I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.
745	In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community.
745	With these two things in mind, I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.
745	I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.
745	This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.
745	My questions are : Is this idea plausible?
745	If so, who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament?
745	Thanks in advance, Eric Bass
746	Hey Michael, I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.
746	I know you have already talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on that team.
746	Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the championship.
746	Hook 'em.

760	I have been looking at some restaurants on telluride.org - it looks like they have some nice places.

794	SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.
794	After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
794	The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
794	So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice.
794	At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.
794	He proceeded to talk up a storm.
794	Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door: 1.
794	Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
794	2.
794	There are 10 commandments, not 12.
794	3.
794	There are 12 disciples, not 10.
794	4.
794	Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
794	5.
794	Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
794	6.
794	We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. 7.
794	The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
794	8.
794	David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
794	9.
794	When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.
794	10.
794	We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
794	11.
794	When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."
794	He did not say, Eat me" 12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry," 13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. 14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's. The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on. The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter. Do not send money. Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck. You will see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.

795	A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.

807	here is a template for some plays - it might be helpful to have a list of plays to show during the game
808	look at sheet 2
809	I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our plays from our flag football league.
809	There are plays on both tabs.
809	I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.
809	Let me know if you have objections.
809	Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).
809	Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let me know.
809	Let me know what you think.

810	Hey Dad, Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery.
810	What is the skinny?
810	Is this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed?
810	How are things otherwise?
810	Love,
811	we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are more open.
811	you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.
811	what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow?
812	Hey Paul, I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.
812	The tourney starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.
812	If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game (2 for each of us).
812	Let me know if you are interested.
812	Thanks, Eric
813	did you get mauricio to play?
814	I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what hit them.
814	So I will draw up some plays.
814	What do you think?
815	Updated plays.
815	I have copied both sheets on 1 page (front and back).
816	how was the surgery - do you need any prosthetics for your birthday?
817	Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.

817	Have you been skiing before?
817	-Eric AM
818	Good to finally hear from.
818	Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
818	Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn football team.
818	It seems as though they are improving, however.
818	Hopefully we will be playing for the National Championship next year.
818	How are things otherwise?
818	When are you coming into town again?
818	Later- Eric
819	I can do the tv but I am busy all weekend so, if I can do it next week let me know.
819	I might be able to squeeze it in on Saturday b/c I will be out that way.
819	On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in Dallas?
820	Do you have any additions because I am going to take the plays to kinkos and get them laminated?
821	Anyone up for Keneally's after work today?
822	its probably going to rain so that is why the lamination
823	what about smu area?
824	my bro says this place is nice but don't know how expensive
825	This is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to downtown and near greenville - another bar area).
825	Might be a little more expensive but probably worth it.
826	i'm not a big prince fan - she might want to though

852	Dan, I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL "Force Majeure" language.
852	Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?
852	Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones.
852	I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.
852	Thanks in advance.

858	i see east carolina but i don't see teetee; it doesn't bode well for the gallery furniture bowl
859	Dan, Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?
859	Thanks, Eric

874	Do you have the original flight information on our flight out of houston?
874	Thanks
875	I thought you all might find this an interesting read.
875	Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help.
875	To whom it may concern: I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.
875	It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.
875	I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).
875	Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.
875	I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions.
875	There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.
875	Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.
875	Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.
875	Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have delivered us to Phoenix on time.
875	It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
875	I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.
875	Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.
875	This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.
875	Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.
875	For your research I provide the following data: Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna Husser, and Donnita Franklin.
875	Final Itinerary (after all changes) - Sincerely, Eric Bass

904	that sounds fine - but the zoo is in balboa park as well Enron North America Corp.
905	tom is going to be happiest with more money - so whatever nets him more money he will be happy with Enron Capital Management
906	Have you decided on plans for New Years?

910	I was wondering if ya'll wanted to have a happy hour on Friday for Tim and Louise in honor of their recent engagement.
910	Do you have any ideas on places to go?
910	Let me know
911	great game .
911	.
911	.
911	terrible result.
911	i can't really be dissappointed the play of simms or the WRs (dropped passes).
911	the defense was very dissappointing
912	in
913	in Enron North America Corp.
914	unfortunately i don't think tha louise would appreciate that too much considering she is in town and will be attending.
914	so how about kenneally's or
915	Wilkerson is the number 3 prospect in the country at lineman behind Johnathon Scott a commitment of guess who - Texas.
915	Wilkerson Scott
916	Oh yeah, and by the way here are the rankings .
916	.
916	.
917	i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu.
917	.
917	.
917	.
917	texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the game.
917	oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite.
917	that means that texas should be national champions.
917	get real .
917	.
917	.
917	one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make.
917	our team did the same thing right after mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same next year.
917	lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.
917	but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.
918	i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is actually better than them.
918	see below
919	So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else.
920	too complicated Enron Capital Management
921	I was thinking about taking Brenda to lunch on the 12th of Jan. Let me know if you are interested in coming.
921	If that date does not work for you, we can go some other day.
921	-Eric
922	Brenda, I know that I have mentioned a lunch several times and have finally gotten around to coordinating it (thanks, Dave).
922	How does Friday, Jan. 12.
922	sound?
922	-Eric
923	well?
923	Enron North America Corp.
924	It looks like Thursday is fine.
924	So, how about we meet in the lobby at 11:30.
924	Let me know.
924	-Eric Enron North America Corp.
925	Let me know if you are coming.
926	oh - i invited your rocket power dancer friend.

927	you can invite others if you want
928	not yet but i will let you know
929	i went ahead and forwarded your msg to tim - although i already told him that the 16 yr old was invited - he didn't like that too much
930	yeah why
931	i was planning on watching at home.
931	are you going to watch it somewhere?
932	Now I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through cheating.
932	You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.
932	A designated IR player cannot play.
932	There are no IR moves during the week.
932	That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each week.
932	out
933	How many 1 way tickets do you have?
933	I am interested in buying in bulk!
933	Thanks, Eric Bass
934	Well I am looking for 24 Round trip tickets (48 one-ways) and was looking to spend around $200 per round trip ($100 for each one-way).
934	What is your offer on that size?
934	Thanks for you PROMPT attention because I am trying to book airfare today on one airline or another.
935	Hey Mom, Things are well.

935	Other than that, just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation.
935	How are things on the homefront?
936	I'm up for going to watch it somewhere.
936	Give me a call on my cell phone tonight or tomorrow - 713-628-3104.
937	I am not a market maker in SWA vouchers, so you have my word that I will not sell them back.
937	Your bid for these vouchers is $250 in the market, my bid for bulk is $200, I am willing to pay more.
937	I can already get to my destination for $250 - so maybe we can meet in the middle.
937	Let me know
938	shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow, so she will not be alone.
938	tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year when i first started.
938	he had been dating his fiancee during college but they had broken up about a year ago.
938	he had been trying to get back together but i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.
938	i guess he had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went well over christmas he went ahead.
938	have a fun and safe weekend.
939	Hey Dad, We would love to meet ya'll for dinner.

941	I made a few changes.
941	Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better (preferably fitting on one page).
941	So most of my changes have been consolidations.
941	Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet points the same (you want to do this on all resumes and outlines).
941	As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner on Friday at Pappasitos.
941	Can you make it?

1034	Can you give more info?
1035	I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low ball contract).
1035	This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.
1035	Let me know when you are available to see more houses.
1035	I am free whenever, except for Saturday after around 4 pm.

1129	Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.
1129	Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to supply you with some of the guidelines.
1129	-Bass Enron North America Corp.
1130	Brett, Just thought I'd drop you a line.
1130	Cool site, I guess you have too much spare time on your hands.
1130	Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.
1130	I am trading gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times (lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.
1130	Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to Ft.
1130	Sill.
1130	Do you get to see each other much?
1130	Where are you currently stationed?

1142	Here is our detail for October.
1142	Unfortunately we are unable to provide you with blanket counterparty level detail on our transactions due to legal issues.
1142	However, just as last month, if you have specific questions on any location or transaction, we can examine those on a case by case basis.
1142	Thank you.

1144	we are heading over to the Front Porch after work today for some drinks if you would like to join.
1144	-Eric

1145	it was good to see them again.
1145	i am anxious to see how we play against OU.
1145	i am starting to have a good feeling about this team.
1145	they looked really sharp on saturday - especially the offense.
1145	shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday.

1145	see ya then

1155	you need to have your transactions in by noon thursday
1156	i don't have any tickets sorry.
1156	are you going to make it up there and try to scalp some?
1157	go ahead and put it in the add/drop on the website and i will go through them at noon.
1158	it goes by record then points
1159	sorry no tkts.
1159	it was a good game though
1160	hey mom, thanks for the info.
1160	tough break for rush.
1160	i was sorry to hear about that.
1160	things are going well.
1160	just kind of slow.
1160	i have my asthma test today - it is called a pulmonary function test.
1160	what do you want to do for your birthday.
1160	do you want ot get together on friday or saturday and where?
1160	let me know
1161	hey sheila, thanks for the invite.
1161	my mom's b-day is this friday as well.
1161	i still don't know if we are taking her out on friday or saturday.
1161	so we will try to make it.
1161	we stayed at the marriot at the capital last year in austin.
1162	no .
1162	.
1162	.
1162	you are going to go dancing with me!
1163	that sounds great.
1163	i am always interested in a free meal.
1163	friday night is probably better for us if you guys want to come into town.
1163	if not, then saturday is fine.
1164	not my fault - like i knew that jamal was going to blow out his knee - i didn't offer terrell davis.
1164	what do you want for torry?
1165	ok alstott and troy brown for holt?
1166	alright what do you want for warrick dunn?
1167	moulds for alstott?
1168	what do you want for eddie?
1169	supposedly i have "reversible airway disease" which is not asthma but similar.
1169	they have given me an inhaler and some claritin (for allergies).
1169	i haven't been able to find anything on the internet about it though.
1170	maybe this is it?
1171	whatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.
1171	i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.
1171	instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.
1171	now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do.
1171	but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!!
1171	so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....
1172	i think i am going to bail on happy hour.
1172	shanna isn't feeling well.
1172	but plan on coming by my place for the game on sunday.
1173	Are we going to plan one for Dec?
1174	i have yet to get my cipro.
1174	when i get a spare $700 i will run out and get some.
1174	keep me posted on the trip.
1174	i probably need to plan it soon so that i can plan for vacation time.
1174	love,
1175	just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that my new e-mail address is eric.bass@enron.com.
1175	hope all is well
1176	due to the early game this week, please have your add/drops in the system by noon tomorrow (wednesday).
1176	thanks,
1177	we have eaten at urbana, ibiza, and masraffs.
1177	i have heard good things about zula and benjy's ( benjy's can get crowded though)
1178	how about highlands lodge for Dec 13 for 5 nights?
1178	it says something about buy one night get one free
1179	i just found that you could stay at highland lodge for 4 nights starting dec 13 and receive 4 lift tkts for that time period for $1600 total.
1179	that is not bad ehh?
1180	sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.
1180	as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.
1180	i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.
1180	i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.
1180	i might just sell now and look to buy back lower.
1180	let me know what you think
1181	new orleans was fun.
1181	the wedding was nice and it was good to get away for the weekend.
1181	how was your weekend?
1181	as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.
1181	i think in the short term we will definately see the teens.
1182	i doubt it - he usually shops in town for his
1183	i'll ask
1184	Do you still think that Colorado is going to win straight up?
1185	I have some good news and some bad news.
1185	The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.
1185	The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.
1185	So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.
1185	Sorry guys
1186	Any news?
1186	Which night do you want to get together?
1187	sounds good - i will make the reservations for sat.
1187	is 7 o'clock ok?
1188	the card was though :0)
1189	7 o'clock it is - see you then.
1190	redwood grill!
1191	that is good to hear.
1191	i was driving through west u last night and saw quite a few.
1191	i hit a couple of kids so i figure that netted me a few points.
1191	i look forward to seeing you on saturday love,
1192	Anybody up for happy hour after work?
1192	I was thinking Kenneally's at around 5.
1192	Let me know
1193	thought you might be interested
1194	no problem - thanks for joining us.
1194	we enjoy spending time with you guys.
1194	love,
1195	tkts are hard to come by but its looking like we can get in to the game - sect 144 row 25
1196	I am taking friday off - Do you want to together for some golf?
1197	that's fine ditch me for another tourney.
1197	but i undsertand you have to find alternative forms of income with enron's recent performance.
1197	the greatest football team in college history plays kansas on saturday
1198	I got your card.
1198	Thanks for joining us on Saturday night.
1198	Shanna and I always enjoy your company.
1198	Love,
1199	no special occassion really, just burning vacation.
1199	i have 12 days left.
1199	whats going on in your world?
1200	that sounds good - i am taking that friday off.
1200	the mood is pretty somber around here today.
1200	love,
1201	i agree with your comments about managament.
1201	it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights.
1201	i have bought some more shares today.
1201	my view is that the company will not fold.
1201	the worst case scenario is a buyout.
1201	so, it seems like we should bottom out shortly.
1201	right?
1201	good news on uncle george
1202	what is your logon and password for the-university - i am having some problems with mine thanks,
1203	i'm fine nothing new to report other than the stuff in the news.
1203	i think everything will work out
1204	Anybody up for happy hour at Ruggles Enron Field after work?
1205	i thought it was ruggles DY-ENRON Field
1206	so now that we have had this witty banter back and forth - is anyone coming to happy hour?
1207	what is jason's phone # at work and at home?
1208	we are going to happy hour at Ruggles Enron - dynegy Field after work.
1208	any interest?
1209	we'll be there all night
1210	you are welcome to invite chance and anyone else down there
1211	change of plans.
1211	we are going to front porch.
1211	so meet up if you can/want
1212	what do you think?
1213	you don't care
1214	Brian.
1214	Things are pretty hectic right now.
1214	There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.
1214	Dynegy acquired Enron (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.
1214	Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.
1214	I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.
1214	Of course, now that Enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.
1214	Good luck on finals and keep in touch.
1214	Your Pal, Eric
1215	i like it - how much?
1216	he should have been
1217	you are weird
1218	what's up?
1218	things are pretty hectic here.
1218	you lucked out by getting out of dodge.
1218	are you still coming to see the 2001-2002 nat'l champs on T+1?
1219	i think things will be ok at enron.
1219	it is pretty depressing right now though.
1219	how is school for you?
1219	just to let you know - i got seats on the 40 yd line for the game.
1219	right now it is going to be me, you, matt lenhart, and my dad.
1219	i will be out of the office next tuesday and wednesday.
1219	so give me call at work before then or you can call me on my cell (713)-628-3104 or at home (713)661-2601.
1219	let me know
1220	that sounds good.
1220	i will see you then
1221	don't you feel better about the whole situation now?
1222	all i can say is "house of cards"
1223	do you have msn messenger set up ?
1224	i will let you know over thanksgiving
1225	yeah why dont you set it up under start - programs- system utility applications - msn messenger and do the exchange system
1226	interesting .
1226	.
1226	thanks for the update
1227	If wanted to play golf at sugar creek next wed, can I get on without you and how much does it cost?
1228	we would love for you to join us.
1229	I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.
1229	This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.
1229	So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.
1229	The cost should be around $30-40 a person.
1229	Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.
1229	-Eric
1230	they won't be playing but they will be tied up to a post for our enjoyment
1231	hey dave - we are on for noon tomorrow.
1231	i will try to make it out to your house tomorrow.
1231	i have to go pick up the clubs at the parents house.
1231	so give me directions.
1231	by the way, my dad offered to buy us all lunch at sugar creek so, lets try to meet up a little early.
1232	That sounds great.
1232	I will be able to make it.
1232	Thanks, Eric
1233	but you will only go if charlie goes?
1234	you are one sick fuck
1235	volumes are still down - i have no clue on the merger.
1235	you hear something new each day
1236	do you have any big 12 tkts?
1237	i am just kidding - just giving you a hard time.
1237	i think i am going to sit this one out anyways.
1237	that was a tough loss for you guys
1238	hey.
1238	long time no hear.
1238	how is everything going with you?
1238	how is the family doing?
1238	Eric
1239	my family is doing really well.
1239	jason is getting married in february in fairfield.
1239	he seems very happy.
1239	things are a little sketchy at enron right now with the debacle that has occured, but everything should work out for the best.
1239	don't worry about all of that stuff, you can do what you please with it.
1240	i thought you were back in houston for good as of the last time we talked (8 mos. ago)?
1240	did you leave after that?
1240	where are you working now?
1240	i will relay your msg to jason
1241	where are you working now - i know you worked for that motorcycle company - do you still work there?
1241	jason's fiancee (sorry no fancy accent) had been a friend of his for awhile.
1241	They started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 6-7 months ago.
1241	She is very nice and we get along just fine.
1241	Thanksgiving was good - I stayed out at the the parents house for a couple of days and went up to college station on friday for the game.
1241	How about you?
1241	Glad to hear that Lucky is well.
1242	Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.
1242	I think the line is Texas -9.
1242	Let me know.
1243	FYI- since you didn't take care of business
1244	that sounds good 9 it is.
1244	we will go for beers regardless
1245	as we talked about yesterday, i am still at enron.
1245	while i have a job, i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments.
1245	i am living off of newcastle and 59 in the Gables Pin Oak.
1245	it is very nice - especially since i don't have a roommate any more.
1245	glad to hear that the family is doing well what are you doing at your new job?
1245	accounting?
1245	what about the firls - what are they doing?
1246	Hey Brett, What's been happening?
1246	I hope you didn't buy any enron!
1246	It is looking good for the Horns.
1246	It seems like fate is on their side.
1246	Every week we get closer to a Rose Bowl berth.
1246	If we get to the Rose Bowl I will have a ticket with your name on it if you can get away.
1246	Are you going to be able to catch the game this weekend?
1246	BTW, are you still in Hawaii?
1246	Hope all is well.
1246	Your Pal, Eric
1247	what is your commission?
1248	then you are done
1249	sounds like a good job.
1249	i am glad you are enjoying it.
1249	i haven't taken any big vacations lately, mostly to austin.
1249	i did go to new orleans for a wedding recently but other than that nothing.
1249	the girls sound like they are well.
1249	tell them i said "hi".
1249	good talking to you
1250	go ahead and buy on that news.
1250	you know its going to be bullish!!!
1251	whatever you think - just let me know
1252	are you telling me that you want me to buy and you will pay me back?
1253	thats fine just let me know what i owe
1254	thought you might enjoy
1255	Also, in bankruptcy, who is the first to be paid?
1255	Specifically, are employees first in line?
1255	Thanks
1256	thanks for the offer.
1256	i think some guys at work are going to get drinks today.
1256	you are welcome to join if you like.
1256	if not, i will take a rain check on your offer.
1257	Tom (my boss) does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus, but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down.
1257	He did, however, tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by Enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company.
1257	What do you think?
1257	_Eric
1258	Hey Brett, Good to hear from you.
1258	It is pretty bad at Enron.
1258	I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.
1258	The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.
1258	The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.
1258	It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.
1258	Oh well, things will work out.
1258	As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.
1258	Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the Rose Bowl this year).
1258	The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).
1258	If either one loses (Miami at Virginia Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.
1258	Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.
1258	This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.
1258	Good luck on the proposal.
1258	You are about to venture to the Dark Side.
1258	Telluride should be fun.
1258	We went there last year for a ski trip (again).
1258	I might be venturing down that path soon.
1258	I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).
1258	Take Care.
1258	Eric
1259	I don't have your work #.
1259	What is it?
1260	You are invited to join in the excitement of Texas in the Big XII Championship game this Saturday at 7 PM at my apartment.
1260	We will provide the food.
1260	Let me know if you guys are interested.
1260	My apartment is at 4848 Pin Oak Pk.
1260	#1503 Houston 77081.
1260	goto mapquest.com for directions.
1260	-Eric
1261	you are a dick!
1262	I got the cashiers check for the full amount and deposited it at Fidelity.
1262	I am just waiting for it to post to my account now.
1263	A friend and I were debating about payroll in a bankruptcy type situation.
1263	I said that there were no guarantees with regards to payroll until the courts approve it.
1263	He said that payroll was an administrative expense and therefore should be guaranteed?
1263	What do you think?
1264	you are an asshole !
1265	and where did you see that?
1266	i doubt they will show
1267	sure.
1267	have you decided on what you would like us to bring?
1268	that is nice to hear.
1268	i will look forward to speaking with her.
1269	Hey, How are things going with you guys?
1269	We really enjoyed Saturday night out at the house.
1269	We should get together more often.
1269	How is Mr. Hamilton doing ?
1269	I was thinking of sending some flowers to either the hospital (if he is out of ICU) or the house.
1269	Can you give me the address of either?
1269	Love,
1270	Harry, Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.
1270	Things are so bad at work right now.
1270	I have nothing to do whasoever.
1270	I get in to work around 9 am and leave around 12:30 every day.
1270	I hope all is going well in the job search.
1270	I saw your add/drop request for the Pats.
1270	If you want me to add the Steelers as well just let me know.
1270	Also, you might want to practice, "Would you like to SuperSize that?"
1270	-Eric
1271	trying to gauge interest for a get together at my place for the saints tonight.
1271	let me know
1272	that is fine with me
1273	that is disgusting - you are a pervert
1274	Linked to this e-mail is a spreadsheet that breaks down weekly pool winnings and the playoffs.
1274	Let me know if I have screwed something up.
1274	-Eric
1275	do you want me to book this or what?
1276	which al's formal wear?
1277	Now keep in mind that you have $2300 to spend via me.
1277	If you want to pick up the incremental cost yourself then I will book it and you can reimburse.
1277	Or you have two options, you can remove the travel insurance to lower the cost to you or you can book for one less night.
1277	Let me know.
1278	I booked your honeymoon.
1279	i changed it
1280	No problem.
1280	Thanks for playing.
1280	Hopefully we can keep in touch and have the same people next year.
1280	I will be settling the league up shortly and will send you a check.
1280	How are things going otherwise?
1280	-Eric
1281	Hey Joe, Tom said you were looking for Missy's and Donnie's numbers.
1281	Missy is 502-327-1406.
1281	I think you already talked to Donnie.
1281	I hope your holidays went well.
1281	-Eric
1282	what do you think about this.
1282	and you still need to send me a list of invitees (with e-mail) and the date of the party.
1283	my address 4848 Pin Oak Pk #1503
1284	Congrats on the engagement.
1284	Sounds like a great evening.
1284	I hope your holidays went well otherwise.
1284	Sorry I didn't get to see ya.
1284	Next time perhaps.
1284	-Eric PS I hope you caught the Holiday Bowl - the best game I have seen in awhile.
1285	you need to forward the invite to your buddy that you didn't provide me with e-mail
1286	The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.
1286	Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.
1286	So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party.
1286	The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.
1286	I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).
1286	The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.
1286	Let me know which one you would prefer.
1286	I personally prefer the better dinner.
1286	Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.
1286	The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.
1286	Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.
1286	-Eric
1287	i haven't really thought of that yet.
1287	i guess i will wait on the response that i get.
1288	hey brian, the holidays were good.
1288	it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work.
1288	how were your's?
1288	and how is the job search going?
1288	i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league.
1288	i think that you get 25% of the pot for 2nd place.
1288	the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.
1288	how do you think they will be next year?
1288	oh well, i hope things are going well.
1288	lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon.
1289	you owe $80 for the league.
1289	$120 for dues minus $40 for winning the league pool one week.
1289	do you agree?
1290	your net payout is $224.50 how do you want me to get the check to you?
1291	Hey Harry, How are things?
1291	Have you found a job yet?
1291	I trust the holidays went well for you.
1291	Anyways, I have a check for $74 for FFL - where can I send it?
1291	-Eric
1292	actually- i forgot to take the $40 out- so $184.50
1293	Hey Brian, Long time no hear.
1293	How are things at Harvard?
1293	I trust you had a good holiday period.
1293	Are you still in Kentucky or back in Boston?
1293	How was the first round of finals?
1293	Things are good down here.
1293	I stayed in Houston for the holidays.
1293	I still have a job.
1293	The big date for us (in the trading group) is this Friday.
1293	That is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group.
1293	Hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that.
1293	I really have done now work for the past 2 months.
1293	Mostly just sitting around and researching mutual funds and doing crossword puzzles.
1293	I have been coming in to work around 9 and leaving at about 2 everyday.
1293	What oral surgeon did you go to to get your wisdom teeth out?
1293	Tim needs to get his out and was wondering if you recommended the surgeon that did yours?
1293	Drop me a line when you get a chance.
1293	-Eric
1294	I still haven't heard from you guys regarding the Bachelor Party.
1294	Let me know
1295	We are going to Lil' Papasito's with some friends on Friday.
1295	Just wanted to know if you wanted to join us.
1296	Hey Mom, Things are going well.
1296	I heard you guys had a good time at the shower.
1296	I don't know Michael's address but I will get it.
1296	When are we going to get together?
1296	-Eric
1297	Do you want to go to dinner on Friday with us and some friends.
1297	Lil' Papasitos on Kirby.
1298	I have not heard back from tommybomb or scott re: your bachelor party.
1298	Maybe you would like to try them to see if they are going.
1298	I need to book the cruise ASAP though.
1298	So let me know.
1299	Here is the info: Mar 10-14 Caesars Tahoe Pkg rate is $300 for the first two nights and $172 for each additional night so - $644 total for 4 nights.
1299	The Pkg includes two lift tickets per day (3 total per person), voucher for the use of the spa daily, 2 daily brucnh buffets This is for the Regular Room Regular rate for regular room is $79/night Regular Rate for Jacuzzi Room is $89/night Sun through Tues and $145 for Wed the regular rates do not include anything but the room Airfare Continental offer nonstop for $370/person - flight time is 3.5 hours Other airlines offer 1 stop service for $275/person - flight time is 7 hours Let me know when you decide -Eric
1300	I forgot to mention that if you do not buy the pkg then lift tickets are about $55/person per day.
1300	I think we will probably just book the room and worry about the lift tickets ourselves.
1301	Alright last e-mail: We got clarification on the rooms.
1301	The Pkg deal stays the same but if you want to get just the room with 2 breakfasts each day it is $79/night - if you want the Premium Room ( the only difference is that the Premium room has jets in the tub) then it is $103/night with no breakfast $115/night with breakfast.
1302	Mom said you needed it: Houston, Texas, 77019
1303	Hey Dad, Did you get the link I sent on the Def Ann?
1303	If so, what do you think?
1303	Is there anything I missed?
1303	I am still waiting on a couple of RSVPs for the bachelor party so I will let you know on the transport.
1303	How are things otherwise?
1304	I haven't heard back form Tom yet, but everyone else is going.
1304	Can you get in touch with him?
1305	did he tell you if he was coming or not?
1306	We are still wating on Bankruptcy court to decide our future.
1306	The Dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago.
1306	My division (trading ops) will most likely be sold to either UBS or Citigroup.
1306	Keep in touch.
1306	Eric
1307	Hey Brian, The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.
1307	It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.
1307	As far as our friends go: Bryan Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't; Matt Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; Tim Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; Chad got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to India to teach English to young Indians (how crazy is she?); and Shanna still has a job at Enron in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.
1307	I think that just about covers everything.
1307	I am sure that you have talked to Lenny and know his situation.
1307	How is Hector holding up?
1307	I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.
1307	BTW, Jason (my bro) get married in February.
1307	Keep in touch- Eric
1308	Are you coming?
1308	You are the last one to RSVP.
1308	I need to know so I can make the reservation.
1308	-Eric
1309	I think you gave me a bad e-mail address for tom so can you find out if he is coming or not?
1310	I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.
1310	You are the chosen few.
1310	The cruise is set for Sat.
1310	Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.
1310	Transportation will be arranged for you.
1310	We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.
1310	I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.
1310	The final tally will be $32 a person.
1310	I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.
1310	Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.
1310	Let me know if you have any questions.
1310	-Eric
1311	8 - one person is not on the e-mail
1312	There will be 8 total.
1312	It should be fun.
1312	See ya then
1313	Thanks.
1313	Of the two - I think UBS is better.
1313	It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.
1313	It should be good.
1313	Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
1313	We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.
1313	The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night).
1313	We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
1313	Let me know.
1313	-Eric
1314	can you send the e-mail about the mexican resorts to dominator128@hotmail.com ?
1314	Thanks,
1315	OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.
1315	We will meet at 5 pm SHARP at Cinemark Theaters on Richmond and Sam Houston Parkway (Beltway 8).
1315	This is the movie theater across the street from Jason's apartment.
1315	You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.
1315	Let me know if you have questions.
1315	-Eric
1316	Hi Aunt Bonnie, It is great to hear from you.
1316	We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.
1316	Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.
1316	We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried.
1316	It should be good.
1316	On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.
1316	We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.
1316	I am looking forward to it.
1316	When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?
1316	How is the weather treating you up there?
1316	It was nice to hear from you.
1316	Love, Eric
1317	why can't dad make it?
1318	so bob hebert's finance committee more important?
1319	How about we all go to dinner at Mark's on Sunday night?
1319	How does that sound?
1319	-Eric
1320	You owe $80 for fantasy football.
1320	When can you pay?
1321	i will just come out tomorrow and we will celebrate.
1321	we will get together some other time with shanna
1322	It will just be the two of us on Sunday.
1322	Thought you might like to know.
1323	everyone else paid up front
1324	Is this the old enron building or the new one?
1324	Eric Bass
1325	For some reason your e-mail to Shanna and I was quarantined by enron b/c of virus issues.
1325	What did you send?
1325	It looked like links to Fairfield and Waco weather.
1325	Let me know.
1325	-Eric
1326	Hi Amy, My numbers are home: 713-661-2601 and cell: 713-628-3104.
1326	Call me if you have questions about the offer letter.
1326	-Eric Bass
1327	I am ok with tomorrow.
1327	Sorry I haven't been able to set lunch up.
1327	These crossword puzzles have really kept me busy.
1327	-Eric
1328	what do you think?
1329	hey dad, baxter was the ceo of enron north america at one time.

1330	-Eric
1331	this one has 4.5% financing

1332	val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then.
1332	i didn't have mitch's e-mail so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull.
1332	i guess we could have about 10 people.
1332	what do you think?
1333	he told me that he wasn't sure if he would be in town.
1333	i guess there is no need to have two.
1333	so i won't have one then
1334	Here are the user names that you requested for the ERCOT website: Thanks, Eric
1335	Hey Mitch, Just got your e-mail address.

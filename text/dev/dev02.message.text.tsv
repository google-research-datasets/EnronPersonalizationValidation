0	You too.
0	Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi.
0	Kevin
1	I need your LA address.
1	I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
1	How's everything going?
1	How's Rena?
1	Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA?
1	Also, if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.
1	Thanks, Kevin
2	Dude, What's your work #.
2	I need to give you a call.
2	Kevin
3	I received the email.
3	Thanks,
4	If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well.
4	Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying to do.
4	Kevin
5	Davis, Let me know if this helps.
6	Joke, huh?
7	That is if you ever get you LLC set up.
7	Look forward to trading with you in KR
8	Great to hear from you.
8	I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll enjoy you're experience at Enron.
8	Good luck during your final semester.
8	Kevin
9	Anne Marie, Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the Keep me in mind for next time though.
9	Kevin
10	Great to hear from you.
10	Things have been going well in Houston.
10	Lisa is working for Johnson Controls.
10	It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for about 5 months.
10	I love my new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and Michigan.
10	Things have been incredibly busy.
10	The wedding plans have changed considerably.
10	As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.
10	We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress.
10	How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?
10	Have you been to many Bears games?
10	The Scarlet Knights have been so inconsistent this year.
10	I think a lot is due to their youth.
10	Let's talk soon.
10	Kevin
11	Great to hear from you as always.
11	It'll be great to have you back in the states.
11	By the way, I attached a copy of the boys.
11	I hope it comes across OK.
11	Talk to you soon.
11	Kevin
12	Leroy, Thanks for the email.
12	Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually am just catching up with my emails now - Friday at 5pm.
12	I'm interested in talking to you about the lunch discussion.
12	Kevin
13	You gotta get more current jokes.
13	That one's been floating around for quite some time now.
13	How's everything in SF?
13	Have you moved into your new office?
13	KR
14	Congratulations!!
14	I couldn't be happier for you two.
14	How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, huh?
14	Thanks for the call with the news.
14	We were out for the day, that's why didn't get back to you.
14	I'll try you today.
14	Kevin P.S.
14	Great Name
15	I hope that didn't surprise you.
15	You notice that our avg GMATs are stronger than Harvards.
16	Dave, It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.
16	Hope you enjoyed dinner.
16	Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.
16	I have a quick question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if Mar is currently higher than Feb. You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.
16	Also, what happens if you withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?
16	How is this accounted for?
16	I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.
16	Kevin
17	Congrats Murli, Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.
17	I'm glad you accepted a job at Enron.
17	I know you'll enjoy it.
17	As far as ECI goes, what group is this?
17	Is this the Communications group?
17	I would not recommend EES however.
17	I think you're experience would be better at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.
17	Give me a call at 713-853-6320 (W) and we can talk.
17	Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate brokers to refer you to.
17	Talk to you soon.
17	Kevin
18	Kevin Ruscitti Gas Trading (Central) Hunter Shively Long Term Origination, Power Structuring Gas Trading is my final rotation.
18	This is my permanent position.
18	If you have any questions, call me at X3-8530.
18	Thanks, Kevin Ruscitti
19	We'd love to go to the opener.
19	Let's talk Monday.
19	I don't know if I'll be able to get downstairs by 11:00am, so let's work something out.
19	Kevin
20	Chump, Long time no hear.
20	Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.
20	Between work, the wedding, and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been pretty stressed.
20	As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down considerably.
20	We're only going to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.
20	For me that includes you of course, Moller, Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).
20	Don't tell her though, she's the only one I haven't mentioned anything to.
20	I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room.
20	I feel kinda bad about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like dealing with Kim.
20	She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.
20	We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.
20	We'll have a catered dinner for about 45 folks.
20	It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.
20	Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?
20	I'm psyched you'll be a lot closer.
20	You could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.
20	By that time we should have it in decent shape.
20	We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.
20	It definitely needs a lot of work.
20	We'll be busy for the next year working on it.
20	I think when it's done, it'll look pretty cool.
20	Anyway, send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back.
20	Take care and tell Marie we said hi.
20	Kevin
21	That would be great.
21	Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the Astros are in town that weekend.
21	I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.
21	Glad to hear everything's going well.
21	I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.
21	She heard I got engaged and was pissed I didn't tell her.
21	I think she's smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos.
21	ago.
21	I guess she just chose to ignore me as usual.
21	Talk to you soon.
21	KR P.S.
21	We just closed on a house this past Friday.
21	It's in need of some serious work.
21	Hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it.
22	Kelly, I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 firms and he didn't want to recommend a third at this time.
22	I told him that if anything changes, let me know.
22	It was worth a try anyway.
22	I'll talk to you soon.
22	Kevin
23	We should be in town that week.
23	I'll make sure we save the date.
23	Kevin
24	We will be in town.
24	It would be great to see you and Marie.
24	Sorry for the delayed response, I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.
24	I hope you could make it out.
24	I'll check into some things to do.
24	Let me know.
24	Kevin
25	Thanks for the picture.
25	I'm glad you guys like the gift.
25	Luke looks just like Rena, huh?
25	As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.
25	I think Moller does though.
25	Let me know if you need his #.
25	Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.
25	Kevin
26	Debra, Could you call me when we're set to trade w/ Cinnabar?
26	Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.
26	Kevin
27	Did you pull the trigger?
28	Still waiting to hear back about your possible visit.
28	Any word?
28	Kevin
29	Do you have your schedule yet?
29	Let me know as soon as you can.
29	I need to schedule a trip with work and I'll schedule it around your visit.
29	Looking forward to seeing you.
29	KR
30	I'll be in town all weekend.
30	Looking forward to seeing you.
30	Anything in particular you want to do in the Lone Star State.
30	KR
31	Everything is correct except from my location - 3234B.
31	Let me know if you need anything else.
31	Thanks, Kevin
32	Thanks
33	Unfortunately there're not.
33	I already checked.
34	I have no additional info.
34	I was waiting to hear back from you.
34	I'll give them a call.
34	Kevin
35	Thank you.
35	Kevin
36	I forgot, we have a new telephone # (713) 880-4157.
36	I'll pick you up on Thursday and I'll take Friday off.
36	Looking forward to seeing you.
36	KR
37	You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so poorly.
37	I often look back with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, not to mention his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.
37	He could only be compared to x-Philly and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.
37	The only uncertainty is whether or not Ivan will elect to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.
37	On the house front, we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.
37	It's a fixer-upper.
37	All our weekends are spent working on it.
37	I gotta run, but thanks for the email.
37	Let me know how everything is going in your world.
37	Tell Rina and the kids we said hi.
37	Kevin
38	Thanks for the update.
38	Let me know when everything is a go.
39	Any word.
39	I've been waiting for a while on this issue.
39	Kevin
40	Thanks.
40	Is there something I could do to facilitate the process.
40	KR
41	Good to hear from you.
41	The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his phone number is (708) 418-5075.
41	He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 18049 Torrence Ave Lansing, IL 60438 Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was referred by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.
41	They both bought their engagement rings from Bill.
41	He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of cut, clarity, color, and carat.
41	He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and describe them over the phone.
41	He should encourage you to shop his prices.
41	I found him to be very competitive.
41	Let me know how it goes.
41	Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.
41	Let me know.
41	Kevin
42	Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants.

43	Sounds great.
43	Let me know what your schedule is like.
43	Kevin

44	I should be able to meet for about 15 minutes.
44	Let me know if this works for you.
44	Kevin
45	Thanks for the gift certificate.
45	You shouldn't have done that.
45	I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow for 5 days.
45	I'll talk to you when I get back.
45	Kevin
46	Angela, I'm not looking for another rotation.
46	I will be staying in NG trading and will hopefully be getting promoted this PRC session.
46	Let me know if you have any questions.
46	Kevin
47	Had a great time in SF.
47	Went to the wine country for a few days.
47	Was sad to come back to Houston.
47	We haven't done much on the house since your visit.
47	I'll talk to you soon.
47	Tell Marie we said hi.
47	Kevin

50	Kevin
51	Luke's growing like crazy.
51	Great to see the update.
51	Yeah, the wedding is getting near and the plans are pretty much complete.
51	We're really just having family so the plans at this point are minimum.
51	How's everything in California.
51	Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every Sunday at dinner time?
51	I wouldn't be surprised.
51	Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.
51	What an event.
51	The party included - get this crew - Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., and yes, Vincent Lima.

55	Counterparty: City of Holland, Michigan Contact: Bruce Van Farowe Email: vanfarow@hollandbpw.com Thanks, Kevin
56	Alberto, You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.
56	Chris is starting a new fundamental analysis group.
56	I know he is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.
56	If you're interested in trading, it's probably the best way to get involved in this side of the business.
56	I'm not sure if you have a long term interest in trading or if you're just looking for a rotation.
56	Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide you with some insight into the area.
56	Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to me first if you'd like.
56	Kevin
57	I could meet today after 5pm.
57	Give me a call at x3-6320.
57	Kevin
58	Jay, Give me a call if you have any questions.
58	Looking forward to working withyou.

59	Congratulations to the both of you.

60	Do you still have an interest in the group?
60	Kevin
61	Conway, Where are you at now?
61	Are you in the states?
61	Let me know.
61	Kevin
62	My bro' was supposed to get in touch with you.

62	KR

63	Thanks for your help.
63	Kevin P.S.
63	My desk # is 3234D and my telephone number is 3-6320.
64	Sounds great.
64	Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.
64	I do not have anyone else's email, but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.
64	Just ask him.
64	Let me know if you need anything else.
64	Thanks, Kevin
65	Any deal with a quantity discrepancy is being investigated.
66	I appreciate the email.
66	I figured something must be wrong for you to miss the big day, but I was afraid to call.
66	The important thing, obviously, is that you get better.
66	We'll just have to figure out a way to meet up with you in the near future.
66	Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and recovery.
66	We'll all miss you very much.
66	Hugs and Kisses, Kevin.

68	Kevin
69	I'm glad you had a great time.
69	It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were able to spend the entire weekend with us.
69	I honestly can't remember the last time I had so much fun.
69	I hope you felt the same way.
69	Talk to you soon.
69	Kevin
70	The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat troublesome to maintain.
70	Depending on how old it is, I definitely wouldn't recommend it as your primary car.
70	Hope you had a good time at the wedding.
70	It was one of the best weekends I've had in ages.
70	Talk to you soon.
70	Kevin
71	Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us feel great.
71	We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.
71	We've just been swamped with the house we recently bought.
71	We bought an old small bungalow in the city.
71	What a money pit.
71	Hope everything is going great.
71	Tell everyone we said hi.
71	Thanks again, Kevin
72	Hope all is well.
72	I haven't forgot abt the Hawaiin Electric position.
72	I'll try to get in touch with my friend today.
72	I've been out of town for the last few days.
72	Kevin
73	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.
73	We were out of town the last few days.
73	It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.
73	I think it healthy to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.
73	This better understanding, I find, typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more happiness in life.
73	However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.
73	We all have regrets, but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run.
73	I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.
73	As you might imagine, I got a kick out of that.
73	Talk to you soon.
73	Kevin
74	I'm interested in donating.
74	Can I find out more info about the specifics of the procedure and the timing?
74	Kevin Ruscitti
75	I'm goin' to have to bag on the game.
75	My return flight is at noon on Sunday.
75	I get in at 4:45pm on Friday.
75	What time will you be in?
75	Do you want me to check on a place to eat Friday or Saturday?
75	Let me know.
75	KR
76	What's up?
76	I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.
76	I'm going to meet Conway and Jughead in N.O.
76	on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.
76	I just booked my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could make it down.
76	It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military discount - one of the perks of working for Uncle Sam.
76	I'm sorry for the short notice but we just decided to do it a few days ago.
76	If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.
76	If not, we'll have to get together when I'm in NJ over Christmas.
76	Tell Chris we said hi.
76	Hope everything is going great for the both of you.
76	Talk to you soon.
76	Kevin
77	Tell me about the new job.
77	What will you be doing?
77	Kevin
78	I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.

78	Kevin Ruscitti

84	Let me know if you have any comments.
84	Thanks, Kevin
85	Dan, Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you think.
85	Thanks, Kevin
86	Could you please extend the guest id that expired for FTEnergy, the publisher of gas daily.

86	We need to have these folks view our daily indices.
86	Thanks, Kevin Ruscitti
87	That would be great.
87	Thanks, Kevin

93	Great talking to you today.
93	Glad to hear everything's going great in LA.
93	Kevin
94	If you could only own one stock what would it be?
94	For me it would be EOG Resources - don't ignore this one.
94	KR
95	I hope you picked up some EOG on Friday or today.
95	KR
96	Julie, If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.
96	I do have $5.11 in the system but I could have easily made a mistake.
96	Let me know if you have any other questions.
96	Kevin P.S.
96	Sorry it took me so long to reply.
97	What planet did Gray Davis come from??
97	What's the perception of this guy in California??
97	Hope all is well.
97	KR
98	I've emailed you after both of your messages.
98	Did you fail to get them.
98	Let me know.
98	Kevin
99	What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?
99	What's your opinion on him?
99	He's pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.
99	I was wondering how the citizens of California viewed him.
99	Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.
99	Talk to you soon.
99	Send an updated picture if you have one.
99	Kevin
100	I did get your email and my work number is 713-853-6320.

100	I'll give you a call this weekend.
100	It's incredibly difficult for me to talk at work so I'll give you a shout at home.
100	Talk to you soon.

101	(See attached file: Sweets_Wedding_Letter.doc) (See attached file: Sweets_Wedding_Letter.doc)
102	Mr. B. Lowery, First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.
102	I couldn't even see Kendall.
102	I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try to send it again if you can.
102	In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed - big time.
102	I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.
102	If, like you said, noone really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.
102	It has the potential to affect every person in the state.
102	Not only will consumers end up bailing out the utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will likely prevent many new companies from setting up shop in California.
102	After all, who would want to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power interruptions while paying the highest utility bills in the country.
102	I think that the only way California will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeable future.
102	I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the next couple years.
102	But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.
102	When do you start coming to Texas.
102	Let me know so we can try to hook up.
102	I'll talk to you soon.
102	Kevin
103	Brett, I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.
103	As a result, I didn't call you this weekend.
103	Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.
103	By the way, Happy 35th birthday.
103	I hope you had a good one.
103	Kevin
104	The house thing is a tough call.
104	It's hard to say.
104	If you're not in any hurry to buy, the summer should give you a good indication of continuing energy problems.
104	I personally think that the problem will come and go for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the situation.
104	I have no idea what they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.
104	What's your time frame on a house?
104	If you're only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.
104	It's impossible to time the market - who would've thought San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.
104	There are also a lot of intangibles associated with home ownership as your aware of.
104	I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast of it.
104	Also, you could call me if you have any questions.
104	I'll try to help the best I can.
104	Take care and tell Kim and Kendall I said hi.
104	Kevin
105	Correction, I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things could blow up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.
105	In terms of longer term, I think a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.
105	It will be interesting to see.
105	I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if California gets the kind of heat they had last summer.
105	Stay in touch.

106	Julie, Glad to hear some positive news.
106	Hope you are doing quite well.

107	The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.
107	Enron rating setup irks many workers TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month.
107	Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other.
107	Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" or "issues."
107	An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the window."
107	And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone."
107	The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up with, are not based just on performance.
107	Instead, they compare employee against employee.
107	"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month.
107	While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also expected to be team players, according to the memo.
107	`Horse-trading' of rank denied The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up.
107	Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another employee.
107	An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the manager he is working for, the insider said.
107	Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no horsetrading is going on.
107	The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in stone, she said.
107	Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said.
107	But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect of bargaining.
107	She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees.
107	In years past, only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way.
107	Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well.
107	It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous.
107	Some may not fit in Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's culture, Olson said.
107	It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you have to know what adds value, she said.
107	Some folks just have a hard time in that environment.
107	After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't do well in an entrepreneurial environment.
107	Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago.
107	But they fell out of favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation.
107	Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the lowest.
107	Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3."
107	Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation.
107	People like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said.
107	But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- won't know how they're rated.
107	Managers don't have to reveal the ratings.
107	And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior?
107	You've got to reinvent your job, add new business lines or create something totally new.
107	"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

120	BL, Have you experienced any blackouts yet?
120	I think you'll see a lot this summer.
120	What does everyone think about the situation?
120	Do they think it's a threat or not?
120	I think the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid.
120	Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.
120	When's the next time you'll be in Dallas?
120	Let me know.
120	KR
121	Great to hear from you.
121	Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
121	Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.
121	We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.
121	I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again.
121	One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.
121	We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.
121	We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.
121	Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.
121	There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession.
121	You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand.
121	This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back.
121	However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps, this won't happen.
121	The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.
121	The other factor, of course, is that you could have an increase in supply - new power plants.
121	But being that the amt.
121	of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply doesn't seem likely in the short term.
121	Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with a grain of salt.
121	Talk to you soon.
121	Kevin
122	That state will never be the same.
122	My prediction is that the state will be bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.
122	I hope Lowery has held off on buying his house.
122	Talk to you this weekend.
122	I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.
122	KR
123	Did you go to any parties last night??
123	I was lame, I didn't go to a single one.
123	I heard there were some decent ones.
123	How's life at Duke been?
123	I haven't talked to you much since you've become a big ICE trader.
123	Talk to you soon.
123	KR
124	I don't think many buying opportunities out there.
124	The economy is going to get crushed this year.
124	There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
124	The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs.
124	The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.
124	I feel we've just seen the beginning.
124	I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.
124	Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.
124	The crisis is not a short term problem.
124	As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
124	Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??
124	If you own any CA real estate, sell.
124	The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
124	Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime soon.
124	So, how do impact demand??
124	You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.
124	California will see this reduction in demand over time.
124	If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state.
124	Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
124	If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.
124	Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.
124	Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.
124	Take Care and thanks for the email.
124	Kevin
125	Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.
125	I hope he had a blast.
125	In terms of your email reply, you can have Calpine.
125	How are they going to make money long term if price caps are instituted?
125	This obviously would be the stupidest policy.
125	In addition their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they going to get paid?
125	I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most regulated state in the country.
125	Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??
125	PG&E and Edison International are doomed, as they should be.
125	The state of CA is going to go down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.
125	Unfortunately, noone out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.
125	The politicians are a complete joke.
125	It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.
125	They seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.
125	I honestly think they are incable of solving the problem.

126	You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.

160	I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.
160	Hoping he'll be going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).

163	Beautiful baby - good job Patty.
164	I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154.
164	It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.
164	the astros don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.
164	the manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd with 2 outs.
164	Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of work.
164	Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).
164	The problem is the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand into it.
164	I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really big in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.
164	We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the BMW 330i.
164	It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's a little small - but still sporty.
164	We'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.
164	How's everything on your front.
164	Less classroom time and more flying time???
164	That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.
164	I don't expect him to call of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he was working for 8 mos.
164	in Dallas.
164	Later,
165	What do you think about the 530?
165	Isn't it basically the same thing as the 330 except it's bigger?
165	If so, does it handle as well with the added size and weight?
166	Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.
166	It was embarrassing.
166	I've never seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the Astros).
166	When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?
166	Answer: NEVER.
166	According to Dierker, "... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said.
166	"We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did. How's long's this clown been managing. I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years. It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to Ivan DeJesus. He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up. I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack. Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack? KR
167	Thanks for the advice.
167	Much appreciated.
167	We plan on test driving this weekend.
167	The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership - I heard it's pretty sweet.
167	I have a feeling we're going to lean toward the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
167	I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but we should get a better feel this weekend.
167	I'll keep you informed.
167	Thanks again.
167	KR
168	You'll never believe it but I turned it on at 5:10 so I guess your interview was over.
168	If you have a copy, please send me a copy and I'll pay you for it.
168	How's everything going?
168	Hope all is well.
168	Talk to you soon.
168	Kevin
169	I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci is a 2 door.
169	Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.
169	Not that disappointed though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the ML.
169	They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than with winning the game.
169	Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs at all.
169	If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.
169	It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.
169	I'm sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.
169	Anyway, what's up on your front.
169	Are you still going out to Cali to visit Hop and Denise?
169	How's flying?
169	KR
170	It didn't down here b/c I watched it from 5:15 - 6pm unless it actually came on 4pm down here with the time difference.
170	I bet that's what happened.
170	KR
171	I'd like to but i'm tied up doing house stuff all day.
171	Have you found a group in Houston?
171	How's the search going?
171	Tell Matt I said hi.
172	We have a lot of things to do Saturday or else I would - believe me.
172	We'll have to get together the next time.
172	Let me know if I can help any more with your search.
172	Kevin
173	Sounds good based on 1 condition.
173	You and ML do not pick up everyone's dinner.
173	We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.
173	Sounds like fun.
173	Good idea - must've been ML's.
173	KR
174	Great to hear from you.
174	Glad to know everyone's doing well.
174	Did you know Moller was going to be on TV or were you just channel surfing?
174	How did he do?
174	Work's going OK.
174	ENE stock has been getting destroyed.
174	A lot of negative press abt management.
174	I would sell your shares if you still have them.
174	It's $30 right know but I have a feeling it's going lower.
174	Tell Dave also if you talk to him.
174	News has been coming out that I wasn't aware of.
174	Anyway, Lisa's job is going great - she's really happy.
174	We haven't been up to a lot lately - just hanging around the neighborhood.
174	The anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary.
174	What a bunch of nuts we have living in this world.
174	I have a feeling it could get worse before it gets better.
174	Don't open any letters from unknown companies or counterparties.
174	Take care of yourself and Gloria and Tommy.
174	Tell them we said hi and we'll talk to you soon.
174	Kevin
175	I'd sell all of the ENE.
175	KR
176	Steve, Hope everything is going well.
176	Unfortunately I won't be able to attend the reunion.
176	Hope you have a great time.
176	Talk to you soon.
176	Kevin
177	Steve, Not a lot.
177	Just working and watching my company's stock get the shit kicked out of it.
177	I did get married last year, but everything else has been pretty quiet.
177	How 'bout yourself.
177	What have you been up to?
177	Who have you kept in touch with?
177	Kevin
178	I'm not going to be able to make it.
178	I talked to Lisa and we're heading back to NJ for her friends wedding.
178	I'm hoping to make a trip to CA sometime next year.
178	I hope you have a great time and tell Lulenski I said hi.
178	Kevin
179	I think Enron is going to $10.
179	I've been quite concerned for the last month+.
179	It looks like a number of the senior execs have done some questionable acts.
179	It's been quite the moral buster.
179	They need to clean shop and get rid of the CEO and entire board for letting these types of actions occur.
179	We will never regain investor confidence until this occurs.
179	The problem with ENE is that we make an incredible amt of money on the wholesale side of the energy business (natural gas and power) but we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of money (Azurix water co., broadband, residential marketing. They need to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on the core businesses. In my opinion, some of these execs, former and current, should go to jail. It's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great company. I'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book written about this. I'm sure it will be a best seller. Anyway, let me get off my soapbox. I'm glad to hear you got a new job. That would be great if Chris gets the package and looks for something more enjoyable. Congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your folks I was asking about them. Lisa and I haven't finalized any plans to NJ in Jan but I'll let you know as soon as we do. We're both looking forward to hooking up with you guys. Conway won't have to go overseas. He said he's the last one they'll activate. His cell phone # is 240-298-7007. I have to look for his email but i'll let you know when I find it. Take care and good to hear from you. Kevin
180	Are you taking any resumes?
180	I need to start the process.
180	I don't know what the future holds here?
180	I don't think anyone does.
180	We don't know if there will be more mgmt surprises?
181	Sure, no problem.
182	How's everything?
182	Haven't heard from you in some time.
182	What's up?
182	You're not in Afghanistan are you?
182	Only kidding?
182	KR
183	You could call me at home if you like at 713-880-4157.
183	Kevin Ruscitti
184	No, There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely, I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.
184	As a result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial situation is better known.
184	Glad to hear everything's going well.
184	Did you go out to California?
184	What are your plans over Thanksgiving?

185	Kevin
186	Robin, How's everything in NY?
186	The flow of info around here has been horrible.
186	I have no idea on what's happening - a bad situation to be in obviously.
186	We're just reading all the news on the wires.
186	Just starting to look at some options in case the trading desk vanishes.
186	Do you know if Sempra in CT is still looking for people.
186	I figure it's time to see what else may be out there.
186	I'm sure we'll talk a little later.
186	Kevin
187	Dave, Take a look at this before you pass it on.

190	Thanks, Kevin
191	Let me tell you who won't win - RU.

191	I saw them for the 1st time this weekend on TV.
191	They are horrible.
191	Hope everything's going well.
191	Life at Enron sucks.
191	I'm sure you've been following the situation.

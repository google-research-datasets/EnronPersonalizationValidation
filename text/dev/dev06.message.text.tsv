0	Hi Teresa, Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out where I am located!
0	I also found out that I need to correct the company for my directory information.
0	It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage instead of Enron Corporation.
0	Thanks and talk to you soon!
1	Met with Lee Hart.
1	Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday.
1	Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.
1	Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural take or pay case.
1	Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).

39	Great Expectations BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc. ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT pumped into Cynet.
39	The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging.
39	That may not sound like much.
39	But imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines.
39	Cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.
39	The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to go public out of Houston.
39	How's it doing?
39	Not so hot.
39	After the initial offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and now hovers around $1.
39	It has yet to recover.
39	Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million.
39	Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran Electronic's wireless modems.
39	That's got to be worth something.
39	Compaq Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet connections to its iPAQ Pocket.
40	Azurix Water.
41	Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25.
41	They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher energy prices!
41	Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.
42	Documentation for the Southern to BP Energy contract assignments.
43	FYI..assignment request from Southern Company.
44	FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.
44	On contract #22538, there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.
44	For October, I told him the spreads are still above Max Rate and he is in agreement.
44	November...hmmm...above Max Rate?!?!
45	FYI...assignment or capacity release?
46	FYI...please continue processing Assignments.
47	No vacation or sick time off.
47	Thanks.
48	done.
49	FYI
50	Transwestern average deliveries to California were 1,083 MMcf/d (99%) while east deliveries averaged 276 MMcf/d.
50	San Juan lateral throughput averaged 847 MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco averaged 46 MMcf/d.
50	Mojave deliveries averaged 40 MMcf/d throughout the week.
50	El Paso average deliveries to California were 2,254 MMcf/d (77%) : Cash spreads between PG&E Topock and SoCal Needles narrowed from .42 on Monday to only .11 on Friday.
50	Friday Enron Online basis numbers:
51	Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!
51	The reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent transporting deals on Transwestern.
51	For example, we executed a one year deal for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million gross margin.
51	Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.
51	Two other examples for 11 months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.
51	Hopefully this will justify our need for this system.
51	Let me know if you need anything else.
52	FYI...
53	I will be taking Vacation this afternoon.
53	Thanks.

57	EOG interconnect is finishing this week and will be in service by this weekend.
57	It will initially flow 8-10000/day and will increase to over 15000.
58	In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc. Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.

119	Happy Holidays!
119	Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.
119	In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.
119	Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.
119	I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.
119	What can I do?
119	Desperate Dear Desperate, First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.
119	Install Tears 6.2 and enter the command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.
119	Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0.
119	But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1.
119	Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.
119	DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program.
119	These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.
119	In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.
119	You might consider buying additional software to improve performance.
119	I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.
119	Good luck.
120	Transwestern's average deliveries to California were 959 MMBtu/d (88%), with San Juan lateral throughput at 827 MMBtu/d.
120	Total East deliveries averaged 398 MMBtu/d.
120	El Paso's average deliveries to California were 2122 MMBtu/d (72%): Thursday's posted Gas Daily prices: TW San Juan n/a Enron basis: n/a
121	FYI.
121	Section 13(h) does state 3 months prior to expiration and 07/31/02 is 3 months before 10/31/02.
122	This is the San Juan to San Juan contract, with alternates out of the path.
122	Same as December.
123	Approved.
123	Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days.
124	Approved.
124	Please increase, on Amendment #4, the West Texas receipts from 14,265 to 18,000 effective Nov 2002-Feb 2003.
124	This will still leave a balance of 2,000 at the "East of Thoreau" area.
124	The Red Rock administration contract will also need to be adjusted.
124	Thanks.
125	Hope you are feeling better!

161	This looks good from the Commercial side.
161	I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.
161	Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.
161	When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.

190	Weather Trading Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two.
190	The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter.
190	If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter.
190	Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases.
190	Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations.
190	It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant .
190	In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997.
190	Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product.
190	He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor.
190	With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe provided three days of the latest developments in European trading.
190	The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills.
190	As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

201	Subject: NWP System Notice - System Operations Post Date: March 15, 2002 Category: CRITICAL NOTES Subcategory: MISCELLANEOUS Subject: System Operations Notice Text: All Shippers Letter #02-033 Date: 3/15/02 Time: 11:00 a.m. MST Subject: System Operations The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.
201	Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests on April 16 and 17, 2002.
201	During this time Northwest will have no access to Clay Basin.
201	Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5, 2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.
201	During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.
201	With Clay Basin shut in, Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.
201	Northwest will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.
201	If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations; entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate; and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.
201	If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.
201	Northwest's customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson Prairie storage during this work.
201	Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the situation closely.
201	Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.
201	Northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.
201	If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services representative.
202	More information.
202	The Questar (Southern Trails) tie-in is for one day only, 04/02.
202	The Ignacio to Blanco line, from La Plata, will be down over 700 million (which is pretty much the whole lateral) from 04/02-04/05.
202	Talk soon, Michelle.
203	Burlington has agreed to execute this outstanding OBA if the name on the contract is changed.
203	Can we update the name from BURLINGTON RESOURCES TRADING, INC. to BURLINGTON RESOURCES Gathering, INC.

0	The utilities in California have been heavily engaged in maintaining "fortress monopoly" at home while advocating "openness" abroad.
0	Any info showing the discrepancy is useful.
0	No big deal.
0	Just curious.

1	Mona suggested that it would be a good idea to try to schedule a separate meeting to discuss rather than attempt to do it during our weekly staff meeting.
1	Let me know if this date works.
2	OK, i'm trying this again.
2	Jim, please let me know if you receive this.
2	I'm attaching the previous notes.
3	Hi.
3	FYI.
3	Yesterday a deal was submitted to the California Commission (without just about everyone in the industry signing) to restructure Socalgas.
3	More details to come, but wanted to give a flavor, knowing that you're actively engaged in negotiations.
3	Assuming a 10.01.00 approval date by the Commission: 90 days after approval Windowing process replaced with OFO system Interstate capacity unbundled for core customers effective April 2001: Ability to balance using 3rd party provider Open season for Socal storage Secondary market for storage (using Alltrade if want to) Trade OFO imbalances and imbalance rights (using Alltrade if want to ) Open season for Socal intrastate capacity Secondary market for intrastate capacity (using Alltrade if want to) Pooling at new city gates
4	I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I can't recall, I'm sending to all.
4	First, I apologize.
4	I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc. So I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the "clarifications" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).
4	The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.
4	And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).
4	My biggest concern is question 6.
4	My answer (despite some outliers) sez that there ain't no loan in June.
4	(This may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability.) Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.
4	(If you run the sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.) Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with something remotely similar.
4	Best, Jeff
5	Greetings: Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, etc. I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes of credit check.
5	Here is some additional information about the project.
5	If any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can forward along to GP for answers.
5	At this point we have tentatively scheduled a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F.
5	office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM (PDT).
5	A Little Background: Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, S.F.).
5	Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea at each city point).
5	Total undersea length is ~900 km.
5	At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
5	At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
5	Will deploy DWDM.
5	Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific systems.
5	In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes a terrestial leg from S.F.
5	to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF and Monterey.
5	Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial leg).
5	Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego to create a complete loop.
5	Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from Coastal Commission.
5	Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) built and lit by end of Q1 2001.
5	Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.
5	May end up bypassing Monterey altogether.
5	The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless" when it comes to marketing the capacity.
5	Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in (per Ethan's emails).
5	They are distressed.
5	Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
5	Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.
5	Best, Jeff
6	FYI.
6	I didn't receive email yesterday, and I only started receiving them today at 11 AM.
6	Quesiton: After Clinton's speech, don't you think the convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?
6	I'm worried----he's so pathetic.
7	Great.
7	Glad to hear it.
7	Did you get my voice mail?
7	Makes sense for you to go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.
7	I've talked to folks internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm in Houston).
7	I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of the project will be.
7	Best, Jeff
8	When's a good time to discuss?
8	I'd like to get as diverse a group of co-sponsors as possible, and as many as possible.
9	Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought ought to be made publicly available.
9	We're discussing how we can ensure that the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its "investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.
9	Is there anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch (or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its investigation and that we ought to target for public release?
9	Thanks alot.
9	Best, Jeff
10	Hi.
10	I'm hear in Houston---currently at Elizabeth's desk.
10	Do we have a number for Sue Nord and Scott to call into?
10	Or are we just going to call them from the conference room?
10	I'll come look for you later.
10	Jeff
11	Everyone, meet everyone else's email address.
11	Thanks to one and all for the taking the time to discuss the issues.
11	Seems that the conensus is that the meeting was useful.
11	Have a great weekend.
11	Best, Jeff
12	Thanks again.
13	FYI.
14	I can be on the call.
14	Please let me know if you get this, since I've been having severe email problems.
14	Thanks.
14	Best, Jeff
15	monday--in office tuesday--in office wednesday--in office
16	Thanks very much to all for your assistance.
16	Is it possible to get some idea of exactly what the amount to be refunded is?
16	Thanks so much again for your help.
16	Best, Jeff
17	Likewise.
17	Hope I'm not being to much of a pain on the calls.
17	Just that Enron---I'm quite certain---won't lend it's name to anything that's less than stellar.
17	And I'm sure GSPP would like for the conference to be all that it can be, too.
17	How'd things go in Portland?
17	Best, Jeff
18	FYI.
19	FYI.
20	plx check fax (646.8160).
20	Leg is out.
20	give a call.
20	Jeff
21	Glad to hear it went well.
21	Debra never called.
22	been on vacation.
22	i'm back.
22	would you like me to call?
23	Glad to be of help.
23	Glad to hear it went well.
23	Someone sent me some press on the hearing that looked great.
24	very much appreciated.
24	i'm up and running, and all seems to be going well.
25	If you would like me to attend and think that it would be useful, just let me know.
25	And thanks very much for the tip on the WSJ story.

26	Hi.
26	Thanks for all the help.
26	Life's nuts.
26	I'll try to give you a call later in the day and catch up.
27	Greetings.
27	Just wanted to let you know that I've dropped Product Management, E262A-1.
27	So I can be removed from the list.
27	Thank you.
28	Just checking in to see if anything that you folks were working on ever got into the S.D.
28	Tribune, etc., or if you were continuing to work on things?
28	Hope all's well.
28	It's a jungle out there.
28	Best, Jeff
29	Greetings.
29	I'm back from vacation.
29	Trading voicemail with Jessie Knight (trying to get him to appear at the hearing).
29	If there's anything else you need me to do---call Ms Van Way, etc.---just let me know.
29	Best, Jeff
30	Greetings.
30	Is there a chance of setting up a call-in number for these meetings?
30	Hope all is well in the land of craziness.
30	Best, Jeff
31	Rob had Robert Michaels give me a ring re: potential panelist at the field hearing.
31	Be happy to pitch him to Ms Van Way.
31	Thoughts?
32	My apologies.
32	I took a vacation that I was in much need of, and as you know, it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the day-to-day mess.
32	And I came back to utter chaos.
32	Regarding my homework assignment, I checked my records and, lo and behold, I am completely vested.
32	That said, I also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to make leaving a compelling proposition.
32	Of course, it goes without saying that working with you is about as compelling as it gets, but when I stack up the other pieces of the puzzle, they seem somewhat less compelling than the opportunity to work with you.
32	It is so enticing.
32	But it is with extreme regret that I am inclined to decline your gracious offer.
32	Would be happy to discuss it further, and you know without me saying that I am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative.
32	Give a holler when you find a minute.
32	Best, Jeff
33	FYI.
34	Though I had a somewhat different notion when I initially raised the idea of co-sponsorship, I agree with Lee's observations and think that we should proceed the way he suggests.
35	House power subcommittee.
36	Will you send a note to folks regarding the GA meeting here in SF next Thursday?
37	Greetings.
37	Let me know when you would like to discuss the "value" that GA brought to our pipeline group.
37	(We discussed it when I was in Houston week before last.) Best, Jeff
38	FYI.
38	According to Roger, if the freeze is extended out toward 2004 for PG&E and Edison, his book makes BIG money.
39	does tomorrow work?
40	thursday or friday works best for me.
41	thursday or friday works best for me, but i might be able to make wednesday, too.
42	sorry about that.
42	meant to send to tracy (no "e") cooper in Portland, Oregon.
43	Darlin', the last thing I want is to be rid of you.
43	Get in touch when you can.
43	And next time you're in town, I'm buying.
43	Best, Jeff
44	Thursday, 9.7, works for me for meeting #1.
45	We talked about this in detail with Steve when he was in Houston.
45	Please check with him.
45	The idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to do just about anything.
45	Also, there are problems with the decision that Steve was going to talk with Pulsifer about.
45	Need to get status of those conversations.My understanding was that, if there's a problem with the decision, perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the Tuesday.
45	We'll need to find that out, too.
46	position on what?
47	Jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy, etc. over the next many months.
47	Might be a good opportunity to clarify how we coordinate on these matters.
48	C1 was up 10 points today.
48	I figure that means you signed a deal with them yesterday....
49	retest
50	Sounds good.
50	Given that Sue is going to be back on Tuesday, you may want to coordinate drafting duties with her.
51	Howdy: Just between thee and me, I think this note gets to some of the challenges we faced and discussed as part of our "group gropes" over the last several months.
51	With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.
51	May even result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little "process" on the front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.
51	Anywho, just my two cents.
51	Hope your meetings in Salem went well.
51	Best, Jeff
52	FYI.
53	Greetings: Wow, lots of fun out there, eh?
53	Don't know what it will be like without Steve Peace around any more....
53	I have a very mundane question, though.
53	What prices for intrastate capacity did the PUC finally come up with in the Sempra BCAP for large generators under the new "Sempra-wide" rate doctrine?
53	Thanks a million.
53	Best, Jeff
54	'Thanks a million.
54	Agree that humor is needed right now, though it's in short supply, so to speak....
55	did i, or did i not, already give you mine.
55	signed, confused.
56	Don: See attached from today's WSJ.
57	Greetings David: Just checking in to gauge how you folks are doing in cobbling together a proposal and to see if any roadblocks have been encountered.
57	Hope all is well.
57	Best, Jeff
58	Greetings All: If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.
58	Steve Bowen & Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of weeks ago in Houston.
58	Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review.
58	Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.
58	Thoughts?
58	P.S.
58	Some good news.
58	Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona (in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.
58	Well, I've spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.
58	Best, Jeff
59	We'll send a card.
59	She's 19?
59	Well, if we have to, we'll take some tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too.
59	Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road while my is doing my road at the end of the month?
59	He's going to fax me the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.
59	To be honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.
59	He's pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to Rolls Royce-style road.
59	And if you want to take a pass, that's of course great, too.
59	I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know.
60	Need Amber's address, too.
61	Thank you.
62	Yes, please forward along.
62	Kathleen and Thom, Don Schultz is, and has been for about two decades, a rather earnest and tenacious crusader for DSM.
62	Very detail-oriented sort of fellow.
62	Works for the California Commission's "Division of Ratepayer Advocates."
62	Just a heads up.
62	Best, Jeff
63	Greetings Dr. Gobbo: If my memory serves, you should have arrived back in Italy, or will return soon.
63	Since we met, I have spoken with Severin Borenstein, who is intimately involved with California's electricity restructuring (melodrama?) and a renowned energy economist at UC Berkeley.
63	Severin has offered to serve as a contact for you as you continue to take on the formidable task of restructuring your country's electric industry.
63	I've included his contact information below.
63	And, of course, if there is ever anything I can do for you, do not hesitate to contact me.
63	All the best, Jeff E.T.

63	Energy Institute University of California 2539 Channing Way Berkeley, CA 94720-1900 Berkeley, CA 94720-5180 Email: borenste@haas.berkeley.edu WWW:
64	That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll tell Jeff (my road guy).
65	Nope, not at this point.
65	Rather than start with money, we'd rather start with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.
65	Sound reasonable?
66	FYI.
67	call me unreasonable.
67	i can take it.
67	been called worse, though, of course, coming from you, it hurts more.
68	I don't we're ready.
68	could call at some point so we can discuss?
69	Alpert has passed both Assembly and Senate--on way to Governor.

69	Jeff
70	Do you mind if I meet with Carl and Severin and Rich next time I'm over at Haas to discuss this a bit with them?
71	I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind.
71	did you send Amber's address?
71	if so, i've deleted it.
71	could you send again?
71	also, are you sure you don't want the tickets?
71	they come with free parking (it ain't the closest lot, but hey, it saves 20$).
71	also, please let me know when you've confirmed with the G.O. that you don't want to do road, so that I can tell Jeff.
71	And of course we'll pick up the football forms, just make sure they're somewhere easy to find (butcher block table?).
71	we'll be coming up tomorrow evening to pick up all the stuff.
71	how's the canopy?
71	you and eldon playing ping pong?
72	god bless you.
73	California's Price Caps Raising Average Cost of Power The retail price caps imposed in California are leading to higher averageprices for longer periods of time as demand responsiveness is dulled and supply is retarded, according to a report released by Morgan Stanley DeanWitter.
73	Traders interviewed by the firm said that calendar strips for 2001through 2003 have traded in excess of $100/MWh, or around $30/MWh higher than a month ago.
73	What's more, the firm said, the expected trough in the forwardcurve * projected in the 2002-2003 time frame * "continues to move out in time."
73	The Dean Witter study reported that the change in futures pricing for theCalifornia Oregon Border (a proxy for Northern California pricing) and atPalo Verde (a proxy for Southern California pricing) trading hubs show similar upward trends from June through August.
73	The study said the most alarming thing for the state is the increased threaof power outages.
73	Higher priced regions like the desert Southwest and theNorthwest "will suck exports out of the state and deter imports," Dean Witter said.
73	The tight supply situation is pushing average prices higher, more often, and increasing the risk imports won't arrive at all when they are truly needed.
74	I assume, since C1's stock rose 10 points yesterday, that you struck a deal with them!
75	So far, all is well.
75	Thanks for asking.
75	Best, Jeff
76	Hopefully you mean "buy?"
77	You have access to generation daily?
77	Just wondering if the guy wrote the story...
78	Sell.
79	Man, Illinois is tough.
79	One has to submit testimony to get certified!
79	How are things going?
79	Got your voice mail.
79	Hope all's well.
79	Recovered yet from the conventions?
80	what do you mean high?
81	Cathy Van Way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite to the hearing.
81	(I continue to cajole Jessie Knight to appear.) During the call, she mentioned that the committee intends to invite Steve Kean and that she needed someone to email here Steve's vitals so that they could write a letter inviting him.
82	Got your message.
82	You're a pal.
82	Can't thank you enough.
82	Wish you the best of luck on the options program.
82	If you can send me a copy of the presentation on the options programs, boy, I'd love to have one.
82	Please give our lovely counsel a big hug for me.
82	And I plan to be out there again real soon.
82	Best, Jeff
83	Despite Its Depressed Stock, Commerce One Prepares for Blastoff By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 8/31/00 1:15 PM ET URL: Poor Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq).
83	Despite its best efforts, including Wednesday's 21% gain, it's still less than half the stock it used to be.
83	Trading at about $63 a share, it's well off its split-adjusted high of $165.50, reached near the end of last year.
83	Meanwhile, archrival Ariba (ARBA :Nasdaq), at about $150 a share, has steadily been marching back toward its all-time high of $183.31.
83	It has jumped 47% since reporting its earnings on July 12.
83	But as Wednesday's move may indicate, it may be Commerce One's turn.
83	People are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with Germany's SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR).
83	An exchange that Commerce One is helping build for the big automakers is about to crank up.
83	And perhaps more importantly, some observers are beginning to see some value in Commerce One's focus on so-called direct B2B, which involves buying and selling major supplies like steel for cars instead of office supplies.
83	Issues Aplenty Of course, there are still plenty of issues facing Commerce One, the same issues that have held its stock down.
83	For instance, it carries the stigma of being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry exchanges actually will work.
83	Its sluggish stock also puts it at a disadvantage to chief competitor Ariba when it comes to making acquisitions to grow.
83	But for now, there are signs that sentiment is shifting in Commerce One's favor.
83	Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, sees three short-term positives for Commerce One.
83	(He's the analyst who had the gall to downgrade Ariba on valuation concerns. His firm hasn't done underwriting for either company.) Mlinar says the word on Wall Street is that Commerce One, along with its new best friend SAP, will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks.
83	(TSC's Adam Lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between Commerce One and SAP.) While those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee a moon shot for a company's stock, they could show that the partnership is working.
83	Two weeks ago, they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy industries.
83	Commerce One declined to comment about the possible exchanges.
83	Blastoff On top of that, Covisint, the mega-exchange that Commerce One is helping build for the auto industry, is slated to begin operations at the end of September, which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges actually work.
83	Then there's the coming completion of Commerce One's acquisition of consulting firm AppNet (APNT:Nasdaq).
83	Investors initially reacted negatively to that deal.
83	But since then, it's become clear that there aren't enough consultants in B2B to go around, so the deal will give Commerce One its own army of geeks to plug in its software.
83	"There's no doubt that investors are in a good position with" either Commerce One or Ariba, Mlinar says.
83	"But it's a matter now of who has the near-term operational catalysts. I think there, it's Commerce One."
83	Beyond those short-term catalysts, others say Commerce One has been positioning itself smartly for the long term, especially with its focus on the direct business.
83	"We think the big play here is in direct," says John Biestman, director of investor relations for Commerce One.
83	"While we will continue to service the indirect procurement side, we are hitting at the heart of where we think B2B will be, which is direct goods. We want to be the best-of-breed player there."
83	Ariba has also made headway there, but its focus has primarily been on the indirect business, in part because it's easier to get companies to buy things like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the manufacturing process.
83	But with companies becoming more comfortable about buying and selling online, they're now looking to the direct business as a way to save more money.
83	With big customers like GM (GM:NYSE) and Boeing (BA :NYSE) and its partnership with SAP, Commerce One could be ready to exploit this growing comfort.
83	Direct vs. Indirect "What's happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the difference between direct and indirect," says Ben Smith, a consultant for A.T.
83	Kearney.
83	(His firm hasn't done consulting for Commerce One.) "Picking a [software] solution for one doesn't necessarily include the other."
83	Smith points back to Commerce One's partnership with SAP.
83	For years, the German software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software that helps businesses build things.
83	If a firm can successfully plug that in to software designed to buy the building blocks -- like Commerce One's software -- it could have a winning combination.
83	"The SAP partnership legitimizes Commerce One in the direct materials space," Smith says.
83	"It gives them much more depth from the product standpoint than they can possibly build on their own."
83	Of course, Ariba isn't letting this business just slide by.
83	It's working with partners i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and IBM(IBM:Nasdaq).
83	But this is Commerce One's focus.
83	So if companies do begin to use direct B2B, Commerce One will be ready and waiting.
84	Thank you.
85	Thank you.
85	Exciting stuff.
86	Rumor on the street that the legislature may make a last minute play to change the make-up of the governing boards (at least for the ISO) from the current stakeholder make-up to one made up of appointees of the governor.
87	will do.
88	the damned book costs $100!
88	i've borrowed yours.
88	you know where to find it.
89	FYI.
90	Internet B2Bs Rose Hard and Fell Hard Once Before.
90	Time for Act Two?
90	By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 8/30/00 9:22 PM ET URL: Beware the booming B2Bs.
90	Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day.
90	While some market watchers said investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro Big Day for B2B Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.
90	"You've got me," says Bill Epifanio, B2B analyst at J.P. Morgan.
90	"They're all going nuts on nothing."
90	Since earnings season ended, sentiment about B2B stocks has shifted back to the rose-colored variety in this sector.
90	While this change is based on the concrete results that companies like Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and FreeMarkets (FMKT:Nasdaq) delivered, investors also may want to pause and reflect.
90	After all, it was only this past spring that investors grabbed any B2B stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth, only to have them come crashing back down.
90	Focus "Before, we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be, and that's when it got out of hand," says Eric Upin, B2B analyst at Robertson Stephens.
90	"Now, you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and revenue."
90	Upin looks to Ariba and i2 Technologies as examples of companies that are actually delivering.
90	(He rates both a buy, and his firm hasn't done underwriting for either.) Ariba recorded $153 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter.
90	Deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers a product or does its job.
90	It's a good signal, because if people are willing to pay before a company gives them something in return, it means there's strong demand.
90	Ariba was up $8, or 6%, to $152.50.
90	i2 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software, and it has a partnership with Ariba and IBM (IBM:NYSE).
90	It climbed $11.13, or 7%, to Reaching?
90	But in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for any B2B stock, Ventro finished up $2.69, or 21%, at $15.50 on no news.
90	This is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor second-quarter performance, with just $1.8 million in net revenue.
90	"Investors need to be more careful regarding which of the B2Bs they select," adds David Hilal, a B2B analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey.
90	"When B2B was at its highest, any company that used that acronym seemed to perform well. Now, you have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new economy."
90	Meanwhile, one of the most interesting subplots Wednesday involved Commerce One.
90	On no real news -- there was talk about an already announced deal -- Commerce One shot up $10.88, or 21%, to $63.25.
90	There's been a lot of chatter about the company lately.
90	Gossips love to talk about how its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR) might lead to a merger.
90	Then there's the persistent rumor that the two companies will soon announce two more Internet exchanges for major industry groups.
90	On top of that, Covisint, the big auto exchange that Commerce One is helping build, is setting up to launch near the end of September.
90	Lump that in with the fact that Commerce One's stock has slouched in Ariba's shadow lately, add a dash of Wednesday's positive sector sentiment, and you've got the most active stock on the Nasdaq Wednesday.
90	It traded more than 27 million shares, whereas it usually trades 6.6 million.
90	Ready to Bolt Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, says the stock has been setting up for a move for a while.
90	"September is a big month for them; they have so much on the table for a potential lift," Mlinar says.
90	He's been crowing about Commerce One since mid-August, when he said the company was starting to look more attractive than Ariba on a valuation basis.
90	And overall, Mlinar contends that conditions were right for a B2B run.
90	"The emphasis and momentum has clearly been building lately," he says.
90	"There wasn't much, on a broad basis, since April, and now we're seeing a total rotation into these names."
90	Which is just what some observers are cautioning against.
91	Hey buddie: Give me a call tomorrow.
91	Want to catch up on a few things.
91	Thanks a bunch.
91	Best, Jeff
92	I'd prefer to wait on the call.
92	I'll be distributing my suggested refinements to and speakers for Rob's "Option 3" by COB today.
93	I'll be in D.C. Can't wait to see you.
93	Best, Jeff
94	Can get that number.
94	You want it pre "Blue Book" or pre AB 1890, or both.
95	If there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging points we've developed internally): It's the gas industry, stupid---for profit transcos is the answer.
95	California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with another--the PX.
95	PX's are not necessarily bad things.
95	But PXs with a monopoly is a very bad thing.
95	Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible.
95	"Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage" story.
95	Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed NOT to encourage retail choice and competition.
95	Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to providers offering an "insurance policy" (i.e., fixed price deals) against the volatile and risky power exchange price.
95	When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got.
95	Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been inflicted.
95	The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).
95	This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints.
95	Best, Jeff
96	Here are some more prices.
96	Many thanks to Roger Yang.
97	Power plant siting bill to follow if you'd like it.
98	Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn By Craig D. Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive -- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills.
98	The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers ultimately face the daunting task of paying them.
98	No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers.
98	And while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- beginning in 2003.
98	"The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there," said Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity customers.
98	The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May.
98	Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E customers.
98	The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs for each customer in so-called balancing accounts.
98	A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due in 2003 or 2004.
98	A third bill before the governor would speed the construction of power plants.
98	So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it obligates them to pay the balance with interest later.
98	The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts come due.
98	Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003.
98	IOUs of that magnitude, said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills.
98	Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about $55; they now stand at about $130.
98	Consumer advocates say it's likely power prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under the Davis proposal.
98	"The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting profits," said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based consumer group.
98	Hoge said the bills that emerged "seemed the best a corrupt system could spit out."
98	She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric generating companies and wholesale power markets.
98	FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies are reasonable.
98	TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants.
98	Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis bill, although he said it won't fix "the almost irreparably broken California energy system."
98	"The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market," Shames said.
98	"It's a market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies."
98	But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills.
98	But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes the rate-cap legislation.
98	"This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs," said Court, who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared to last year.
98	Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from customers over the next three years.
98	The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them.
98	"The problem is with the wholesale markets," said Baum, who today becomes chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra.
98	"This legislation does nothing but postpone a big bill."
98	He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission.
98	"If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed and can't stand," Baum said.
99	Talked to Dave.
99	In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it.
99	It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key points: Based on an expectation that the "expedited siting" bill would help site plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.
99	The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm requirement.
99	The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
99	In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of going to the market, thus killing the economics.
99	On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that "...it be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and maintain the plant," it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks prefer).
99	In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.
99	Point 2 in bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.
99	If any questions, let me know.
99	Bruno has emailed the price cap and the "general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap" bills, and faxed the siting bill.
99	Best, Jeff
100	Hi.
100	My brother just called.
100	would you mind if I gave him the Sunday Cubs tickets.
100	If you've already secured people for them, not big deal, but I think his kids would get a big kick out of it.
100	They're both big ball players.
101	you're a saint.
101	who won at ping pong last nite?
102	well?
103	Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU?
103	Jessie Knight called me.
103	He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D.
103	They plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D.
103	that the best thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider.
103	("Do you want the Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them yourself?") They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well they're doing.
103	Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron customer and is going to contact the Chamber.
103	Be useful to have a business or two, or, UC/CSU.
103	Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try.
104	Available Wednesday but not Tuesday.
104	Happy holiday to all.
105	Man, there must be a lot of bad hair out your way with that kind of heat.
106	Hi Gavin: Could you do me a favor (know you're busy).
106	Someone told me that there's an article in last Thursday's?
106	NYT blaming the California fiasco on former California Commissioner Dan Fessler, who was responsible (a few years back) for putting in place the structure we have here.
106	Have you seen it?
106	If so could you forward?
106	If not, could you try and find it and forward.
106	Very much appreciated.
106	Best, Jeff
107	Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects.
107	Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over the goal line: On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state.
107	Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in California.
107	That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants.
107	Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers.
107	Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes.
107	If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will continue, or worsen.
107	California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.
107	On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning.
107	It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect.
107	Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road.
107	So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely.
107	There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider.
107	Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like Enron.
107	But for the press reports, they hardly know there's a crisis.
108	Some thoughts on the conference.
108	Best, Jeff
109	Making it hot for deregulation Gregory Palast The New York Times The News & Observer Raleigh, NC Final (Copyright 2000) PECONIC, N.Y. -- While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, something important was being debated 100 miles to the south in San Diego, where there was a real display of populism.
109	There politicians have enrolled 2 million citizens in a scary economic experiment.
109	This year, San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices.
109	When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that homeowners' bills would fall "by at least 20 percent."
109	In fact, bills jumped 124 percent this August over last.
109	Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24 other states have rushed to imitate California's lead.
109	Actually, Californians were lucky.
109	Every hour of every day, San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool.
109	On the first hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to $9,999 per megawatt hour.
109	That's about 5,000 percent more than the once- controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse.
109	According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids.
109	In fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day.
109	One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to a single source, Daniel Fessler.
109	In the early 1990s, Fessler, then president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures: the troubled England-Wales Power Pool.
109	How strange.
109	Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity than Americans.
109	That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200 percent to 2,000 percent.
109	In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years.
109	The promise lasted several months, during which time five giant international electricity sellers - all new to California - imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain that were designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year.
109	The deregulation bug is now winging eastward.
109	New York City, for example, has reportedly succumbed to 43 percent increases in Con Edison bills.
109	But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened.
109	This month, thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott.
109	The power companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses won't pay.
109	Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school district and - without a hint of shame - Steve Peace, the state senator who sponsored the deregulation law.
109	The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's campaign.
109	After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace.
109	And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas, which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of the GreenMountain, a power seller.
109	But while Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against "powerful forces," on this subject he's mum.
109	No wonder: the Clinton-Gore administration still promotes California-style deregulation as a model for the nation.
109	But someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it's not good news for Gore.
109	During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising.
109	Electricity is the first big U.S. industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules.
109	For the first time, Americans feel the bite of real globalization, and we don't like it one bit.
110	did they bite (i.e., commerce one)?
110	i'm very excited.
110	you hear about the announcement this AM re: Ariba/IBM hooking up with Microsoft to create B2B software?
111	I'm faxing the final to you.
112	Could you please set up a conference call and send the information to the list below?
112	Please set it up for tomorrow, Wednesday, at 9 AM PDT, for one hour.
112	Thank you very much.
112	Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Dave Parquet, Samuel
113	Apologies.
113	Forgot the subject of the meeting.
113	It's "Strategy for California."
114	I'm available.
115	Thanks for keeping us in the loop.
115	Good luck.
116	dome was cool.
116	studied, got some shit cleaned up (cut up logs, torn down deck, etc.), picked lots of apples from my trees!
116	they're so good.
116	made to apple pies with your folks last nite.
116	one's at your house--apples, too.
116	picked some killer huckles--gave them to your mom.
116	dove for abalone---water was HORRIBLE, though.
116	ate it last nite.
116	one in your refrigerator.
116	got killed in the pool.
116	annie ate rat poison, had to drive to S.R.
116	sunday nite; got back about midnight.
116	you know, same ol' shit.
116	you?
117	Mary: FYI.
117	Ms Mara's back.
117	Please include her on everything, too.
117	Thanks a million.
117	Best, Jeff
118	You're welcome.
118	When would you like to talk re: Mr. Bray?
118	And please give me your number again---I've switched computers and gone to Windows 2000.
118	What a bloody mess.
118	Best, Jeff
119	Here it is.
119	And I have JUST been informed that I have to be on a conference call tomorrow from 1-2.
119	Could we do our call at noon or 2 pm California time?
119	Sorry for the inconvenience.
119	Best, Jeff
120	You're a gem.
121	jackasses?
121	that might not be a word we'd want to use in emails that might, shall we say, get into unfriendly hands....
122	Given that the hearing is Friday, we'll need to decide pretty quickly.
122	Might be useful to discuss on a call first thing tomorrow AM?
122	We'll want to assure that our message is tracks consistently with message J. Skilling will be delivering this week and with other messages we'llbe delivering (e.g., FERC inquiry).
122	Also, attached are some messages that Jim distributed following a focus group conducted in Orange County.
123	Greetings: As part of our final tariff filing, we need to submit "sample" forms for things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill and New Service Orders.?
123	Do we have any?
123	Have we had to file any elsewhere?
123	If not, do we want Bowen & Co. to "create" some for us to review, or do we prefer to find the right folks internal to EBS and create them internally?
123	Make sense to arrange a 15-30 minute call to discuss how to execute?
123	All opinions, views, etc. are encouraged and welcome.
123	Best, Jeff
124	Ain't seen the joint resolution, thought my in-box is a mess.
124	Did you send that around?
125	Could you please see if you can get a copy (electronic) preferably of this?
125	Greatly appreciated.
126	done at 9:30.
126	can you pick me up.
126	i'd love it.
126	check your voicemail, too.
126	i left a message there.
127	Been out all day.
127	Will get a copy.
127	I believe that Jeff's suspicions are dead on.
127	Given all the investigations regarding electricity "price spikes" in California, seems very likely that Edison feels the timing is right to push the gas issue.
127	Will confirm that it is targeted solely at El Paso and get back to you either way.
127	If there's anything else, just holler.
127	Will keep you apprised of events as they occur.
127	Best, Jeff
128	I can wait a little bit.
128	But let's coordinate, OK?
129	glad to hear that you're back, generalissimo.
129	we will follow you up the hill.
129	seriously, though, you will start seeing/hearing from us quite soon., e.g., skilling's at the national press club this thursday.
130	Hi Darlin': Thanks again for everything last night.
130	All kidding aside, I wish you all the best with your procedure tomorrow.
130	I'll be sending lots of positives vibes your way all day, and I'm sure we'll be up to see you this weekend.
130	Best, Jeff
131	No duplication.
131	With both of us trying to dig up a copy, we're sure to find one!
131	Best, Jeff
132	sorry, your mom kept the huckles.
133	Will do.
134	I will check.
134	Good chance that I will be there, too.
135	Jessie: Steve Kean and I need to be at the following address on the 11th: County Adminstration Center Building, 1600 Pacific Highway in San Diego.
135	Can you recommend a hotel that's near by and tolerable.
135	Much appreciated.
135	Best, Jeff
136	My pleasure.
136	Sounds like he's got a big job---glad that Enron can help....
137	OK.
138	Getting you the info by the end of the week, or sooner, will not be a problem.
139	you might want to try using a landline phone, sweetie.
139	only 35 cents.
139	works great.
140	did you burn the man?
140	are we having lunch?
140	are you famous now?
141	i love you very much and miss you.
142	tomorrow is absolutely horrible for me.
142	let's talk in the am.
142	perhaps you and mona, sue and sandi can cover sans moi.
143	Haven't had a chance to read yet, but wanted to get to folks ASAP.
144	don't apologize.
144	more interesting when your blood boils.
145	Jessie Knight, the CEO of the S.D.
145	Chamber of Commerce recommends: Stay at the hotel right here where the Chamber is located.
145	It is one of the best and a 5 minute taxi away for you.
145	It is called the Whyndham (on Broadway).
146	I'm on the phone with Jim now.
146	If you want to contact him, I'd wait 5-10 minutes and give him a call on his cell phone.
147	floated idea.
147	people like.
147	but.....(hate to sound like a broken record) the whole ball of wax from Enron's view regarding sponsorship, streaming, etc., will depend on the agenda/participants).
147	looking forward to the call.
147	i'll only have 60 minutes max, however, so counting on you to facilitate forcefully.
148	Lara: I have rather hastily put this list together.
148	For that I apologize.
148	Hope it is helpful.
148	The things on the list are ones that you've likely already considered.
148	Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California include: 1.
148	POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail markets.
148	The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid.
148	The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors.
148	This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility can favor its subs plants via interconnection?).
148	2.
148	DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG: in California many are pointing to DG as a viable solution to the price spikes.
148	If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.
148	(Recall that in many places, recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs).
148	In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection.
148	This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers.
148	Utility control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG subs.
148	And the same goes for the retail level---remember how SDG&E used interconnection to thwart our deal with South West Marine in San Diego.
148	(Obviously, we're not doing these deals any more, but the interconnection caused us ultimately to lose the commodity deal, too.) 4.
148	TRADING PG&E and Sempra have developed significant trading units.
148	Now that the utilities have been granted authority to buy outside the PX, the trading subs are getting more aggressive and vocal about the opportunity to sell the utility power via short and long term power contracts.
148	Again, any sort of favoritism could do considerable harm to consumers and competition (through the shareholders of the utilities' parent would surely profit).
148	5.
148	DISTRIBUTION In general, the utilities control over distribution is complete and it's a problem (see DG, above, for example).
148	Shouldn't state and federal policy makers at least consider doing the equivalent of FERC Order 888 (i.e., open access) at the distribution level?
148	Right now, distribution is a real black box.
148	6.
148	RETAIL In California, the utility effectively controls customer sign-up, switching, information, and turn back.
148	The problems have been significant.
148	7.
148	MARKET INSTITUTIONS Finally, a big mistake in California was to replace one monopoly--the Because the utility has been forced to buy from the PX, and because the market structure in California gives customers no incentive to switch, the utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in California.
148	This gives the utilities monopsony power.
148	With that power, they can influence PX prices.
148	Solution: 1) Don't make the PX a monopoly.
148	2) Create a system that provides customers with the incentive to switch.
148	If you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate.
148	Best, Jeff
149	Plz see email.
149	Sent you info for u & Rick.
149	Best, Jeff
150	Hi Kevin: Got your message.
150	I will be at the FERC hearing on Tuesday.
150	You like me to fill you in on what transpires?
150	Best, Jeff
151	in conf.

155	will that's some good news.
155	thanks.
156	Sue Mara called from the ISO: The Market Issues Committee rejected lowering the price cap from $250.
156	The Market Issues Committe of the Board voted to extend the ISO price cap authority beyond October 15th, with no end date.
156	ISO Board will vote on these issues tomorrow.
156	75% chance that the ISO Board will adopt the Issues Committe's recommendations.
157	pleasure's all mine.
157	anything else i can do, just holler.
158	EBS Update Congressional and FERC hearings in S.D.
158	next week Gas Update
159	As you know, I have great interest.
159	However, I've checked flight schedules to come out Tuesday night, and to put it mildly, it's very ugly.
159	Seems like alot to arrive in D.C. around 3 AM only to turn around and head back to the left coast the next day at 3-4 PM.
159	But I think the meeting should go ahead and take place anyway.
159	Is there any chance that Lisa could get a phone in your meeting room so that I could participate by conference call?
159	Sorry for the headache.
159	Let me know.
159	Thanks again for the chat this PM.
159	Best, Jeff
160	Great food for thought.
160	Thanks.
160	My only concern is timing.
160	Likely to be spending the balance of the week (tomorrow and Friday) on prep for the FERC/House subcomittee hearings.
160	We can discuss further on the staff meeting call tomorrow.
161	FYI.
161	Under the settlement with SoCal, PG&E and countless others, Altra was going to provide the platform for the (unregulated) secondary markets in intrastate storage, capacity and imbalance trading rights.
161	Altra declined and SoCal and PG&E will now look for someone else to provide the service.
162	Dear Ms Leisure: If you're still tanning, and still up for lunch, I'm game.
162	Besides, I owe you a beer.
162	Let me know.
162	Don't work too hard, Best, Jeff
163	ferget it.
163	i'm just as swamped.
163	i don't care if you've got a goddamed boyfriend and a busy job.
163	friday we're having coffee.
163	for 30 rotten minutes.
163	you name the place and the time.
163	hugs and kisses,
164	Thanks, Sue.
164	Agreed.
164	Also, I met today with Bowen & Co. re: interconnection.
164	We have some decisions to make on that front, too, which will also require a bit of discussion.
164	Tracy, I'm sure that Scott's in Istanbul and Donald's in Marrakesh.
164	Could you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a conference call for next Wedneday (hopefully, that's ample lead time)?
164	Finally, the draft final tariff (in strike-out-underline form) will be ready for review by COB Friday.
164	I'll email it around.
164	Hope all is well with all.
164	Best, Jeff
165	Please keep the following confidential.
165	Jessie Knight called.
165	Here's the latest.
165	Seems the Chamber of Commerce is going to launch a campaign with the following messages: 1) Deregulation must go forward, not back.
165	2) The transition will continue to be a bit bumpy.
165	3) The best option businesses and families have is to switch to an alternative service provider.
165	The Chamber has cut deals with ESPs (I didn't get all the details, but sounds like an exclusive) according to which the Chamber will aggregate customers and deliver them to the ESPs.
165	I believe that The New Power Company will be one of those ESPs.
165	Ray McNally's sister, who is one of our very satisfied rez customers in S.D., will appear at the press conference with the Chamber to announce the program.
165	They are attempting to launch the program and have the press conference this week.
165	The Chamber is also launching a program to educate S.D.
165	politicians and business leaders on the benefits of retail choice and how to benefit from it.
165	The Chamber is still looking for a business customer to appear with them at the press conference.
166	just goe your email.
166	all go well?
166	415.782.7822.
167	Thanks.
167	We're on the same page.
167	Already notified folks.
167	But given the witch hunt, figured we'd sit back and let things run their course.
168	can you give me a call when you get a minute---415.782.7822.
168	Thanks a bunch.
169	Paul and Lysa: I want to apologize in advance.
169	It now seems that FERC has realized that it has a biz meeting in D.C. on the 13th, which makes having a meeting in San Diego on the 12th somewhat difficult.
169	So, if FERC changes the date (again) and pushes the meeting back, I'll go to S.D.
169	on the 11th to see Steve Kean testify and fly to D.C. on the evening of the 11th or morning of the 12th and attend Paul's meeting in person.
169	If they don't change the date and it stays on the 12th, I won't go to D.C. and will participate in Paul's meeting on the 12th in D.C. by phone.
169	I'll let you know what FERC decides, when it decides it.
169	Exasperatedly yours, Jeff
170	Looks good.
170	I vote yes.
171	would seem useful if we all contribute in some manner, but i'm open to suggestions.
171	perhaps we could divvy up the questions.
172	I'll be in S.D.
172	on Monday to watch.
172	What time do you go on?
173	Ariba Hits Some Speed Bumps on the Fast-Growth Highway By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 9/7/00 3:21 PM ET URL: SAN FRANCISCO -- In a sign that the business-to-business software game is tough even when you're on top, Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq) has been running into problems this summer, both at home and abroad.
173	Ariba told analysts and investors at a private breakout session here Tuesday at the Robertson Stephens Internet Conference that its business in Europe this summer has been "soft," according to Eric Upin, an analyst at the firm.
173	And at home, analysts are starting to talk about problems the company has had integrating its Tradex software into its own and customers' systems.
173	An Ariba spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking a comment.
173	The challenges Ariba is facing illustrate how difficult it can be to stay ahead of the game in an emerging industry, even for one of its most aggressive leaders.
173	And they come at a time when its main competitor, Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), is gaining momentum in key markets -- including Europe -- through its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR).
173	Upin, who rates Ariba a buy and lists the company as one of his top B2B picks, says the new concerns have to be taken in context.
173	(His firm hasn't performed underwriting for the company.) "Ariba's just getting ramped up in Europe, and Europe's slow during the summer. It's a tiny part of their business," Upin said.
173	"But there was concern because Ariba was saying that business was soft [in Europe] in August."
173	That concern has been reflected in Ariba's stock, which is trading just under $162, off from its Sept. 1 close of $166.25.
173	It fell 6.1% Wednesday after the breakout session, though it's up about 3% Thursday.
173	With the stock trading at more than 70 times next year's projected sales, it's priced to perfection.
173	Ariba's softness in Europe comes at a time when Commerce One has been making strides there.
173	Its partnership with SAP has resulted in six new customers so far.
173	Commerce One also announced a joint marketing and sales alliance with Intershop, another German software maker, on Thursday.
173	At home, Ariba has been encountering problems in integrating its Tradex software, which enables users to participate in auctions over the Internet, into its customers' systems, as well as into its own software platform.
173	Ian Toll, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, says those problems shouldn't be viewed as too much of an impediment for Ariba.
173	But they do illustrate the complexities of building software that is designed to do everything from manage back-office accounting systems to trade real-time with outside partners.
173	"Implementation has certainly been a concern with Tradex," Toll said.
173	"Certain Tradex customers have highlighted what appear to be longer time lines than they had hoped for. But I think that's true across competing vendors as well."
173	(Toll rates Ariba a buy, and his firm hasn't done underwriting for the company.) While Ariba issued a news release Thursday crowing about how drugstore operator CVS (CVS:NYSE) recently went live on its Ariba Buyer software in just 60 days, observers say that getting Tradex installed and working is taking closer to six months.
173	In the hard-charging world of B2B, that's an eternity.
173	Ariba completed its acquisition of Tradex in March.
173	Ariba has hailed the acquisition as one that gives it best-of-breed auction capability, which it would integrate into its own suite of software products.
173	But competitors, most notably Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq), pooh-poohed the deal, saying that stringing together complex technologies through acquisitions is easier said than done.
173	And in its most recent quarterly results release, when it reported record revenue of $80.7 million that was backed up by $153 million in deferred revenue, the company cautioned that integration of Tradex could be a stumbling point.
173	In the release's boilerplate section that noted that actual results could differ from projections, Ariba said those differences could result from, among other things, "difficulties in assimilating companies recently acquired, including Tradex."
173	Despite the problems, though, analysts are still positive on the company.
173	"Ariba could be the next Oracle," Robbie Stephens' Upin said.
173	"And there were quarters when Oracle promised and didn't deliver or it missed altogether. But even for an Ariba, there will be those bumps along the road."
173	But as competition increases in the B2B sector, those bumps are getting more pronounced.
174	Looks like I won't be going to Washington, but I will participate in the strategy meeting by phone on the 12th.
175	Folks: My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.
175	Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.
175	I have been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note to Littlechild.
175	I have been working to try to establish a joint venture between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an "energy summit," where national and international energy leaders would converge on California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.
175	Jim Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.
175	In short,, our goal was to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde notions of "turn the clock back" that the Governor of California's two most recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past several months, and re-seize the agenda in California.
175	The "energy heads of state" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.
175	The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on proposals I have made to the "steering committee."
175	However, for reasons I won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a fiasco.
175	I notified the group this week that Enron would not be participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came to agreement on the agenda and particpants.
175	From my perspective, the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment.
175	I urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s.
175	At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay participate.
175	Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may or may not want to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm pessimistic at this point.
175	If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.
175	I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.
175	But the forum that these folks are creating ain't the right one.
175	Best, Jeff
176	Rick: Thanks very much.
177	Thanks very much.
178	Thanks, Cynthia.
178	Extreme rhetoric likely from Ms Lynch, CPUC Prez, UCAN and Sempra chief (Steve Baum).
178	Rest of panel looking pretty good.
178	Might be useful to let Smutney do at least the lion's share of the "responding" to Ms Lynch's and Mr. Baum's rabid attacks on generators.
178	Smutney's had a lot of practice in the last couple of months and he's close to the issue.
178	But, of course, a few well placed jabs, couldn't hurt....
179	I do plan on accompanying Steve.
179	Steve, you want me to bring the copies.
179	Be glad to.
179	What time does the party start?
180	Attached are the draft message points.
180	As always, all comments, suggestions, etc. are encouraged and welcome.
180	I have five minutes.
180	Consequently, based on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to round things out.
180	Joe/Mary: any final word on format/participants?
180	Thanks.
180	Best, Jeff
181	Do we know what time the party starts?
182	i'll call my folks right now.
183	just remembered that my folks are in connecticutt.
183	if you want to go to the game, i'll go with you.
183	can you call me (from a land line phone)?
184	Hi.
184	I'm going to forward you a bunch of stuff, starting with this.
184	Hope you and yours are doing well.

186	Greetings folks.
186	We should decide how we want to handle.
186	One thing I'm not clear on and that I couldn't find in the syllabus is, what's the format for the write up?
186	If we're called on to discuss, do we simply discuss orally, some sort of simplistic PP slides, spreadsheets, other?
186	Anyway to discuss between now and Monday, or do we want to just take Dylan up on his offer?
186	Best, Jeff
187	If there's other stuff you need, or if you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate.
187	Best, Jeff
188	Greetings.
188	Kim's stuff looks pretty good to me.
188	There's a pretty high likelihood though that I won't be in class Monday or Tuesday either.
188	That means I can't turn in whatever it is we're turning in tomorrow (if I sound clueless, it might be because he ran out of handouts in the first class describing how the cases would work, and there's nothing posted on the site--apologies).
188	I can do the write-up for next week.
189	Thanks, Dylan.
189	In the event I can't make to either class, I'm available Wed and Thur evening to discuss the next case.
189	And as I mentioned, I'd be happy to write that one up.
189	Best, Jeff
190	Thanks very much.
190	Now I just need to get the workspace view I had before you had to re-install notes.
190	Best, Jeff
191	I think the answer to #1 is: as much as possible, but I'm not altogether certain--pretty sure that our preference would be to use our own internal construction folks as much as possible.
191	Answer to #2 would be very interesting; I don't know the answer, but I'm sure that it's tightly linked to the answer to #1.
191	I think you might want to start with Shelly Corman to find the right contact for the pipeline constructions.
191	I leave for S.D.
191	tonite.
191	I'll give you updates as the day transpires tomorrow.
191	Best, Jeff
192	Didn't receive your attachements.
192	Only got the ones Kim had already sent.
192	Did you just modify those, or create a new document?
193	I'd say, "What next?", but I'm afraid to ask....
193	Regarding our California strategy, preventing the merger would seem to be right up there with "end the price caps" in our list of priorities.
193	At today's FERC hearing, a hair-brained consumer advocate called for merging the PX and the ISO.
193	During the panel I was on, I made the point that a merger would make California's problems worse than they are today.
193	The FERC Commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns.
193	P.S.
193	After the panel, Heber lobbied me hard to support transcos.
193	DJ Freeman Sees Cal/ISO, PX Merger, Lower Price Cap Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. By Jason Leopold SAN DIEGO (Dow Jones) -- David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO and the California Power Exchange.
193	Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday.
193	An informal consensus among the board has already approved his membership.
193	Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like to see it reduced below $100/MWh.
193	"I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious generation shortage problem," Freeman said.
193	Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones.
193	The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for itself in return.

194	Apologies.
194	I invariably leave someone of the damned list.
195	Jim: After today's hearing, I think you're note is dead on.
195	Let's talk.
195	I'm in the office tomorrow.
195	Miss seeing you all in D.C. Best, Jeff
196	Hey darlin'.
196	How are you?
196	Bet NYC is mighty nice this time of year.
196	Hope to get there real soon.
196	Best to you and your better half, Jeff
197	Can we talk before you bring it up with SoCal?
197	Very interesting about Herr Cherry.
197	Hadn't heard.
197	I'm coming out soon to see you guys.
198	It would be great to get Bryson.
199	sit tight.
200	I don't have the name of the CFO at Sempra, though I'm sure he's on their website.
200	If not, let me know.
201	Thanks, Jim.
201	We'll monitor.
201	Best, Jeff
202	Thanks, Ron.
202	Greatly appreciated.
202	For my part, please feel free to forward along any articles.
202	Best, Jeff
203	FYI.
203	Kahn's heading up the "power plant streamlining" task force.
203	At yesterday's FERC hearing, Mike was put in the position of reading word for word a statement by the governor (even had to read it in the first person).
203	Awkward to say the least.
203	And Mike wasn't prepared at all to answer the questions he got on the statement from the FERC commissioners, particularly from Heber.
203	"I don't know" came up a lot.
204	Never mentioned the CFO.
204	Let's discuss further.
204	I can get you in.
205	FYI.
205	Please take a look.
205	I would not be inclined to sign the letter.
205	Thoughts?
205	Best, Jeff
206	See page 46 of the PDF file, Article 10 "nonutility power providers."
206	that's where sec.
206	390 is.
207	Not a problem, Jimmie.
207	About this week's case.
207	Been travelling.
207	I'm back.
207	Kim: in your absence on Monday, we talked a little about how to proceed on the next case.
207	How's this sound: everyone takes a question.
207	If the answer to one question depends on the answer to another, the folks doing those questions should get together and discuss.
207	Everyone should distribute to the team a draft of the answer to the question by tomorrow (Thursday) night.
207	Then folks could look at the responses, make suggestions, comments, etc. and distribute via email by Noon on Saturday.
207	I'll then compile in a form that we can submit on Monday.
207	Thoughts?
207	I have randomly selected questions: here are the results.
207	Jeff--#3; Jimmie--#1; Kim--#2; Dylan--#4.
207	If folks are comfortable with this distribution, let me know.
207	Best, Jeff
208	Looks good.
208	Couple of proposed edits.
209	Forgive the length, but it was a long couple of days.
209	Apologies in advance, since I'm sure I've missed something.
209	Hopefully, it hits the highlights and gives a good flavor.
209	Please foreward to anyone I've inadvertently missed.
209	Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
209	Best, Jeff
210	Thanks for the update.
210	Just want to add that 1) if we're uneasy about wearing the full requirements risk, then focusing on offering a purely wholesale deal can still be very attractive, given SDG&E's blunders w.r.t.
210	procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers.
210	And 2) the CPUC has been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge, so they'll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to pre-approve if a deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and that looks"attractive."
210	Appreciate being kept in the loop on the details.
210	Thanks.
210	Best, Jeff
211	Thanks.
212	plz call when you can.
212	thanks, jeff 415.782.7822.
213	The CPUC can do it it it wants---it's a decision about risk and reward.
213	If the CPUC wants to set up a mechanism by which pre-approval is permitted, it can do so.
213	Here's the catch, pre-approval means that the IOU has to be willing (generally) to accept a bit more risk.
213	They don't like that.
213	The CPUC has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this Commission definitely doesn't like that idea.
213	So often, the utility puts up a proposal that the Commission says places to much risk with granny.
213	The CPUC often issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control (read "second-guessing") with the Commission (and therefore leaves to much risk with the utility).
213	In the end, the utility often "declines" the Commission's offer.
213	However, it can be done.
213	For example, under California's restructuring law, the utility's purchases from the PX are just and reasonable, period.
213	(Of course, we see where the incentive built into that mechanism got us--a debacle.) Do you have PG&E's and Edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some weeks ago, in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms?
213	The Commission didn't adopt them wholesale, and the decision has made PG&E and Edison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful RFPs.
213	This at all helpful?
214	Honey, I really want to come, but my homework is due to my group tonite and I haven't even started it.
214	I love you tons and hope you understand.
214	Please call your mom.
214	She was a pain on the phone today, saying there's no need to remove the stumps at the dome.
214	Jeff's willing to do ALL THREE for $350.
214	It's just ridiculous and I am having a hard time haggling anymore.
214	I love you tons.
214	And if you want to talk more about dinner, please call me.
214	I'm sorry, but there's just too darned much to do.
214	(I think my cold's getting worse, not better. :(
215	thanks very much for the info.
215	certainly makes it interesting.
215	how's things?
215	P.S.
215	do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM and made a whopping $415 MM!!!
215	Are they gouging San Diegans?
215	Are they "gaming" the system?
215	Inquiring minds want to know.
215	You may want to check in with Smutney when Edison made the statement.
215	There may be nothing to it, but it might be interesting to check into.
215	Is Edison one of those "profiteers" who ought to give San Diegans a refund?
216	10 AM works for me.
217	Needs to know before your parents leave for Mexico, which is tomorrow, unfortunately.
217	I guess I'll be at my house.
217	You want to stay there, or you want to stay at your place?
217	Either way's OK with me.
218	FYI.
218	In case you're interested.
219	Who are John and Kittina?
219	Who are the others you've invited?
219	What's the occasion?
219	When's your anniversary?
219	Why is there a foie gras shortage?
220	Good points, Chris, and well taken.
220	The PUC Commisisoners took some heat for their heavy-handed approach at hearings held by Congress on Monday and FERC on Tuesday.
220	I think those hearings may have loosened things the Commission up at least somewhat, though finding a balance between Commission willingness to grant pre-approval and utility willingness to wear some risk in exchange won't be a cakewalk.
220	We need to remind the Commission that they gave 100 % pre-approved reasonableness for purchases from the PX, and that pre-approval for other purchases is necessary.
220	That said, I concur that it ain't a gimmee.
220	Best, Jeff
221	Not a problem.
221	the schedule was only a suggestion.
221	work it in when you can.
221	and if you get totally fried, just say so, and we can take on the question.
222	i love you.
222	thanks for being so sweet.
223	How long you going for?
223	I'm jealous.
224	Thanks.
224	The hearings were tiresome, but hanging out with you and Steve was a real treat.
224	Hope to do it again soon.
224	You probably noticed that, in my summary, I made no mention of the shoes that I was wearing.....
224	Best, Jeff
225	now i'm really jealous.
225	let me see what i can muster up for you on tuscany.
225	o, jealous am I.
226	can you talk to sandi?
226	she's on vacation beginning on monday.
226	the idea wathat she and i should get together before she left (based on the call we hawhere Rick and Paul put the ball in my and sandi's court to coordinate thestrategy).
226	she suggested that it would also be a good idea to grab whoeverwas here tomorrow, too.
226	it's really just a prelim meeting to discuss thenote that sandi sent around and for me to bounce a few ideas off of her.
226	we'll be having many, many more, and nothing discussed in tomorrow's "kickoff" will set anything in stone.
226	that said, if you prefer that we wait, that's ok with me.
227	thanks.
228	PG&E's $2 Billion Power Grab We've been gulled by our greedy utility Ken Garcia ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle URL: SAN FRANCISC -- The executives at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sure try hard to live up to their name, because I can't think of any company that has been more adept at giving consumers a jolt.
228	The doyens of greed that rule over the California utility giant recently revealed that they hope to pass on to customers more than $2 billion in expenses -- ``unforeseen costs'' in the euphemistic view of the power company, but unjustifiable rate increases to those of us residing in real world.
228	The consumer-soaking surge is apparently based on PG&E's inability to predict a rise in wholesale electricity prices, which is costing the company about $700 million a month.
228	Yet, as usual, the utility giant wants us to forget all past promises and obligations, a favorite technique of energy merchants who see rate increases as something that can be turned on with the flick of a switch.
228	Lest anyone forget, a utility rate increase is exactly what California's customers were told they would not get as a result of a deregulated power market, which was supposed to lower -- not raise -- energy bills because of an expected increase in competition.
228	It shouldn't come as a surprise that our friends at PG&E were among the prime architects of the state's deregulation policy, which they now want to bend in their financial favor.
228	This is known as having your cake and (billing) Edith too, because certainly she and her fellow customers wouldn't want the utility company's stock to fall.
228	Now, I realize PG&E has been prone to blackouts over the years, but just because it doesn't like the deal it forged and signed a few years back, doesn't mean that its customers should be forced to pay for its lapses in judgment.
228	If you want to dance, you have to pay the fiddler -- even if it turns out to be Nero and the electrical lines are burning.
228	``It should be PG&E that eats the costs because they made the initial promise that rates would go down,'' Dan Jacobson of the California Public Interest Research Group told The Chronicle the other day.
228	And he's right, even if the state Public Utilities Commission once again buckles under and decides to give PG&E a break it doesn't deserve.
228	While PG&E CEO Robert Glynn was trying to assuage analysts on Wall Street this week that the soaring electricity rates would indeed be passed on to customers, The Chronicle revealed that the state Board of Equalization has quietly been granting utilities and giant corporations billions of dollars in tax breaks.
228	Despite a booming economy, the state agency has inexplicably reduced the property tax assessments of PG&E, Pacific Bell and others to the tune of $5.3 billion in the past year alone.
228	That's a lot of lost kilowatts and phone calls that could be used by California residents.
228	But in the world of utilities, it's always best to leave the consumer in the dark.
228	In effect, the equalization board is improperly granting huge tax breaks to companies worth billions, at the same time its assessments on homes and small commercial properties are skyrocketing.
228	And if you think something smells a little rotten here -- well, it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of consumers' ears.
228	You don't have to look far to see why officials at PG&E are feeling a little desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as quickly as possible.
228	Because the faster they can do it, the faster customers might forget that PG&E had asked the PUC for an $800 million rate increase earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning.
228	The utility was granted a $450 million increase, even though an administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount to meet its expenses.
228	But what's a few hundred million between friends?
228	Yet the funny part is, PG&E officials said that rate increase would actually lower our gas and electric bills, an event that happens on our shores about as often as a tsunami.
228	This energy-defying trick, which I first questioned in February, would take place, we were told, because of cost savings within the utility giant's other divisions.
228	Yet if they were making more money, why did PG&E need the PUC to give it close to a half billion in bill increases?
228	Well, the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs making decisions about California's energy market, and Gov. Gray Davis hasn't seen fit to replace them.
228	So don't be shocked if PG&E again gets its way, and once again customers are ``serviced'' by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate increases, no matter how unfair or undeserved.
228	PG&E said it would foot the bill when it pushed for deregulation, and now that it's taking a huge hit for past decisions, it wants to pass the buck.
228	It takes time to build up a reputation for Power, Greed & Excess.
228	Energy companies, after all, are anything but utilitarian.

229	FYI.
230	will do.
231	don't know.
231	check out the website, which is where registration is.
231	there's lots on B2B, e.g., biz models/technologies.
231	i registered.
231	if i win the lottery you can likely persuade me to give you my ticket, or i can try to get one from someone who wins but can't go, or hopefully you can register and win one for yourself.
231	check out the site.
232	We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.
232	But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
232	OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.
232	The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."
232	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.
232	His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds."
232	On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
232	And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
232	At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds.
232	Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon.
232	The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.
232	On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
232	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
232	He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.
232	IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.
232	In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.
232	In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered.
232	In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.
233	Needless to say, given the Governor's press release, I'm a little concerned about what he might want.
233	Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable at the FERC hearing.
233	Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up on the them.
233	I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something between now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be bold (understanding that "bold" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's the chance.
233	Thanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.
233	He was very gracious throughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, saying, "Jeff, I let you off the hook. I was going to ask you how in the hell you ever let California turn into such a mess."
233	I told him that we were exercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy "I told you so" statements.
233	Best, Jeff
234	Well, I was clearly too ambitious in setting out the schedule.
234	My apologies.
234	I managed to trudge through the reading and the document last night, but didn't not get to answering the question.
234	I appears that this will be a busy weekend.
234	I've a feeling that I won't get my proposed answer to folks until Saturday afternoon for your review.
234	If that poses a problem for anyone, please let me know.
234	I still intend to be the compiler of wisdom, so folks should feel free to distribute when they've got something drafted.
234	Best, Jeff
235	My apologies, but as you can imagine, California's little crisis has me a bit preoccupied.
235	Would love to know what comes out of the meeting, though.
235	Best, Jeff
236	I understand that we may have no choice in the matter, but having wtinessed Loretta Lynch's inability to define market power when asked to do so by Joe Barton last Monday, and, having heard Carl Wood declare war on capitalism at FERC's hearing on Tuesday, and, knowing that the likes of Harvey Morse (PUC FERC attorney), who has never come down on the side of "no market power here" in any analysis, is "heading up" the PUC investigation, and seeing Gov Davis' press releases demanding refunds from the faceless, out-of-state suppliers I'm, well, maybe a little nervous about them getting their paws on our data.
236	Jeff
237	Thanks for the offer Ms Kupiecki, but since you carried so much of the weight last case, I feel obliged to compile this time round.
238	It works!
239	in office mon, tues, wed.
239	perhaps houston thur/fri.
240	Sorry.
240	They're on their way.
240	(P.S. It's Kean, not Kane.) And I like to discuss further the points you were making on the call.
240	They were good ones.
240	I just didn't want to get hung up on them during that conference call.
240	Best, Jeff
241	1) Since I'm coming, I'll likely stay a couple of days, if there's still an open seat available on the floor.
241	2) I can get a plane that arrives at Intercontinental at 12:20.
241	Can I catch a cab and get to the Woodlands by 1?
241	Otherwise, I'll come out the night before.
241	Best, Jeff
242	Thanks.
242	See you then.
242	Hope it turns out that your guts are in good order.
242	I'm feeling like I could use a transplant myself.
242	Best, Jeff
243	you STILL there?!
244	Mike: Here's the memo on PX-based pricing for QFs that we discussed.
244	If you have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch.
244	Best, Jeff
245	Run!
245	While there's still time.
245	And get on the call with Paul.
245	It starts in 1 minute.
246	Hi.
246	How's things?
246	Long time no see.
247	yes, too busy.
247	very disappointed that i didn't get to see everyone.
247	hope all is well.
248	Thanks so much for the info.
248	This is very useful.
248	I will try to make the next meeting.
248	Hopefully the crisis out here will be over by then.
248	How would you structure it differently next time?
248	Best, Jeff Enron Energy Services
249	Congratulation, Pat.
249	And the very best of luck.
249	See you soon.
249	Best, Jeff
250	give a call.
250	415.782.7822.
251	Got it.
251	Thanks.
251	I'll be sending mine around later this afternoon.
251	Best, Jeff
252	Greetings.
252	Looks like our questions (2&3) are linked.
252	You around to chat for a couple of minutes?
252	I'll likely eyeball the numbers to see what cash gives in order to answer #3.
252	Let me know.
252	Hope all's well.
252	Best, Jeff
253	one other thing.
253	what's your home number?
254	Here's my cut at #3.
254	I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer, but made some assumptions and took a shot.
254	Likely to doctor it up a bit, but wanted to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think I've lost my mind.
254	Let me know.
254	#3 is somewhat at the heart of the questions, so I want to make sure that I get your feedback.
254	And my apologies for not having gotten you something sooner.
254	Be on the look out, there is a cold going around that really kicked my butt over the last week.
254	Best, Jeff
255	rams = 15 (last man standing)
256	Greetings.
256	Here's the case with 1,3 and 4 compiled.
256	I took some editorial license with 1 and 4--hope I didn't butcher what you were conveying Jimmie and Dylan.
256	Check it out.
256	Still need to determine if folks are comfortable with my conclusion in #3, i.e., look, the biz model and the info provided in the 10K may be crap, but from a strictly technical perspective, Patten's justified in using the sales as opposed to the installment method.
256	Let me know.
256	Kim's up and running on #2.
256	Best, Jeff
257	check it out.
257	i've taken a stab at compiling 1, 3 and 4.
257	folks comfortable with my conclusion regarding sales v. installment method?
257	best, Jeff
258	i'm in mendocino: number's 707.884.4608 if you need to chat.
258	best,
259	Hey, nice spreadsheet.
259	Two minor questions: 1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?
259	I think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.
259	If so, I think they actually get a 46% tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose using a cash basis.
259	Still a loss, just not so big.
259	Anyway, I'm not sure if I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.
259	2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?
259	For example, does shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is now a loss, rather than a gain?
259	Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same).
259	Seems like they might need a liability like "deferred profits" or some such thing, such that the ["deferred profits" + revenues (recognized on cash basis)] = notes receivables.
259	Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what you think.
259	Best, Jeff
260	No, I don't think I'd make a better accountant.
260	But I did ask a few questions of my accountant brother-in-law.
260	You did a great job.
260	I don't know how much time I'll have, but I'll see if I can throw in a bit of text and raise the issues.
260	See you tonite.
261	Hi: Hope you had a nice weekend.
261	Sorry I missed you all in Washington.
261	Rick's asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow.
261	Do we have a list of attendants/agenda?
261	No big deal, but would help me in preparing for the meeting.
261	I'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only?
261	I'm staying through Wednesday, nonetheless, and have booked a room at the Lancaster.
261	But if the meeting's going to continue through Wed, I was wondering if I should be staying at the Woodlands.
261	Thanks (as always) for you help.
261	Signed, Clueless
262	My understanding is that PG&E is in active talks to cut a deal with legislators and the Governor, but I have no details.
262	Mona, does it make sense to have S. Govenor poke around is Sacramento to see what he can find out?
263	Immensely helpful.
263	Thanks so much.
263	That's all I'll need.
263	FYI.
263	My plane lands at 12:20 and I'll be going directly to the Woodlands.
263	Oh, one thing.
263	If you could get info to Joseph on where the Woodlands is and where I need to go once I arrive there, I'd be eternally indebted.
263	Best, Jeff
264	Rick called and asked me to sit in on a meeting on enegy issues that he's having tomorrow in Houston.
264	Wants me to bring to the table information on gas issues, particularly in light of the SoCalGas settlement here in California.
264	I'll be leaving at the crack of dawn tomorrow monring and will be in Houston on Tuesday/Wednesday and back in the office on Thursday.
265	Agreed 100%--call me an engineer.
266	Our signature should not be on the letter.
266	I'll check and see.
266	I didn't hear back from anyone but you.
267	Will do.
268	Sandi's on vacation this week.
268	There are rumors that PG&E's actively seeking a negotiated solution with legislators and the Governor, but I can't verify and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like.
268	While's Sandi's away, have asked Mona to check in with our Sacramento lobbyists to poke around for information.
268	Will report back soon as we get more info.
269	Thank you very much.
270	Holy moly and hee haw, how the heck are ya, and what are you up to?
271	1) In Nancy's absence, I'd thought I'd keep the interesting-quotes-sharing-practice alive.
271	This one's from John Waters in the NYT: "Show me a kid who's not sneaking into R-rated movies and I'll show you a failure. All the future CEO's of this country are sneaking into R-rated movies."
271	2) Cameron, you are a football pool GENIUS!
272	Oops.
272	I forgot to plug your phone back in after I used my computer this morning.
272	Sorry.
272	Could you call me when you get a chance?
273	Some EES folks just popped into my office and asked me to pop into their meeting, which starts at noon.
273	I'm not sure precisely what the meeting's about, but Mona I noticed you've got it on your weekly schedule.
273	How do you want to handle?
273	I'd be happy to pop in at noon for the meet and greet part, but likely need to leave in order to work on the draft strategy---Paul wants me to distribute whatever I've got done by COB today, which I think is a good idea.
274	Hey, groom-to-be, what happened?
274	So sorry I missed you.
274	The buzz about B. Cherry going to PG&E is starting to get louder.
274	Hope all's well.
274	Best, Jeff
275	Greetings!
275	Couple of things.
275	1) From the notes flying around, it looks like the "word-smithing" of the letter to the Governor continues.
275	We think you folks are doing exactly the right thing in sending a letter.
275	We intend to play an energetic and constructive role in the months ahead to help California come up with solutions that make competition work for everyone.
275	But for a variety of reasons I won't bore you with in this email, we're going to decline signing the letter.
275	If you'd like to discuss, feel free to give me a call at 2) When's the next meeting, and when's the "annual retreat?"
275	All the best, Jeff
276	OK, the powers that be have phoned.
276	I am to be there tomorrow and Wed.
276	Tomorrow I'm huddle at the Woodlands all day.
276	But Wednesday I'll be in the office.
276	Perhaps coffee or lunch?
276	Could you forward to the lovely Ms Scott, since every time I type her name in, I get someone from ECT.
276	Can't wait to hear more about Herr Cherr-y.
276	Best, Jeff
277	I don't know if they have the authority, and I could be wrong, but this looks like an obvious set up by the administration.
277	Hold up a report from your auditor that sez, "it makes now sense to have the two separate, Poolco is the only way to go, and they must be merged."
277	Then legislation is launched, on the basis of the auditor's recommendation, to merge the PX and the ISO in California.
277	Looks like an audit whose message we'll want to pre-empt well in advance of the report going public.
278	It's rough, but Paul and I concluded that, since I'll be in Houston, best that I send out whatever I have by COB today.
278	I will be working on this more on the plane on my way to Houston.
278	Now we have Sandi's, Paul's and this, all of which I think are headed in the same direction and complement one another.
278	We'll need to meld them.
278	Please look at all 3 at the same time.
278	Might be useful to begin an email conversation now with folks comments.
278	I'm reachable and will be back in the office on Thursday.
278	Best, Jeff
279	This is Kathy Franz w/Win2K Desktop Support.
279	I have copied the names and journal.nsf files for Jeff Dasovich to the appropriate locations on the server.
279	They are ready to be copied up to EESHOU-LN1.

279	Please do this ASAP as customer is scheduled to leave at 4pm today.
280	you never need to ask.
280	you can always use me as a reference.
280	what's it for?
281	Be happy to discuss.
281	My preference would be to have a brief call to discuss, since Mr. Filner is on a mission to tan a few hides over the price spikes in S.D.
281	At congressional and FERC hearings in S.D.
281	last week, Mr. Filner called generators and marketers quite a few ugly names, fingered them as the cause for the high prices, and demanded that Congress and FERC make them give all the money back to S.D.
281	consumers.
281	Fairly sensitive item, to put it mildly.
281	I'm at 415.782.7822.
281	Best, Jeff
282	talked to mike h.
282	problem solved.
282	disregard franctic voicemail.

283	FYI.
283	Never heard back from Kevin.
284	let's talk about it tonite.
285	Thank a lot.
286	Test
287	When you moving to S.F.?
287	You excited about the change?
287	What will you be focused on?
287	Congratulations.
287	Sounds like a great opportunity.
288	Hi Dana: Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.
288	Things, as you know, are, well, a little nuts.
288	It was great to meet you and I would be happy to discuss opportunities.
288	I need to be in S.D.
288	in the next few weeks.
288	Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what you folks do.
288	Best, Jeff
289	Well, looks like it's that time again.
289	There only 2 questions.
289	Howzabout if the S.F.
289	contingent takes #1 and the East Bay Gang takes #2 and we distribute around over the weekend?
289	Thoughts?
290	Too hot a market: How energy producers manipulate California (Published Sept. 22, 2000) The priciest place to shop this August in California was in Pasadena.
290	There at the California Power Exchange, where much of the state's electricity is bought and sold, prices that utilities paid for power (an average $166 per megawatt) were up fivefold from the previous August ($32).
290	What is happening?
290	Among other things, too much power on hot days is being purchased in the near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis.
290	Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days, or even months, in advance.
290	How was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work?
290	Much of the action was supposed to take place at the Power Exchange.
290	There vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets.
290	Some utilities would be busy shopping for electricity the next day.
290	Others, depending on their needs, would be squirreling away supply a month, even a year, in advance.
290	Selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities.
290	Under the state's restructuring of electricity, these utilities were obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants, but not necessarily their nuclear or hydroelectric generators.
290	On any given day, up to 95 percent of the power needed to fuel California was supposed to be already purchased.
290	The idea was to leave just a little bit for the last minute.
290	Headquartered in Folsom, the state's entire grid is managed by an agency known as the Independent System Operator.
290	The ISO's job is to buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on.
290	With literally only hours to work with, the ISO is ill-suited to drive hard bargains.
290	The ISO pays up to $250 per megawatt.
290	The problem is that the ISO's spot market is way too big, and too pricey.
290	It is buying up to 30 percent of California's power on some days, particularly hot ones.
290	This August, less power is being purchased in those struggling futures market down in Pasadena.
290	More was being bought in Folsom.
290	This is a telltale sign that California's electricity market is working for those who own power plants, not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise.
291	Thank you.
291	FYI.
291	Seems that the problem was that the last letter in my IZIO login (that comes up automatically when pulling up the page) was being truncated (which may result from my regular work login pre-empting the IZIO login--the two are exactly the same, except that my work login truncates the last letter of my name).
291	Thanks very much for your help.
292	Thanks.
292	Got if fixed.
292	cc: Subject: Re: your mail Greetings Jeff, Sorry for the delay in responding.
292	I would call TJ at Haas (510) 643-0435 and have her help you get to the right person.
292	Kindly, Salvador Assistant Professor, Accounting Director, Executive Education School of Business and Management University of San Francisco 2130 Fulton Street San Francisco, CA 94117
293	Folks: Here's a catalogue of issues that Sue, Mona and I put together using Paul's outline as a guide.
293	Just a start (but a pretty good one), with lots more to do, but it should provide a solid platform to get the strategy completed in short order.
293	Best, Jeff
294	Thank you very much for the tech data.
294	Margaret, is there data out there regarding the California utilities performance (i.e., how many rolling blackouts, etc. v. national average)?
294	Thanks again.
295	you still at school?
295	call me at work.
296	I'll be in town, though i'm going to the "leading edge" deal at haas on sat.
296	morning.
296	home number is 415.621.8317.
297	It's a little far off into the future, but NARUC will be in San Diego on Nov. 12-15 (odd coincidence?).
297	Might be a good place to do some messaging.
298	Let's try this.
298	Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.
298	I won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.
298	And if someone does, the other needs to bring it up.
298	But Prentice, if I say, "that's critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.
298	So I'm willing to have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, too.
298	I hope you'll going sailing today.
298	Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?
298	I also left my gym bag in your bathroom, which has my sailing shoes in it.
298	I'm at work.
298	You can call me here.
299	Kim: Been having horrible computer problems.
299	(Just got switched over to Windows 2000---I hate Microsoft; break it up into a million itty bitty pieces.) Haven't had a chance to read what you wrote.
299	Attaching what I cobbled together yesterday.
299	Will also take a look at what Mr. Jackson put together.
299	You should feel free to go ahead and meld mine and yours, etc. I'm at work.
299	Will be here until about 11-11:30.
299	After that, if you need me, page me at 888.916.7184.
299	And thanks a million for pulling it together.
299	Best, Jeff
300	Forgot to attach the file.
300	Here it is.
301	If there is any possibility of doing it on Wednesday and Thursday, that would work much better with my schedule, but I can be flexible if necessary.
301	Thanks very much for coordinating.
301	Best, Jeff
302	Yes, agree that another call to weave in the comments we received from the biz units would be useful.
302	Can we shoot for Wednesday, when Mr. Kaufman will be here in the SF office?
303	Hi.
303	I'm ready to go postal with all the computer problems I'm having.
303	Did you get the document I sent yesterday morning?
304	Greetings (or Hola!): Talked to Jeff Green.
304	He said he'd do the road, but can't do it with the wood that's in the driveway.
304	Eldon, are you and Bob planning to go up this week?
304	If so, any chance of getting the wood moved?
304	Otherwise, going to be tough to do the road.
304	Jeff starts on my road on Wednesday and I'll be going up this weekend to monitor (and start organizing some of the chopped up wood that's lying around the yard at the dome. Welcome back. Hope you had a good time in Mexico. Best, Jeff
305	My calendar shows free, but you'll have to check with ms prentice.
306	Thank you.
306	Sounds like Tues and Wed it is.
307	Hi Jeannie: My apologies.
307	I've been switched over to Windows 2000 and, well, things have been somewhat bumpy.
307	I have a few comments on the Frevert piece but can't find the document you sent.
307	Could you resend it?
307	Best, Jeff
308	Thanks very much for taking care of the case.
308	See you tonite.
309	Agreed.
309	Also, Margaret, do we have numbers on what portion of GDP and California's "GDP" the tech sector represents?
309	Best, Jeff
310	I'll check.
310	In the meantime, I'm in the SF office all week.
311	Hey Buddy: Hope your weekend was nice.
311	Tried to call, but I think your voicemail is messed up out there today.
311	Checking in to see whether Hoecker said it or not.
311	Any word?
311	Also, looks like we're on for Portland next Tuesday/Wednesday.
311	Would definitely like to gather (phone call or something) prior to the meeting so we (me, you, Rick, Richard) are clear on what our goals are for the meeting and what the agenda needs to look like.
311	Finally, I should have a draft of my "Tech Section" ready by tomorrow sometime.
311	That was our deadline, correct?
311	Any other follow-info from last Tuesday'Wednesday's meeting that I should be aware of?
311	Finally, you see Harry's note?
311	Can you make a call to discuss the PG&E strategy on Wednesday?
311	Best, Jeff
312	Appears that PG&E has joined the "refund" chorus.
313	I'd wait until, for example, Ginger and Maureen say they're happy and all the bugs have been worked out--my productivity has dropped by about 99%.
313	I'll do some minor strike-out-underline and some minor suggestions and send back by 5 pm California time.
314	Oh great, he gets married, but his kids die from pollution.
315	Worry not.
315	Hope all is well.
315	Went to the tapas place ("Cesar") next to Chez Panisse.
315	Have you been there?
315	Very nice and pretty fun, too.
315	Best, Jeff
316	Ditto: Caps, stink, but if they must be done in the short term, only do them for residential (since of course the damage that wholesale prices will inflict will grossly outweigh and alleged benefits).
316	But any caps must be accompanied by real, strucutural reforms.
316	Have a great time.
316	Please let us know how it goes.
316	(I have a sneaking suspicion they listen to you more than you let on.) Best, Jeff
317	Jeannie: Here are a few proposed edits.
317	If you need anything, just holler.
317	Best, Jeff
318	Hey, forget football, and Terrell what's-his-name and the demise of the 49ers.
318	Think road.
318	If it's going to get done 1) the wood needs to get moved and 2) we need to tell Jeff Green immediately so he can order the gravel.
318	Let me know.
318	It's the 2 minute warning and you're down by a touchdown.
318	Best, Jeff
319	On behalf of free-market loving people around the world, thank you.
319	I'll forward later this morning or early afternoon what I've pulled together (or more accurately, simply re-arranged, using the great info you forward last week).
319	Best, Jeff
320	Yes, am aware of it, but there was no attachment (re: PG&E's proposal) in the note that I received.
320	Could someone please forward?
320	Thanks.
321	Gee, with all due respect, this sounds like SoCal trying to justify its windowing policy.
321	Have you considered a career as a PR exec with OPEC.
321	Affectionately yours, Jeff
322	Hi and good morning.
322	Could you please book me a ticket for Portland.
322	Need to arrive in Portland on this coming Monday morning by 8-8:30 AM, and return to SF at around 4:30-5:00 PM on Tuesday.
322	Thanks very much.
322	Also, could you book me a hotel room at the 5th Avenue place (or whatever it's called).
323	Your honor, could the witness please explain the source of his information.
323	Couldn't be the Ford Excursion marketing department, could it?
324	Noise pollution.
324	The #1 killer in America....
325	That TOTALLY works for me.
325	Just wanted to give you an out in case you found funner people.
325	Great, it's set.
325	We're a team.
326	THAT'S a good one.
326	Have I told you how much I miss Norm?
327	it's in the driveway.
327	the big stack of planks that were stained and then stacked back in the driveway.
327	in addition, there's the other wood (stacked with the planks) for the stairs, etc.
328	very helpful.
328	thank you.
329	Attached is a first rough cut.
329	Work continues but wanted to distribute for feedback.
329	All is welcome and appreciated.
330	I was holding back a bit.
330	All I needed was the green light.
330	I'll make it explicit.
330	Thanks for the comments.
330	I am very ready to start getting the word out.
330	Best, Jeff
331	Dear Nancy: I am not resonsible for Prentice's failure to respond.
331	Please contact her at Yours truly, Jeff And by all the notes your sending (jokes, 50s cook books, etc.), I assume that you're still on vacation?
331	How was Mexico?
332	was it fun?
332	was the area nice?
332	were you in the mountains of oaxaca, or something?
333	sounds good.
333	i'll put it on my calendar.
334	got message call if you can 415.782.7822.
335	got message.
335	will stick to original plan.
335	agree w/you re: dennis.
335	page me tomorrow when you can.
335	best,jeff
336	I left you a voicemail just to say that I love you.
336	How's it going over there today?
337	Can't thank you enough for your help and for comments.
337	I'm going to continue to work on it.
337	Have another data question.
337	Can we determine big high tech's electricity bill was in California and nationally last year?
337	Thanks again.
337	Best, Jeff
338	Dude.
338	Dude.
338	I'm reaching for the saltines.
338	You want to get tickets to the Shepard play?
339	Can you define "off line?"
339	You mean they're going to "island' themselves, no longer taking power from the grid? To get the standby service, they'll need to sign an agreement under PG&E's standby tariffs (the tariff for cogens if the cogens getting the standby, or for the University, if UC's taking the standby).
340	10 AM California time.
340	He should call 415.782.7856.
341	ETI Update National PR campaign to push Enron policy agenda/commercial opportunties California Strategy Trip to Portland Analyst/Associate for SF GA?
341	Gas Update Sempra Commercial update (Calger)
342	You like to handle, or would you like me to?
343	thoughts?
344	Mike: What are your thoughts on this?
345	call 415.782.7856 at 10 AM.
346	Thank you.
347	And comments of other participants to the AB 1890 deal would also be very helpful (like Steve Peace and customer groups).
347	Ought to show why Glynn's making comments like "we don't want to overanalyze the old deal."
348	Cool.
348	This is in Baja?
348	Can we get pictures?
349	I'm assuming, since I haven't heard back, that we're going to take a pass this time on the Dome road, and perhaps have Jeff Green do it another time?
349	If I'm incorrect, we'll need to get things squared away, like today.
349	Let me know, Jeff
350	I was forced to allow my business judgment pre-empt my personal wishes....
351	Can you get in touch w/Eldon?
351	I've been unsuccessful the last two days.
351	May be too late at this point.
351	I was supposed to get in touch with Jeff beginning of the week so that he could order gravel.
351	And haven't even talked to him about the culvert.
351	If he does the culvert, Eldon's going to have to make sure that the other people on the road don't have a fit about Eldon "re-designing" the road right around the Dome (which fixing the culvert will entail).
352	FYI.
352	If you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate...
353	Can't wait for the bullets to start to fly.
353	Do we know what the total $ amount is to EES (if they were to book the entire credit to Enron)?
353	Thanks.
354	thanks for looking.
354	when you leaving?
354	congratz on being the spokesperson.
354	if you ever want to compare notes, just let me know.
355	Harry: At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it as the "base case" to start running the numbers.
355	Idea being that before we shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine whether the thing's got any legs.
355	Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case numbers shake out, we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial groups for buy-in.
355	We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look like by middle of next week.
355	How's this plan sound?
355	Few other points: We assume that bullet 6's reference to "net" means that the deferral is calculated by taking any "overcollections" and subtracting them from any "undercollections" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year.
355	What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?
355	We're assuming it's commercially driven.
355	We correct?
355	If so, what's the driver?
355	Same goes for the 2004 ending date.
355	Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an "Option 2" for folks to consider.
355	(Though we don't think that any numbers need to be run on "Option 2" until after having completed the analysis on option 1, since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct).
355	Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking treatment.
355	Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers "noncore," similar to the gas model in California, and force those customers to choose an ESP.
355	Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining "core" (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.
355	Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that I want to throw out for folks to react to: Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down and simple as possible.
355	When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation?
355	In option 2, by adding the "noncore" feature, and by implementing that feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the utility's position).
355	This is not to say that the complications can't be worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to highlight it for folks to consider.
355	Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and "Option 2."
355	Best, Jeff
356	see what we can do.
356	when you getting back.
357	My apologies.
357	I'm confused.
357	1) When are we scheduled to meet with Tim?
357	Just Tuesday afternoon, or Tues/Wed?
357	Thanks, Jeff
358	What time do you get home from school.
358	If it's before 5 could you stop by the Theater on the Square box office and get tickets?
358	Cameron said that she and Scott want tickets, too.
358	It's going to sell out (if it ain't already sold out), so we should probably do it quickly.
358	I love you.
359	Champagne.
359	P.S.
359	Though it feels like it at times, he's not my Dad.
360	Greetings Professor: Apologies for asking, but something has come up and I wanted to inquire about the chances of taking the E203 final on a day other than Sunday the 10th of December.
360	Preferably Tu, W, Th, the week of the 11th.
360	Best, Jeff
361	Thanks.
361	Best of luck.
361	Don't hesitate to call if there's anything you need.
361	Look forward to getting down to S.D.
361	soon.
361	Maybe we can talk Jessie into having a drink.
361	Best, Jeff
362	Hey there stranger: By the looks of your attire (very nice), and the pace of you walk the other night, looks like you're back in the working groove.
362	Hope work is fun and your classes are good.
362	I'm trying to get used to the "no life" thing again.
362	And you slacked on the happy hour.
362	Best, Jeff
363	Christine: My apologies.
363	My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.
363	Here's where folks came out.
363	There's some concern about size.
363	We're supposed to be no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our "oversized" group.
363	The other folks in the group--who talked to him originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.
363	Folks wondered if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up with.
363	Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we spoke.
363	If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know.
363	Fortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.
363	Best, Jeff
364	Appreciate the speedy response.
364	Actually, it's a "personal" event opposed to a business reason, and though important, I don't think it clears your hurdle.
364	No problem.
364	Never hurts to inquire, and I appreciate the consideration.
364	Best, Jeff "Jonathan Berk" Please respond to berk
365	FYI.
365	The weekend of the 9th/10th is definitely out for me.
365	I'm sorry, honey.
366	you know, i'd have to be in a store and have the opportunity to look at a bunch of styles in order to choose a pair.
367	Hi.
367	Did you hear from Sue Mara re: how the California ISO works?
368	Gang: I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t.
368	siting reform.
368	One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power as a result.
368	Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps, investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back de-regulation, to name a few.
368	Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this session is a fairly high priority?
368	I'm not sure what the answer is, but it struck me as I was pretty-ing up the document and I thought I'd put it out there for reaction.
368	Best, Jeff
369	Any of those days work EXCEPT the 22nd.
370	Thanks.
370	Please continue to include me on all the FERC related ditties.
370	Mary agree that we don't need to file separately?
371	I think this captures it.
371	I've also attached the "Posture" document Sue wrote up.
371	While Paul takes a first crack at the cover memo, please review both documents and see if there are any changes that either needs.
371	Best, Jeff
372	See my note and Christine's response.
372	Thoughts?
372	Suggestions?
372	Jimmie, apparently she's had a crush on you ever since she heard you say, "Cash-sucking machine."
373	Thanks for the note.
373	I'm going to pass it along to the others.
373	Will get back to you very soon.
373	Remember that there's no team case due on Monday because class is cancelled and everything got pushed back.
373	But the first individual case has to be done by Tuesday.
373	Best, Jeff
374	Hi Scott: Thanks for the note.
374	Hope things are well.
374	I'd like to call the El Paso person if that works for you.
374	Yep, moratorium's still in place (at least to build your own---you can always get someone who previously received authority to do it for you).
374	I'll keep you posted.
374	Best, Jeff
375	OK, I'm a mindless idiot.
375	And an embarrassed one at that.
375	To which offer are you referring?
375	Also, learned that PG&E's big "want" in the Son of Gas Accord is a few hundred million to build more Tx and Local Tx.
375	Sounds like this could have an IMMENSE negative impact on TW.
375	You better get your fanny out here, like pronto.
375	I sense death and destruction.
376	thank you
377	the offer's still good...
378	This mean we'll be toning down our criticism of the utility's behavior in the California market in our filings at FERC regarding the price spike investigation?
379	Thanks, Lee.
379	Is there a firmed-up agenda yet?
379	If so, could you forward to me?
380	Hi Anita: Thanks again for you help with the questions I had about the deals going on California.
380	I'd like to follow-up with you and Steve, particularly regarding the "not a telecom" aspect of the deal.
380	These deals are going to accelerate--very confidentially, they are directly linked to getting the universe connected to Enron On-line, our very successful B2B website.
380	I'd like to discuss with you two as soon as possible.
380	Could you let me know when a convenient time is?
380	Thanks a million.
380	Best, Jeff
381	Greetings.
381	Just checking in to see how Mitch and Carl are doing on the proposal.
382	Unless someone has concerns, I'd like to share the results of our Wednesday meeting w/Roger.
383	decided i ought to ask around first.....
384	Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up doing more work on my property. I agreed (there's a lot more bark from all the wood chopping and that'll get us through till June). I talked to him about the culvert. He had some thoughts, which I'll pass along and I'll talk to him about it some more this weekend.
385	Here it is.
385	Thanks a million for your help.
386	Roger: We're still ruminating on this within Government Affairs and will continue to ruminate over the next few days, but wanted to fill you in on where we currently are and get your comments.
386	Thanks.
386	Jeff
387	thank you.
388	please loop me in on the call w/tim.
388	thanks.
389	Yes, they will have to file with the PUC.
390	This works for my schedule.
390	I will likely attend the subpoena meeting.
391	The world is mighty small.
391	As an undergrad at Berkeley, I worked as a paralegal at Brobeck.
391	One of the "associates" I reported to was, you guessed it, Gary Fergus.
391	Haven't seen him since.
391	Will be interested to compare notes.
392	Hi: O lord.
392	You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have time to think about things and absorb it.
392	But work has gotten so insane that I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).
392	I think I've maybe made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.
392	NORTH of Sacramento.
392	Are you driving to Sacramento every day?
392	Say it ain't so.
392	That's brutal.
392	When you say full time, you mean school full time?
392	That, I assume, means leaving your job?
392	Be happy to talk about it.
392	You know me---believer in always keeping all options open and active.
392	If full time makes sense, you ought to do it.
392	Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday because I have to be in Portland.
392	If you're not going to Sac on Monday, coffee in SF during work hours works.
392	Or I could meet you during break on Monday.
392	Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday when I'm back from Portland.
392	Hang in there.
392	I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground again.
392	Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.
392	Let me know what works for you.
392	Best, Jeff PS I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case.
392	Hope that's modest consolation.
392	"Strategizing?!"
392	(I don't think so.)
393	Thanks.
393	That certainly puts things in perspective.
394	Ditto.
394	I vote that we suggest to Christine that 5's too darned unwieldy and that she look for another, smaller group.
394	And if she's unable to find one then we can talk.
395	Simon did a nice job on the presentation, but I need some things re-arranged, added, etc. Should I call him directly, other?
395	Let me know.
395	Thanks a million.
395	Best, Jeff
396	Plz call.
396	Any numbers yet?
396	Skilling talking to Gov today?
396	415.782.7822.
397	Wow.
397	Don't worry about it.
397	Have a great time in Montana.
397	It will be gorgeous up there.
397	You're camped out in Roseville?
397	You don't deserve that, Courtney.
397	Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.
397	When you get back, give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or something.
397	Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea and the right thing to do.
397	Don't stress too much.
397	Good luck and can't wait to hear about Big Sky.
397	Best, Jeff
398	Monday--In office Thursday--In office Friday--Vacation day possibly
399	will do.
399	Thanks.
400	Here's the edited version (word document format).
400	If you have any questions, just give me a ring at 415.782.7822.
400	Thanks very much for your help.
400	Best, Jeff
401	Ok, cut the shakespeare.
401	What's your vote?
401	She wrote again in inquiring.
402	Hi Christine: Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.
402	Here's where folks came out.
402	First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.
402	Second, it's a real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will break the camel's back.
402	Suggestion came up that it might be much more mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.
402	If there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and hope the ship don't sink?
402	Sound reasonable?
402	Best, Jeff
403	That clears it up.
403	Thanks very much for the prompt response.
404	I have to go to Portland tomorrow, coming back Wednesday afternoon.
404	I'd like to see you tonite before I leave if you're available.
405	Thanks.
405	I should be there about 7.
405	You know that I love you very much, Prentice.
406	OK gang, she's hell bent, and I've spent about as much time as I'm willing on this.
406	Sorry about the hassle---Jimmie, if you hadn't used that colorful language, we wouldn't be in this mess.
406	Anyway, unless I hear strong protests in the next 30 minutes, I'm writing back to say she can join (and has to do the next case all by her lonesome on the team's behalf as payback).
406	Lemme know.
406	Best, Jeff
407	Have messages in to him.
408	What do you think?
408	Me or you get to have all the funny with Johnnie
409	Steve.
409	FYI.
409	Got bounced back the first time.
410	are you serious?
411	Well, if you're going to want someone from Enron, it's going to have to be me.
411	Let me know if you're still interested.
411	"Delaney Hunter" Please respond to dhunter
412	See below.
412	"Delaney Hunter" Please respond to dhunter
413	you win the big prize!
414	It's simple.
414	Purchase.......I mean Pool.......well, purchase can be better sometimes.
415	Mike Kahn: 415.986.2800.
415	ext.
415	205.
415	Let me know how it goes.
415	Best, Jeff P.S.
415	And I mean this in all seriousness.....
415	Many months ago, you were sitting in our small conference room and said, "The Governor needs to take control and initiate a negotiation, or summit."
415	Looks like he finally figured it out.
416	The original proposed messages I distributed for the high tech sector have been put into a power point presentation and include comments received.
416	Many thanks to Margaret Carson, who did much of the heavy lifting.
416	Additional comments are welcome and suggestions on how to spice up the korny title slide are greatly appreciated.
416	Best, Jeff
417	Got bounced back the first time.
418	This got bounced back, too.
419	We're on at 9:30 AM California time.
419	I'll call you early in the AM to confirm, coordinate, ruminate, etc. Best, Jeff
420	Christine: Sorry I haven't replied sooner.
420	Crazy day.
420	Consider yourself the 5th member of our team---but remember, no warranties included.
420	Best, Jeff
421	There you go again, always demanding substance.
421	I'll fill you in tomorrow on why it's so high level (and repetitive).
421	Believe it or not, Larry Ellison (CEO Oracle) and Scott McNealy (CEO Sun) is the audience--neither's real up to speed on the industry.
421	PS How's the cover memo for the strategy coming?
421	Best, Jeff
422	The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.
422	He's intrigued about the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.
422	Governor and his folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be another call next Monday.
422	Will fill you in as things progress.
422	Thanks again for the pricing sheet.
422	Please keep all of this highly confidential.
422	Best, Jeff
423	As my mother likes to say, "You should be on the stage.... the one that left an hour ago."
424	I was worried about this.
424	Sent it Monday night.
424	Kept getting bounced back.
424	Could you page me at 888.916.7184 and let me know that you get it?
424	I'm in Portland.
424	Also, got Ginger's message re: paragraph on TW deal.
424	Steffes said you didnt' need right away because EBR got cancelled.
424	When do you need and do you want just background, or valuation calculations, too?
424	Thanks.
424	Best, Jeff
425	Will do.
426	I like the idea.
426	Particularly in view of the "California Crisis."
426	Makes our positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the "solution" for California.
427	Attached are the high tech slides with the correct figure for dollars that the high tech sector spent on electricity in 1999.
428	I'm sure that you'll have a great time arguing our case before the court.
428	If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.
428	P.S.
428	How's things?
429	Our meetings will be much more effective you attend.
429	We should try to talk tomorrow or Friday.
430	Good questions for which I don't currently have answers.
431	If it's truly the real thing.
431	I'll take two cases.
431	Thanks for asking.
432	Thanks, Sarah.
432	Question: Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC releases the results of its investigation?
433	real meaning real acacia.
433	don't care about labeling.
433	what would you compare to in quality?
433	seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non?
433	what cheese?
433	man, you saw a great game.
433	i was portland for the past couple days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).
433	GO GIANTS!
434	Tim: I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.
434	So I'd rather keep our powder dry and use Skilling at another time.
434	Not top-shelf enough in my view.
434	If you want to discuss further let me know.
434	Also, one question: Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?
434	I have that right?
435	If you have any questions, don't hesitate.
436	Hey, no problem.
436	I'll call Badeer.
437	Steve: Let me know if you'd like to discuss.
437	I like Tim's idea re: maybe you should take the slot.
437	But in my view definitely not Skilling.
437	I think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with Schroeder re: Littlechild.
437	Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).
437	I had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis.
437	I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am surprised to see it turn up in print.
437	Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.
437	In fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one but that we're always interested in working together.
437	Best, Jeff
438	Between you and me, I don't think California is an option at this point.
439	Mr. DeMille would like to know if you're ready for your close-up.
440	Couple of thoughts: In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to a pounding they're taking from Wall Street).
440	This will likely increase the pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t.
440	finding a way out of the IOU undercollection problem.
440	The increased pressure to act in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.
440	Regarding the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having the adminstration cook up something less preferable.
441	I doubt that anyone in accounting has it, and I'm not sure to whom in accounting to send it.
441	Suggestions?
441	I think that Bowen & Co. could likely help us out on this first filing.
441	Also, Sue, regarding NY: I have a call into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.
441	Haven't heard back yet.
442	FYI.
442	Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in California.
442	Been trading messages.
442	When she gets back to me with what she wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.
442	Question: What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the intent of getting her to do a story on it?
442	She might be a good "carrier."
442	Thoughts?
442	One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.
442	Best, Jeff
443	Here's the next version of the slides.
443	Few points: There are a few holes (pre-quals and process in particular)--my brain began to fail.
443	But I think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily finalize by tomorrow.
443	I didn't have an electronic version of Whaley's slides, so I couldn't integrate them.
443	But I don't think it will take much to do the integration.
443	Some of Whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity.
443	We still have some wordsmithing to do re: participate, run the auction, or participate and run the auction.
443	Best, Jeff
444	Thanks.
444	I love you, too.
444	Seriously, appreciate the feedback.
444	I was working from a great first cut.
445	no classes.
445	just lots of studying.
446	Agree completely.
446	Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, etc. Just a thought.
446	Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the quick action/message we're looking for.
447	Anyone out there know why FERC has asked the PX for still more data?
448	Richard: Looks good.
448	One comment: Under the section "Generating Documents: Requests 12, 14 and 18," I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph starting with "For Portland General..."
448	and not the "alternate ending."
448	To further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of increased wholesale purchases.
448	Paul Kaufman would have details of the request.
448	Hope your son's doing well.
448	Best, Jeff
449	I can be on the call.
450	Mitch: Paul Kaufman mentioned that you'd like to see the testimony that Steve Kean (at a congressional field hearing in San Diego) and I (at a FERC field hearing in San Diego) gave a few weeks ago.
450	Steve had prepared remarks.
450	They are attached.
450	I did not have prepared remarks, but I've attached my talking points.
450	My talking points were not made public, however, so please keep them private.
450	Finally, I'm trying to get a transcript of the FERC hearing.
450	If you would like a copy, please let me know.
450	And if there's anything else that I can do, please don't hestitate to contact me.
450	Best, Jeff
451	BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on the basis of bids and offers.
451	The problem is that the plants the ISO ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.
451	Everyone, including Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent.
452	Yes, will be on call.
453	I apologize for being tardy.
453	I can have my IRS to you by Monday.
454	Hi Delaney: I won't need a room.
454	Did you want me to participate on a panel?
454	If so, which day and at what time?
454	Who else will be on the panel?
454	Inquiring minds would love to know.
454	Best, Jeff "Delaney Hunter" Please respond to dhunter
455	Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW).
455	I met her as part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case.
455	For some time she's been inquiring about Government Affairs.
455	She called me yesterday and mentioned that she's very interested in exploring if there are any opportunities in GA.
455	From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very professional and I think TW would say the same.
455	She likes her work but wants a new challenge.
455	I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be interested in talking with her.
455	I think that it would be useful for you to chat with her.
455	Thoughts?
455	Susan would like to keep it confidential at this point.
456	I don't think that the stranded cost issue has been squarely addressed.
457	Has Sue gotten in touch with you.
457	And have you contacted Tim Belden in Portland?
457	He is the absolute guru on this stuff.
458	Lee: I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling, but I'll get back to you soon.
458	Also, I want to manage expectations a bit about the possibility of having Enron stream the conference.
458	Just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.
458	I'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at this juncture.
458	Thanks a bunch.
458	Best, Jeff
459	Couple of brief comments: 1) There is a new and growing drum beat to reduce California's wholesale price caps further (i.e., below $250, with some suggesting $100).
459	We need to discuss strategy very soon.
459	2) I'm attempting to arrange a meeting between ENA (Calger) and Sempra (CFO) to discuss commercial opportunities.
460	FYI.
460	Great news.
460	PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.
460	So we're good to go on filing our final tariff.
460	It's attached.
460	Please take a look and let's discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.
460	Best, Jeff
461	It was covered extensively in today's LA Times.
462	Will do.
463	Chris: Here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated.
463	Take a look.
463	Also, feel free to integrate the portions that you're working on ("deal bench," pre-quals, etc.) directly into the presentation, or I'd be happy to do it.
463	I'm at 415.782.7822.
463	I'm contacting Benevides about putting an illustrative slide together representing the base and peak blocks.
463	Best, Jeff
464	Prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite?
464	What time is dinner by the way.
464	I'm supposed to do something from 3-4, but could come up directly thereafter.
465	Rebecca Smith called.
465	She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM California.
465	Topics: 1) How California got here.
465	2) How California can get out of it.
465	Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?
465	I think I've got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.
465	Let me know.
465	Hear's a message I'm practicing: "Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."
465	Best, Jeff
466	Here's the article that I referred to.
466	Could you please email or fax to me the Commission's decision denying Edison's emergency motion?
466	Greatly appreciated.
466	Best, Al Gore
467	yes.
468	Well, wouldn't you know it.
468	I couldn't find the most recent version in my email.
468	But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.
468	Couple of other points: I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an attachment.
468	I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."
468	Think it's something we need to focus on.
468	Have a great weekend.
468	Spreadsheet to follow.
469	I confess that I haven't even looked at the bloody thing.
469	How many questions?
469	Should we divide them up and pass around as usual?
470	Heres' the spreadsheet.
470	I added "regulatory intelligence and expertise" right after the top 5.
470	Check it out.
470	Best, Jeff
471	Understanding there won't be a call on Monday, here's a draft of the auction slides that we've been working on for folks to review.
472	I'm slow, but I catch on eventually.
472	Steffes was fired up when he called.
472	Sounds like the meeting went pretty well.
472	Have a good weekend.
472	Best, Jeff
473	Haven't heard of them.
473	And I'm not aware of any new tariffs that offer those kinds of savings, but we'll check around.
474	Hello?
474	I guess everyone's wrapped up in the baseball playoffs and the debates.
474	There are 4 questions.
474	Since the SF people did 1&2 last time and the East Bay contingent did 3&4, seems we can switch this time.
474	SF takes 3&4; East Bay 1&2.
474	Best, Jeff
475	Greetings.
475	I'm going to read the material and the case today.
475	Should we compare notes (via email) on questions 3&4 by tomorrow (Sunday) before lunch?
475	Let me know.
475	Best, Jeff
476	You're the man.
476	Thanks.
476	I'll coordinate with Kim and the new recruit.
477	I'll get you for this.
478	Here's a very rough shot at #'s 3&4.
478	I think 4's worded very strangely (thus my strange answer).
478	Anyway, thought I'd throw something together to get the ball rolling.
478	I'll keep thinking about and send another dispatch later today or first thing tomorrow morning.
478	Best, Jeff
479	Looks good, Kim.
479	Thanks.
480	Agreed.
480	I'll handle it.
480	Best, Jeff
481	Looks good.
481	Thanks.
481	See you tomorrow.
481	Best, Jeff
482	Greetings: How's things?
482	Got your message.
482	Best place to get your hands on the report is the CalPX website.
482	If you have any problems, let me know.
482	I'll try to write a note discussing our conversation on Friday by end of day.
482	Best, Jeff
483	Seems that we could provide Lay/Skilling with the power point slides as prep for any calls.
483	As a starter, it would be useful to provide McNeally with a letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers.
483	Best, Jeff
484	Greetings: Any word about whether the PUC bought our proposal?
484	Best, Jeff
485	Strange.
485	I think that I received an email from someone with the report attached.
485	Let me scour my emails.
485	If and when I find it, I'll forward.
485	Disheartening that you can't find a document that's getting so much press.
485	Great website...
486	Please let me know if you want me to participate in any gas panels.
486	And my feelings won't be hurt if you say no.
486	Worry not.
486	Just need to know so that I can prepare some materials.
486	Best, Jeff
487	Here's one that's "final," not draft, that just came out.
487	I'm assuming that this is the one the press is refering to.
487	Let me know that you think.
488	Gee, I don't know what came over me.
488	Apologies.
489	Just spent about 90 minutes with Rebecca.
489	She left with a very good understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.
489	She also spent time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request for a big check to cover the undercollections.
489	She expects to have a "big picture" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & future--completed in the next couple of weeks.
489	In Rebecca's words, she wants the story to "shake things up."
489	She's very upset with how the utilities are handling it.
489	I told her we were less concerned with "he said/she said" and more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair to everyone.
489	Mark and Karen: In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been understood that our conversations are off the record and background.
489	Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of my more colorful quotes.
489	It was no different this time.
489	If anyone wants more details, just let me know.
489	Best, Jeff
490	Jimmie's the "compiler" this time.
490	You're stuff was good.
490	Whether he has time to incorporate remains to be seen.
490	But I wouldn't sweat it.
490	We can talk more tonite about our somewhat "loose" but thus far effective means for getting these things done every week.
490	Best, Jeff
491	Here you go.
491	Who's Ugoretz?
491	Happy Yom.
491	Best, Jeff
492	Here's Paul's memo with Mona's edits and a couple of my edits.
492	It's been shipped off to Paul.
492	I assume he'll be sending it out tomorrow.
492	If there's any more questions, edits, comments, etc., please give Paul a buzz.
492	Best, Jeff
493	In the office all week.
494	got it.
495	They've asked me to be on a gas panel.
495	I've said yes, but hadn't planned at this point on attending any of the conference other than the panel.
496	Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.
496	He'll call back if there's a problem.
496	Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other filings.
496	Best, Jeff
497	NARUC's meeting at ground-zero dereg (San Diego) in mid-November, right after the elections.
497	Might be a good opportunity for a PR event.
498	I can't place him either.
499	FYI.
499	Here's what Dave pulled together on Friday.
499	I talked to him and told him I was going to make a single power point out of the info and then run it by him for review and comment.
500	Shoot.
500	Love to, but I have a final on Sunday--yes Sunday--the 10th.
500	Hey, thanks for hanging up on me on Friday.
501	Ms Bennett: Thanks for the voicemail.
501	Couldn't locate the files you sent in August (uemail now deletes automatically, which may be the problem).
501	Could you forward a copy to Mr Yang?
501	Most appreciated.
501	Best, Jeff
502	I've got my car today.
502	If you need a ride---there, back, or both--just let me know.
503	Check it out.
504	Figures.
504	I'll see if I can find that needle in that haystack and get back to you.
505	Hi: I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.
505	Haven't seen you for a while.
505	Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.
505	This is the first travel-free week I've had in a long time.
505	You want to try to have lunch?
505	Or we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you like.
505	Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day student.
505	Did you manage to get away last Thursday?
505	Best, Jeff
506	Harry: FYI.
506	First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by AB 970 is 10.7.
506	Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).
506	Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.
506	URL for the event is included below.
506	Best, Jeff
507	Mike: We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case.
507	We'd originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus for coming in under the cap.
507	You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according to my records) for over $25,000.
507	As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs.
507	I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.
507	With that in mind, I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.
507	However, in light of the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.
507	If you'd like to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.
507	Let me know.
507	Best, Jeff
508	Off what hook?
509	Seems like information that we'd want to get our hands on, non?
510	aye aye
511	Thanks, Mike.
511	I prefer the $15,000/clean slate option.
511	For comments on the proposed decision and lobbying on this specific case, I'm willing to go straight hourly basis, but I will continue to request fixed prices going foward.
511	And worry not, it's not a Rick, Paul, Steffes issue.
511	I'm the headache.
511	All this said, and budget haggling aside, I'm sure you're aware that it's my view that 1) you do fantastic work and 2) it's great to work with you.
511	Best, Jeff
512	EBS Update Gov Davis/Skilling Update Meeting w/Sempra Coffee with Rebecca Smith QF support for ENA Miscellaneous
513	Are folks available for a call tomorrow at 9 AM to begin preparing for the meeting with Sempra next week?
514	Based on last nite's discussion, here's the coordinator list: Kim--11.1--Agro Feed Jeff--11.27--Global Industries We also decided that: 1) we'd continue with the SF/East Bay split 2) each group should combine the answers into one document prior to sending to the coordinator for final compilation 3) we'd distribute draft answers to the entire group, since some questions feed off of others 4) we'd get finalized responses to the coordinator no later than 4 PM on Sunday Let me know if this tracks with others' memories.
514	Best, Jeff
515	SF
516	Given that Peace is likely going to try to push legislation to merge the ISO and PX and other nasty things, likely makes sense to listen in on our message development, tactics in addressing the LMP problem.
516	You think there'd be any problem with that?
516	If not, could you pass along the call in number?
516	Thanks, Jeff
517	love one.
517	thanks.
518	good job.
519	Thanks, I'll set up a call.
520	thanks.
520	i'll set up the call.
521	where are you?
521	my phone's been on since you paged me.
521	i didn't get any tickets.
521	i love you oodles.
521	(you slobbery ol' sniffly day student doggie.)
522	Thank you, Marcia.
523	Hi.
523	Please set up a call for 60 minutes for tomorrow, 10.11.00 for 11 AM CALIFORNIA time and distribute info to the list of folks below.
523	Thank you very much.
524	Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.
524	Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.
524	But before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles call for a wee bit of polling.
524	Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses pronto.
524	If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.
524	Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.
524	Here are the questions: Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?
524	Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear from other folks.
524	If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.
524	Same goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat).
524	Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.
524	Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES and ENA) or confine it to GA?
524	Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA?
524	We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.
524	What's your preference.
524	Is there a day that just won't work?
524	Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.
524	Best, Jeff
525	test
526	Please send responses to both me and Joseph.
526	Thank you.
527	Attached is a "plant siting" slide for the next Skilling/Davis meeting.
527	I developed it from background materials that Dave Parquet pulled together.
527	This version includes Daves' comments.
527	His comments are in CAPS.
527	Best, Jeff
528	Now I understand why you were talking to Rubin and Summers.
528	Sounds like an outstanding hire.
528	Congratulations.
528	Exciting changes for exciting times.
529	Congratulations one and all.
529	Very exciting, and well deserved to boot.
529	Look forward to working with you in your new roles.
529	Best, Jeff
530	As a follow-up to our call.
530	Here is some additional information regarding QF pricing issues.
530	QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched. The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices will force the QFs that have switched to "refund" some of the payments they've received (e.g., under a "PX minus" mechanism). The majority of QFs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit). As we discussed, the Commission strongly rejected Edison's emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the QF pricing formula. Recall also that a couple of months ago
531	I accidentally sent it before it was complete.
531	Full note to follow.
532	OK, given the Enron Xmas party in Houston, and Sue's request that weekends be included in the ballot, please repond to the dates listed below.
532	Please give 1) your top 3 preferences, and 2) any days for which you have a (true) conflict.
532	Thanks.
532	Also, unless I hear otherwise, we'll assume that partners and children come included.
532	Thanks.
532	Best, Jeff Nov. 30, Dec. 1, Dec. 2
533	Bill Reed Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Officer" will replace Gary Cotton on the ISO Board.
534	Wednesday, Dec. 13th would work best for me.
535	FYI.
535	Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.
535	ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets.
535	In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers).
535	ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate).
535	We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.
535	Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer.
535	For electricity, the plan has two pieces: 1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).
535	Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.
535	We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.
535	Best, Jeff
536	Hey Tim: Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas outsource deal.
536	We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next Thursday.
536	On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there.
536	Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for Skilling).
536	If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just give a holler, or check in with Chris.
536	Best, Jeff
537	Steve: Here's a word version of the MSA.
537	Sorry for the delay.
537	Could you make changes in strike-out-underline format and email back to me when you're done?
537	Thanks a million.
537	Best, Jeff
538	Could be me, but that doesn't look like your email address.
538	You get this email from Jeremy (good guy who works with Steve)?
539	Just following up to make sure that accounting knows that ETI's quarterly fee statement needs to be turned in by the 15th.
539	Best, Jeff
540	Vail???
540	Flagstaff???
540	Man, I'm in the wrong business.
540	Now listen Stumpy, if you think you're going to Vail so some half-#%$#ed customer can run over your OTHER knee with a snow mobile, right before your wedding, well think again, buster.
540	I'll see if we can set up a meeting on Thursday the 2nd.
540	Signed, Stuck in Lodi Again
541	Roger.
541	Mums the word on the gov.
542	Jim: You available to talk at 9:30 Houston time re: how to stop the next attempt at the ISO board to lower the price caps further?
542	If not, are you available at about 3 PM houston time to discuss same?
542	Thanks.
543	Hi.
543	Hope the ride back to Sacramento went OK last nite.
543	It was nice to see you and catch up.
543	I'm sorry things are so crazy, but in spite of it all, your attitude's pretty good.
543	And your new suede jacket is gorgeous.
543	I know your life is very complicated and I don't want to make it worse, but if you ever have the time and inclination to go to lunch, dinner, movie, whatever, I'd definitely be up for it.
543	Hang in there.
543	Hope to catch up again soon.
543	Best, Jeff
544	I can help, but what's your timing?
545	FYI.
546	Good points.
546	Paul's traveling.
546	I think it would be a good idea to re-group on the QF issues in California because the terrain has changed considerably in CA.
546	Best, Jeff
547	plz call re: contact w/pg&e 415.782.7822
548	hmm.
548	that makes it tougher.
548	it's crisis central today.
548	for quick answers try the ISO website (caiso.com).
548	i think you can find all that you need.
548	if not get back to me.
549	great.
550	No worries.
550	I'm not going anywhere.
550	Focus on you.
550	If you're body's reacting poorly, swift action is warranted.
550	If there's anything I can do to help, don't hesitate.
550	Hang in there.
550	Best, Jeff
551	thanks.
551	i'll be here.
552	FYI.
552	Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.
552	Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the "misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.
552	Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.
552	Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be: "The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."
552	No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.
552	Two immediate thoughts: Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
552	David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).
552	Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.
552	He also set up the Governing Boards.
553	I love you, sweetie.
553	You didn't run out of gas did you?
554	I don't know.
554	did you get the "I love you" email that I sent today?
555	DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate Freeze For Now >PCG Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to lift California's state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition to a deregulated market, saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile power prices, senior company officials said Wednesday.
555	"We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. But that view might change in the future," said a senior company official, who requested anonymity.
555	PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday to discuss plans for repairing a "not workably competitive power market" and several steps the utility plans to file with federal regulators to do that.
555	One proposal that is expected to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price for power would be predetermined based on generation costs.
555	The company wants to temporarily put an end to market-based rates.
555	The utility will also request that California's independent system operator reduce the wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from Company officials said those steps would allow them to recover billions of dollars in unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power prices and protect retail customers.
555	PG&E said generators would still be able to make a profit on power sold in California with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the state's power supply would be in jeopardy from such an action.

556	Sorry, copied distribution list off of Maureen's note from Friday saying no call with the governor and assumed that you two were on it.
557	cool.
557	sorry i couldn't be of more help.
557	it's meltdown in the land of fruits and nuts.
558	FYI.
558	CPUC accept our deal on information related to the subpoena?
558	Best, Jeff
559	Chris: Sorry for the bother, but edo you have a an electronic version of the Whaley slides?
559	If so could you email them to me.
559	Or, if you have hard copy, could you fax to me at 415.782.7854?
559	Thanks very much.
560	Good start.
560	Could you drop them into power point and forward along.
560	I'll try to add them to what I'm doing.
560	Thanks.
561	where are you?
561	415.782.7822.
562	call in at 415.782.7822.
563	It's literally next door to Woodward.
564	nope.
565	Hi Kim: Any luck withJackie re: getting together to start the project?
565	And if there's anything else I can do re: your meeting on Monday, don't hesitate.
565	Leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes.
565	I'll be in Vancouver with the EBS gang Monday/Tuesday, and if all goes well maybe I can chat up some folks while I'm there.
565	Best, Jeff
566	Thanks.
566	I agree with the recommendation.
567	Thanks for the info.
567	That guy was truly out of control at the S.D.
567	hearings.
567	Glad to hear that his rotten bills aren't going anywhere.
567	Who's gonna win the election?
567	Hope you and your ankle are doing well.
567	Best, Jeff
568	Greetings: Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed getting together the weekend before for a study session.
568	I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.
568	Sorry to those who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be interested.
568	Anyway, anyone interested?
568	Hope all is well with all.
568	Best, Jeff
569	Great idea.
570	My understanding is that the cap is $2500, but that the PX has filed with FERC to change it ot $350.
570	My understanding is that FERC has not acted on the request to change it to $350, but I could be wrong.
570	Dave, Mary, is this your understanding?
571	I think it would be a good idea to have Ron Carroll in Watkiss' shop to do a parallel analysis to what we're going to have Mike Day do.
571	Ron's very good and has done much work on these sortrs of issues.
571	You comfortable with that?
572	My pleasure.
572	By the way, we're not talking after what the NY baseball teams did to the poor Bay Area teams.
572	Best, Jeff
573	I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.
573	But I just talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could do this absent legislation.
573	He's going to do the analysis.
573	Likely better to let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, we can make that decision at that time.
573	One last thought: If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.
573	That way, he and his people are in charge.
573	But it may be difficult (impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout to get them to back off.
574	I've been asked for a copy of the transcript from the FERC hearing in S.D.
574	Any chance of getting that?
574	And do you folks have a copy of the Peace letter (treatise) sent to FERC last week?
574	If so, could you fax it to 415.782.7854?
574	Many thanks.
574	Best, Jeff
575	Thanks, Mary.
575	Did the PUC accept our deal re: information from the subpoena?
576	Monday/Tuesday--Vancouver, BC for EBS meeting Wed--In office Thurs--In office Friday--In office
577	Steve: I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.
577	May be useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of procurement.
577	Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.
577	I'm also going to give you the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for prices at SP15.
577	Best, Jeff
578	You're in. Yes, I was thinking of offering up my office.
578	Also, what do you think about getting together real soon to start setting up the model for our finance paper?
578	We'll have to do the research, but I think setting the model up will be about 75% of the project.
578	Best, Jeff
579	Some documents that Bowen & Co. did on CLEC v. IXC that may still be pertinent.
580	i love you sweetie.
580	you know it, too.
580	it's that butterfly place we don't like cuz it's right next door.
581	Here are the very indicative prices Tim gave us for 5 year deals at SP15.
581	They'll likely change by the time we meet with Sempra on Thursday.
581	25 MW, on peak (6X16): $53/MWh 25 MW, base load (7X24): $45/MWh 500 MW, on peak (6X16): $55/MWh 500 MW, base load (7X24): $47/MWh
582	My pleasure.
583	Beautiful.
583	Tuesday it is.
583	Have a great weekend.
584	Thank you.
584	Looks like the gov's office would benefit from charm school.
585	FYI.
586	thanks, jeremy.
586	my understanding is that it was sent in today.
586	i'm supposed to get a copy.
586	when i do, i'll forward along to you.
587	Got bounced back first time.

588	Little spades is in order me thinks.
588	You?
589	They're still in the formative stage, and the title is korny, but wanted to get the ball rolling.

591	have a great weekend.
591	Best, Jeff
592	drop prentice's car off at shop; go to dome
593	Attached for your review is a rough cut at slides we're preparing for the meeting with Sempra next Thursday.
593	Thoughts and comments are appreciated.
593	Please disregard korny title.
594	Thanks.
594	Didn't get it the first time.
594	Good comments.
594	I'm actually in Vancouver today (Monday) and tomorrow.
594	Let's keep sending back and forth and get together Wednesday morning to finalize.
594	I'll get a hold of Calger for his comments.
594	You can leave messages on my voicemail, too.
594	Best, Jeff
595	Will do.
595	Thanks.
596	Good morning professor: Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and can't attend class tonite.
596	I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take home midterm in this evening's class.
596	Also, could you resend the access code for the Craftmade case?
596	I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.
596	Thank you very much.
596	Best, Jeff
597	OK, lots of folks are interested.
597	Given that section is on Saturday, I propose 10 AM, this Sunday, at my office (101 California, Suite 1950).
597	If folks have a real problem with that, let me know.
597	Also, please RSVP so that I can arrange things with building security.
597	Best, Jeff
598	Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.
598	It was fun.
598	And don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.
598	Likely means that I'll be studying in Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be present for the evenings.
598	H0pe that works.
598	Kisses, Jeff PS I'm trying, lord knows I'm trying, to stay out of it, but it's going to start raining up at the Dome very, very soon.......
599	Thank you.
600	In case word hasn't gotten around, ENA learned COB Friday, that it has been chosen to engage in further negotiations with the ISO for about 450 MWs of projects.
600	The preliminary award is based on ENA's response to the RFQ that the ISO issued last month for "emergency resources."
601	Thanks for the info.
601	Congratz on the deal.
602	FYI.
603	You bet.
604	Yes, I was in Vancouver from last Sunday evening through late yesterday afternoon.
604	Thank you for checking.
605	Sure makes sense.
605	One concern.
605	If they buy up to 80% of load, do we run the risk of "stranded cost" problem later down the road when we hit the backwardated part of the curve.
605	Hinges on the term of the contract.
605	Sort of chicken and egg problem.
605	If the buy for short terms, the prices will be high, if they buy for longer terms, the prices will be lower, but the risk of stranded cost rises.
605	Thoughts?
606	I'm sorry.
606	Things are so busy that I grabbed an old list that I thought everyone was on.
606	You are most welcome indeed.
606	My office (101 Cal, Suite 1950, from 10 am to noon).
606	Best, Jeff
607	Prentice get in touch?
607	We're coming on Saturday---i'll likely bet there around 4 or 5.
607	I'll bring the money then.
607	In the meantime, can I order a case of coast zin and one of cab for pick up and payment this weekend, too?
607	Your ol' boozer Jeff
608	macaroni and cheese will be fine.
609	Thanks.
609	do i need to do anything with the form?
610	You're a star.
610	Thanks.
611	oops.
611	sunday.
612	thanks a bunch.
612	just got it.
612	really appreciate it.
612	yes, thinking about going on saturday.
612	and we s.f.
612	folks are getting together for (yet another) review on Sunday from 10 am to noon at my office.
612	you're welcome to come.
613	Well, you don't have voice mail yet I see.
613	Could you give me a call when you get a minute (I know that will be tough for the next couple of days) regarding Margo's voice mail to me.
613	I'd like to talk about one other item as well.
613	Thanks a bunch.
614	Great.
614	Thanks Seabron.
615	Knew you'd be dying to know that Barry Staw will be teaching a class on "Creativity" in the Spring.
615	Be sure to reserve your place today!
615	Best, Jeff
616	I just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know, show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes....
616	That is a great solution!
616	You mean work part time, or go to school part time.
616	Very selfishly, I'm of course very glad that you're staying in the evening program.
616	We're actually getting together on Sunday (I hope I didn't mess things up).
616	Yes, it's for finance, though you're welcome to join---we can use all the help that we can get.
616	I'm really glad to hear that things are going better.
616	You seemed in pretty good spirits on Tuesday, though I guess that could have partially been due to the big celebration over getting your first ticket.
616	Congratulations!
616	I'll buy you a beer.
616	I have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many.
616	Best, Jeff
617	Dadburnit!
617	You're not going to believe this.
617	I'm going to be in---you
618	Oh shit.
618	we forgot to get our picks in. if you page me between 10:45 and 1 PM i can call you and we can figure them out.
619	First apologies if you're getting this and you ain't even in finance---it's a study list from last year.
619	If it's annoying the heck out of you.
619	Write back and I'll try to modify the list.
619	Second, please forward to those you know I've missed.
619	Just to clarify.
619	Meet at my office on Sunday from 10 am to Noon.
619	Please bring specific questions.
619	We'll go round the room and let folks ask questions and the group will attempt to answer them.
619	Best Jeff
620	Excellent.
620	We've been wondering why we've been excluded from the bob-zinemailing list.
620	Bob: Nothing personal but I hope both NY teams lose in the world series.

621	Hope all is well.
622	Hi Mary: When Seab completes the draft of his reader-friendly exec summary, could you make sure that Karen gets a copy to review?
622	Thanks a million.
622	Best, Jeff
623	good idea.
623	epsa, too?
624	Ok.
624	Here it is.
624	Quick and dirty.
624	Make any changes you like.
624	You're right, if anyone's going to beat St. Louis, it's going to be KC, but I took St. Louis.
625	like, are you back?
626	Greetings Folks: Any chance of finalizing the California tariff Monday morning (have a call, say, 7:30/8:00 AM PDT)?
626	Let me know.
626	Hope all's well with all.
626	Best, Jeff
627	Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?
628	I have the distinct impression that you're glad this has been finalized....
629	Thanks.
629	Remind me to tell you the story of the time that I was on a panel with him.
629	Yours is the most succint description of him that I've heard to date.
629	Was curious whether his rant was getting any traction with people that matter.
629	Sounds like it isn't.
630	yes.
630	be happy to talk tomorrow.
630	just give a holler when you've a minute.
630	thanks.
631	welcome to the assylum, sue and mona.
632	Thanks for taking care of it.
632	Love to room together.
632	See you Sunday.
633	Lara: I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a deal with them).
633	That's a date that I can't change.
633	I can meet on Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 7-9.
633	Hope it's possible to re-arrange Best, Jeff
634	Thanks, Mark.
634	Sounds good.
634	As it turns out, there is a very slight chance that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.
634	I'll take you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here.
634	Best, Jeff
635	Unfortunately, I have to get on a plane and go to LA around that time.
635	If it works better, we can discuss on Tueday morning/early afternoon.
635	Just let me know.
635	Best, Jeff
636	Thanks so much for the gifts.
636	Very sweet.
636	Sorry I was rushed, but I've got a big bad finance midterm on Tuesday that I ain't ready for and work's nuts.
636	But I really want to hear more about the trip.
636	Sounds like it was a blast.
636	You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you look lovely in your everyday sweatshirt and jeans, too.
636	(Don't sweat it.) Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite.
636	You guys going?
636	Also, I'd love to talk to you this weekend if possible about Prentice's bday festivities.
637	plz call asap when you get a break re: FERC order yesterday on California.
638	plz call at 415.782.7822.
639	Good idea.
639	Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D.
639	with Sempra execs.
639	My apologies.
639	But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference would be to participate in the "first" meeting.
640	actually, i know it's from 10-2, but i don't know where.
641	You're a gem.
641	Thanks.
642	thanks a million.
643	Glad to see that you made it back to Portland.
643	Sorry about the mess.
644	FYI.
644	One of our potential competitors.
644	The VP of biz dev at perfect.com is a very good friend of mine.
644	Please forward to anyone I may have inadvertently missed.
644	Best, Jeff
645	You can count me in for $20.
646	You by chance know where the review is tomorrow?
646	It's from 10 am to 2 pm, right?
646	Thanks a bunch.
647	Thanks.
647	See you tomorrow.
648	Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.
648	The description of the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in. $100 cap for "old" generation; "new" generation would be exempt.
648	FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of their power.
648	For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100 cap, and the $250 cap will apply.
648	Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward market.
648	Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market will be penalized (details to be "ironed" out).
648	The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today.
649	No sweat.
649	Not a problem.
649	Summary will do fine.
649	Let's definitely try to coordinate for the next meeting.
649	You have a great weekend, too.
649	Best, Jeff
650	Well, it's a start, but it needs work.
650	See you in LA.
650	Hey, I just forgot, you haven't sent me the address of where it is I'm going!
651	No need for thanks.
651	These are busy times.
651	Take care.
652	Thanks.
652	We're going to do it with ENA---dinner at Morton's (yes, it's beef, beef, beef).
652	Then "Stomp" afterwards.
652	Taking place on Friday the 15th.
653	Yes, it did.
653	With many thanks to Scott and Tracy.
654	god bless you.
654	how's the music biz?

655	sorry, was traveling in LA yesterday.
655	what's up.
656	i have a finance midterm and will be at your place around 10 or 10:15, most likely.
656	be happy to chat.
656	i can't believe those fins.
657	Well, you're just a bit late.
657	Peter de Vroede already teamed me with him.
657	But I am honored to have been considered.
657	Thanks.
658	Hi Meg: My understanding is that Peter de Vroede has signed me up with him to room at the offsite.
658	Your records indicate the same?
658	Thanks.
658	Best, Jeff
659	glad to here it.
659	best of luck.
659	let us know the locales of your gigs.
659	be great to see you perform.
659	in any case, hope to see you when you back in best,
660	you, too.
660	thanks.
661	FYI.
661	For meeting with PG&E (which is Tues., Oct. 31, from 10 am-Noon (PDT) in Enron's SF offices. Best, Jeff
662	Jim: To say that there was gaming in the UK pool is a significant understatement.
662	Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in developing rebuttal.
662	(Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed for a few years.) Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that might be another avenue for information to rebut.
662	Best, Jeff
663	Hi Lee: Looks great.
663	Could you do me a favor?
663	You have "generating company" rep on the agenda.
663	Enron does not see itself as a generating company.
663	In fact, the only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in Southern California.
663	Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep?
663	Hope that's not a problem.
663	Best, Jeff
664	My apologies.
664	I thought we had discussed me being on the first panel.
664	Thus, my previous note.
664	I see that I'm on the second, however.
664	Sorry for the confusion.
664	Best, Jeff
665	Yes, 9:35 would be better.
665	Thanks for asking.
665	Best, Jeff Sent by: owner-eveningmba@Haas.Berkeley.EDU Please respond to Diane Dimeff

668	Greetings: I'm interested in renting the entire compound at "Sans Souci"--18 Avenida Farralone in Stinson Beach from December 15th-17th and was wondering if it's available.
668	Thanks very much.
668	Best, Jeff
669	thursday/friday work.
669	wednesday is bad.
670	I could do it in the morning.
670	Say, before 11 am.
670	that work?
671	but my preference is to have it done before 10 am PST---got to catch a flight for houston.
672	need correct pin code for call with sanders.
672	thanks, jeff
673	what's the number?
674	Steve: Attached is a memo that reponds to your question: "Can the solution to the utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative fix required?"
674	As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on the issue.
674	Bottom line: It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the next session.
674	If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let me know.
674	Best, Jeff
675	Thanks for you help, Simon.
675	And Margaret, as always, thank you very much.
676	Actually ordering El Paso to do what TW already does, so if anything, affirms TW's operating procedures.
676	El Paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire industry.
676	Interestingly, this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine, El Paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks.
676	We can discuss further when I'm in Houston tomorrow and Friday.

679	Juslet me know.

679	(Thurs)to square away this issue (maybe around 3 or 4 or so)?
679	My recollection ofour original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition period CTCs as set forth in AB1890, so maybe we just need to broaden or clarify what we mean by "residual CTCs".
679	I'll actually be at 101 Cal starting in the p.m.
679	tomorrow, so this could work out pretty well.
679	Otherwise, I'll be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back inSFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar (Dasovich you're speaking at it?Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too. Sorry for the short notice and I hope I'll at least be able to say hi to everyone tomorrow. Andy
680	I know.
680	Bummer.
680	Hey, I'm leaving for Houstong in about 30 minutes.
680	Could you refresh my memory on what I owe you for the coastal and the acacia and I'll quickly send you a check right now!
680	Thanks again for the lobster and fun last weekend.
680	Sorry I didn't get back on Sunday.
680	I cannot believe the Dolphins.....
681	Did I respond?
681	(Life is nuts; I'm losing it.) Anyway, Peter de Vroede signed my up with him last week (so I'm not sure why I'm still on the list).
681	Anywho, would have been fun.
681	Sorry I'm already booked.
681	Had the midterm last nite--wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though I'm sure I made about a thousand dumb little mistakes.

684	sorry.
684	yes, i can.
685	So it is the 2nd after all?
685	Thought it might be the first, which I could have made.
685	The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).
685	But since it's that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 90 minutes, or so.
685	Will that work?
685	In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.
685	You want to join?
685	And should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?
685	Just let me know.
685	Best, Jeff
686	looks fine to me.

687	16/17, and she, of course, ain't done it.
687	by the way, i may have found a really cool "compound" in stinson beach.
687	could you get in touch with those guys and see if they can do it.
687	sorry to bug you with it, but i think it's best if you guys contact them.
687	thanks a million.

700	FYI.
700	Seems like we've given the Governor quite a bit up to this point, but there may be some good reasons to, as they say, keep on giving.
700	Perhaps we can discuss further as part of our meeting on Monday.

703	I'm glad they want to follow-up with Steve (I've been pushing it) and I've got some follow-up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post-call.

704	Attached for your review are draft talking points for the Cal Energy Markets conference I'm speaking at on Thursday in SF.
704	All comments, suggestions, etc. are appreciated.
704	Thanks.
705	Yes, I would like to participate.
705	Thanks.
706	thanks a million.
706	talk to you then.
707	Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.
707	Have distributed to Western GA team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.
707	Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."
707	Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.
707	The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.
707	Comments are much appreciated.
707	Best, Jeff
708	Chris: As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday.
708	We'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S.D.
708	last week.
708	You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product.
708	You still considering it?
708	Let us know and we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.
708	My flight gets into S.D.
708	at at 8:35 on southwest.
708	Best, Jeff
709	Sandi sez it's actually happening at 10 AM and it's renewable-focused.
710	Here are the messages as I understand them.
710	Please let me know if I've misconstrued anything.
710	Thanks.
710	FERC got a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
710	In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a fundamental step in the right direction.
710	However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility in California.
710	As structured, it will: discourage the development of new generation to serve California fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
710	force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
710	We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap proposal.
710	We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.
711	with "much" of what i said?
712	Got calls in to Richard at PG&E and Reed at Sempra.
712	Will report back.
713	anything you want, honey.
713	I love you.
714	Lord help us.
714	Call whenever you'd like to discuss the call (that Palmer forgot to tell you about).
715	Thank you.
716	My bet is that Pat will be at NARUC.
716	I think that Michael Moore, PhD Economist and CEC commissioner would be very good (I tried Bilas--he's got a conflict) and don't think it's a problem that he and Larson are both on because they'll come with two quite different takes.
716	P.S.
716	FERC dropped a bomb on California today.
717	Apologies.
717	I'm in S.D.
717	with Calger and Dyer to meet w/Sempra tomorrow morning.
718	Will do, thanks.
718	See you at the Alaska gate.
719	Thanks.
719	FYI--I'll be participating on the second panel.
719	Best, Jeff
720	Gee, sounds great.
720	Can't wait.
720	Congratz on keeping the sky from falling out there.
720	Best, Jeff
721	Just got back from Sacramento.
721	Davis still pandering...
722	thanks.
722	let's discuss further.
723	Wanted to make sure that you knew that today FERC declared the cap that the ISO Board voted out last week "null and void," which means that we're back to the old $250 cap.
723	FERC proposed a "soft" $150 cap that would take effect in 60 days, however.
723	Call if you have questions.
723	Best, Jeff
724	My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.
724	Possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project?
724	Either day's fine with me.
724	Apologies for the last minute change.
724	Best, Jeff
725	Is there a suggested time for the meeting?
725	I'm pretty open.
725	I'd like to be sure that Jim and Paul and Mary Karen Denne can participate, too.
725	Do we need to have other commercial folks on the call (e.g., Calger, Belden, someone
726	are you and scott available this weekend to look at the place i'm thinking about renting in stinson for prentice's birthday?
727	thank you very much.
728	Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered on an IEP call today: The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes.
728	Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on board.
728	Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
728	The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
728	Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
728	Much discussion of what California does on the gas side, i.e., set an objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do worse, they take the hit.
728	The utility, under this framework, has broad flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.
728	(FYI: Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy Markets conference.) The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the expertise, to get back into the generation business.
729	I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address.
729	apologies.
729	i'm losing it.
729	did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?
729	If not, do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?
729	i'm in town.
729	just let me know.
729	i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it out.
729	best, Jeff
730	great.
730	you going to the game?
731	that sounds good.
731	what if it's saturday?
731	is there a time you could go?
731	(why so much interest in the niner game?
732	11 am it is on saturday.
732	yes i'm going to see kathy cowlick.
733	Of course, I will be hurt and disappointed if the Sellers family doesn't vote its conscious, doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents the values that the Sellers family stands for.
733	That candidate is, of course, Ralph Nadar.
733	Amen, Jeff P.S.
733	Rory and Timi love Dr. Laura.
734	just got a call from the realtor.
734	they expect us at 11 am at their office in S.B.
734	tomorrow.
734	lalime's (sp?) is cool.
734	ask prentice about it.
735	don't change the subject.
735	vote your concious.
735	gore voted for scalia AND
736	one down, four to go.....
736	god bless scott.
737	OK.
737	Looks like Saturday's out.
737	I'm game for tomorrow.
737	Morning?
737	Afternoon?
737	We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.
737	Let me know.
737	Best, Jeff
738	FYI.
738	My understanding is that Martin and Doug are going to be focused on DG in California.
739	Yes.
739	You can expect it this weekend.
739	My apologies for being tardy.
739	Also, I think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.
739	I can make a contact and I don't think that it's too late to try.
739	He'd be very good.
739	Very close to the governor.
740	FYI.
740	We'll get a call in number first think Monday morning.
740	Paul, do you want to notify Calger, Belden and Thomas in Portland?
741	FYI.
741	How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the table for some time.
741	I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to the current framework.
741	As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy Market conference last week.
741	The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other options--with him.
741	My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the Wright meeting last week.
741	With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.
741	It might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright meeting.
741	Best, Jeff
742	Harry: Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the loop.
742	Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.
742	Sandi, Parquet and Day attended the first meeting last week.
742	I'll forward to you Parquet's notes from the meeting.
742	We'll be setting up a call in number first thing Monday morning.
742	Best, Jeff
743	Here it is.
744	Given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to make California work, would seem useful to strike a balance between the degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms.
744	And for the record, Sue, no I don't talk like that.
744	Best, Jeff
745	Mike: Call Paul and/or Mona about energy attorneys in Arizona.
745	(Paul: 503.464.7945.) Don't give any good talent to our competitors!
745	Best, Jeff
746	The call-in number for the 12:30 (PST)/2:30 (CST) phone call is: dial in: 888.476.6127 code: 125995 Thanks, Jeff
747	Reminder we have a call at 3 PM PST/5 PM CST re: CLEC/Tariff in CA/Authority to dig in CA.
747	We'll use the internal bridge, which I believe is: 888.311.9051 and the code is 60396.
747	Best, Jeff
748	Have a great time in Nashville.
748	Don't forget to vote.
748	Gray gonna be there?
749	We can uninvite steffes, hain, denne, kingerski, comnes if having them on presents any problems.
749	I hadn't included Marcie on the call, but would be happy to include her, too.
749	just let me know.
750	Mary: Please include me in the call with Mr. Sanders & Co. Best, Jeff
751	Ditto.
751	Sounds good.
751	Talk to you tonite.
752	FYI.
752	I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next Monday on the Berkeley campus.
752	It's being sponsored by the Policy School and some folks from the Business School.
752	Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck (Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.
752	Alums who now work in the energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American Public Power Ass.) We're providing a modest stipend.
752	There are two "round tables."
752	First one is "Why did we do this?," and the second one is "Where to from here?"
752	I'll be on the second panel.
752	Go to the attached website for agenda and other info.
752	I intend to pull from the messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of the last several weeks/months.
752	I'll distribute talking points for review and comment sometime this week.
752	But please feel free to send thoughts, suggestions, etc. early and often.
752	Best, Jeff
753	Dear Colleagues, The draft website is ready to go public.
753	It has been linked to the gspp website.
753	It is still the same address: Talk to you all soon.
753	Best wishes, Heather
754	i'm calling marcie as we speak.
755	FYI: Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over email to the world.
755	I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an (unintentional and unnecessary) frenzy.
755	I think she took it well and I think she'll make a practice.
755	Only time will tell.
756	Congratulations.
757	Is this something they've said publicly?
757	If so, have they provided any rationale?
757	Thanks.
758	thank you.
758	if you get a chance, give a jingle and give me the brief rundown on where we left off on part 1.
758	thanks.
759	Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.
759	At that price, the Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on that tasty Reserve.
759	(Kidding!) Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too?
759	GO RALPH!
760	another ugly stereotype that is still alive and well in america.
760	I am so hurt, nancy.
760	so hurt.
761	Greetings Wayne: Sorry that I missed the last meeting.
761	I'll be attending by phone this week, but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our meetings will be weekly).
761	Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.
761	That way I could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on Wednesdays).
761	If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I can continue to do the meetings by phone.
761	But if Thursdays can fit into folks' schedule, that would be great.
761	Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.
761	Best, Jeff
762	Have you drafted any talking points yet?
762	I'm working on what I'll focus on for the conference at Berkeley next Monday and would love to crib from your comments.
762	Best, Jeff
763	and do you get the discount for the 97 Reserve?
764	I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.
764	If I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in. If folks have information (i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.
764	Best, Jeff
765	SF all week.
766	go right ahead and choose me as a reviewer.
767	Wayne: If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.
767	Others: Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?
767	If the meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).
767	Currently, my schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.
767	But Thursdays would work.
767	If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.
767	Best, Jeff
768	You're welcome.
769	Question: re: "cat herding."
769	Do we have the participants list yet?
769	I've got a call in to Smutney (IEP)---Sue talked to him about the cap yesterday and I'm piling on today.
769	If we can give Smutney an alternative to "the $150 cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.
769	Tim: Be useful to know as soon as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no disclosure) is palatable.
769	If other specific CA generators are participating on the panel, we'll need to know who they are in order to "assist" them with their price cap-related comments.
769	Best, Jeff
770	Dave and I talked.
770	I've talked to Chris Foster (midmarket in Portland).
770	He's sending me 1) illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three IOUs, 2) deals we've done with the IOUs to date (only one thus far with PG&E).
770	Laird Dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far Best, Jeff
771	Hi.
771	My palm for some reason isn't syncing.
771	Could you have Chris give me a call to try to get it to work?
771	Thanks a bunch.
771	Best, Jeff
772	Thanks.
772	I can be on the call.
772	One other thing.
772	If there's anything you need me to do re: Bowen's bill for services, don't hesitate to let me know.
772	Best, Jeff
773	de nada
774	Thanks a million.
774	Will keep you in the loop on what's going on between now and Thursday.
774	And don't hesitate if you need anything, or if there's anything that you want to add to the stew.
775	plz call asap re: dow reporter called to talk ISO peakers.
775	thx, jeff
776	plz chk email re: conversation w/smutney on price caps.
776	best, Jeff
777	To help herd cats, might be useful to get to the generators via multiple contact points.
777	My understanding is that the Houston-to-Houston contacts are good ones.
777	We'll continue to work it via IEP and generator contacts here in California.
778	Steve: I'm not sure how far along you are with the comments, but California's insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way of developing a competitive, functional market.
778	The prospect of having Ms. Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact.
778	(Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a "damn the torpedoes" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory risk.) Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.
778	But given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.
778	For the market to work in a structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of the way.
778	Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.
778	A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas procurement.
778	Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.
778	If the utility beats the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.
778	If it does worse than the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.
778	It's a model that works, that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.
778	It ain't perfect, but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that the current PUC has put in place.
778	Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues, but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.
778	Jeff
779	Nope.
780	Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting together (if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots of) beer and pizza and grind through the finance case.
780	We can do it at my apartment, or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.
780	Thoughts?
781	as far as i'm concerned ted' off the team, period.
781	(we kid!) Tomorrow's fine with me.
782	Jeez, you're a superman.
782	Talk to you on the call tomorrow.
783	Your panel: Bill Reed: 619.696.4542 Mike Florio 415.929.8876 Terry Winter: 916.351.2222 Jim Macias: 925.600.2306.
783	Between us, we know them all well.
783	Be happy to help contact.
783	Best, Jeff
784	Couldn't persuade them to stay in D.C.?
784	Ought to be a lot of fun.
784	Hope all's well with all the craziness out there.
784	Best, Jeff
785	Hi.
785	We'll need to add this to the update.
785	Hot off the press.
785	Best, Jeff
786	Can't they stay in D.C.?
787	Good friend of mine's going to Napa to see wineries.
787	Looking for everyone's favorites to pass along.
787	Suggestions?
788	both!
788	"Eldon Sellers" Please respond to eldon
789	How can I get info on deals we've done to you?
789	Jeff
790	will do.
790	best of luck--and have fun (I'm sure you will).
790	best, Jeff
791	thanks, man.
791	what the hell's going to happen????
791	talk about grateful dead.
791	it's an election acid trip.
792	dude, which way's florida going to go?
792	and what happened with the Cal legislature.
792	D's get 2/3's in the senate?
793	Greetings: Any word on when we're set to meet with the AG, (day, time, city?).
793	Thanks a lot.
793	Jeff
794	FYI.
794	Any winery suggestions for my pal?
794	You're guy Jason seems like a great find.
794	Congratulations.
795	i'm off the call.
795	all yours.
795	that ok?
795	kisses.
796	what time's the call tomorrow?
797	Hey: we meeting tonite?
797	can you BELIEVE this bloody election?
798	Steve: Here are the deals and offers.
798	The desk is concerned about two things: 1) that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public.
798	They're fine with general statements like "the offers are below the price cap."
798	2) they have good relationships with the IOUs and the munis and are starting to do a lot of deal; as such, they expressed concern about any comments that might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us (sound familiar)?
798	If there's anything else you need, for if you have any questions about this material.
798	Don't hesitate.
798	Good luck.
798	Best, Jeff
799	Talked to Bill Reed.
799	In his comments, he will say: FERC should be more prescriptive.
799	Can't wait for a new board, made of new people, to act.
799	FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for leadership from FERC.
799	They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him we'd have a similar message on that issue.
799	FERC should "PJM" the California market--I told him we would differ significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and "merging" the PX and the ISO.
799	He said his comments on "refunds" would be "narrow" and would point out that the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific "bad actors" and that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking.
799	I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner.
799	He said that it sounds like a good idea.
799	I told him about our message on price caps.
799	He said that he would stress that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as soon as the market is "functional."
799	Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel tomorrow and talk more.
799	Best, Jeff Best, Jeff
800	We can meet at my meager apartment if you like.
800	Around 7?
801	Sounds good.
801	We SF folks will do 1-4; East Bay folks have 5-7.
802	i have no parking.
802	let's meet at your place.
802	kim and i can carpool and take the "legal" spot.
802	what's the address?
803	Market Surveillance Committee report is smallest file, oldest doc (August), and probably the best message from our prespective, particularly the solutions.
803	PX report is the biggest file and the newest (11.1.00).
804	Check email re: talked to Bill Reed; info on deals in CA; ISO/PX docs.
804	Best, Jeff
805	OK, here's the list: Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat Hess collection. Sterling. Jarvis--truly amazing (and ostentatious--wait till Beth sees the woman's restroom!) But you must call NOW to try to get in. Cordonui (sparkling wine) also has a very lovely view. Stag's Leap. Up valley (Calistoga way) is Chateau Montellana (sp?), which has really wonderful wine. Finally, if you would like, I might be able to tap into a connection and get you in at Opus (Mondavi--maybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere). Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto. And if you want to do Jarvis, call now! Hess Collection. Opus. Sterling. Mondavi. Jarvis (if you can get in).
806	Greetings Folks: As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure out where to go from here.
806	I would argue that what happens with PG&E is equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.
806	As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, longs for the "halcyon days" of command-and-control regulation.
806	As such, I think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.
806	In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts.
806	I think we should employ that approach again.
806	I asked Mike Day, who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.
806	Mike's proposal is attached.
806	Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition, please let me know.
806	Let me know what you think.
806	Hope all is well with you and yours.
806	Best, Jeff Jeff: Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.
806	We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition.
806	In exchange for joining the coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information.
806	I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case.
806	I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case.
806	Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees.
806	However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all participants in the coalition.
806	With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.
806	I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be.
806	Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates.
806	If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know.
806	Thank you for your interest in using our services.
806	Please contact me directly at (415) 765-8408 if you have any questions.

822	Hi Ginger: Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on Monday.
822	I'll be participating in the conference.
822	Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless) "UC Regents" and send it to: Heather Cameron Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy University of California 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA 94720 The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is: 946002123.
822	Thanks very much.
822	If you have any questions, don't hesitate.
822	Best, Jeff
823	Mark: Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.
823	Perhaps the administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a "placeholder" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to "fix" the mess that California refers to as a "market."
823	As such, there hasn't been much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control regulation.
823	However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, which I'll forward in a seperate email.
823	I look forward to seeing Prof. Littlechild at the conference on Monday.
823	He's on the first panel, I'm on the second.
823	I've attached the URL for info on the conference.
823	Best, Jeff
824	well, don't seem to be an electronic copy out there.
824	trying to get a hard copy.
825	plz call re: OPUS.

826	December 2000 HEADLINE: "Perfection in California" AUTHOR: Wilfred Wong SUMMARY: Recommended: 1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that elusive wine that one never finds?
826	In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and for what?
826	Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of perfection.
826	Could this wine finally be the one?
826	This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count).
826	Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers.
826	Persistent to the point of perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of Cabernet ecstasy.
826	Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention.
826	This is my top wine of the year.
826	(Best Served 2002-2018).
826	($130)
827	darling.
827	please.
827	don't taunt me.
827	i'm now too flustered for words.
827	got your page and voicemail.
827	been wrapped up ALL day.
827	i'll try to call later.
827	give me your number again, please.
828	Simon doesn't have Gil Muhl's presentation (job # I have is the "JN" one listed below).
828	Do either of you konw how I might get a copy?
828	Thanks.
828	Best, Jeff P.S.
828	Margaret.
828	Got your voicemail.
828	Thanks.
828	Will call you as soon as I'm able.
829	FYI.
830	OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).
830	But you're on the guest list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).
830	OPUS is across the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.
830	When you get there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up with the complimentary tasting.
830	It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes them to close the gates.
830	If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.
830	You should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a cool place.
830	Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.
830	Later it gets, crazier it gets.
830	I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that you get the attention you deserve.
830	Have a great time.
830	Best, Jeff
831	FYI.
832	Greetings.
832	I really encourage you folks to be in close contact with Robbi and company.
832	Please keep me tightly in the loop about any conversations, activities, etc. Thanks a million.
832	Best, Jeff
833	John: I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting.
833	Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.
833	I apologize---you may have read in the papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.
833	It's taking up a considerable amount of my time these days.
833	I would be happy to reschedule for next week.
833	Wed-Fri.
833	Just let me know.
833	Best, Jeff
834	John: We must thinking alike.
834	I just sent you a note.
834	I apologize, but I need to reschedule.
834	Monday and Tuesday of next week don't work, but Wed.
834	thru Thurs.
834	do.
834	Just let me know what works for you.
834	Again, my apologies, and I look forward to meeting next week.
834	Best, Jeff
835	Monday--Morning office; Afternoon--UC Berkeley participating in roundtable on California electricity crisis Tuesday--AB 1890 implementation group--presentation on gas issues in California Wed--In office Thurs--in office Fri--in office
836	Greetings: Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC hearing that took place today.
836	We've been invited to attend.
836	Focus of hearing: Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather than FERC's.
836	Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.
836	Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California?
836	Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee?
836	("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell group of people.") If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST).
836	Please let me know if this works for folks.
836	And if it does work, Ginger could you set up a call-in number?
836	Best, Jeff
837	This schedule is correct.
838	you're very welcome.
839	Greetings Diane: Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.
839	I'll keep trying!
839	In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 1-unit courses.
839	I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for Management).
839	When do I need to sign up by?
839	Thanks.
839	Best, Jeff
840	Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with you guys.
840	Unbelievable....
840	In any case, congratulations.
840	Sounds like, all in all, it was a good meeting.
840	Scott: has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet?
841	Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody.
841	Amen.
842	the feeling is quite mutual.
842	best,
843	I apologize if I offended anyone.
843	Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in California.
843	Thanks for attributing the quote to me.
843	You did a great job at the hearing----it went decidely downhill after you left.
843	Best, Jeff
844	Thank you for the note.
844	I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, and hope that you can visit the office while your hear to discuss California.
844	How long will you be visiting?
844	Best, Jeff
845	u going to w.palm beach to help christopher?
846	go for it.
846	not enough people fighting any good fights anymore.
846	instead, we get the likes davis and peace.
846	best of luck.
847	thank you very much.
847	i left a message on her voicemail.
847	that oughta do for now.
848	Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday.
848	If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL: I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"
848	I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).
848	There are two documents.
848	One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal.
848	Energy Markets conference last week.
848	The other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.
848	I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the "facilitator."
848	All comments are appreciated.
848	Best, Jeff
849	You coming diving with me and Shea tomorrow?
849	You gotta do it, man.
850	i don't know the exact address.
850	it's between 15th and 16th, same side as the mission.
851	oh boy, you opened the flood gates on this one, missie.
852	Tim: I think this is Rob's new email address.
852	Best, Jeff
853	Hey folks: Here's my rough cut at question #'s 1-4.
853	Let me know what you think.
853	Best, Jeff
854	Greetings.
854	Lately, my email's been mangling addresses when I reply.
854	Just noticed that I got alot of "couldn't send/big error" messages from the answers I emailed out late last nite.
854	Did anyone get them?
854	I'm trying again.
854	Please let me know if you get this one.
854	Thanks, and sorry about the mixup.
854	Best, Jeff
855	That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her.
855	In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.
855	I'll look into setting up a meeting with her.
855	Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is still the best way to go.
855	And if it weren't for the for the "undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move ahead.
855	Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's likely to be where the hearing goes.
855	She's been unable in past to control Peace at her hearings.
855	Best, Jeff
856	Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting.
856	I think that Sue also has a conflict.
856	My thought was to have someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.
856	I'm supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for me to cancel and go to S.D.
856	if we think that it's vital for one of us to be there in person.
856	Thoughts?
856	Best, Jeff
857	Thanks Harry.
857	This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that includes ENA West.
857	Consider it done.
857	Unless others have any problems, I suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. that include ENA also include EES.
857	I don't think that we have any legal issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing something, please let me know.
857	Thoughts?
858	plz call.
858	re: phil harris of PJM is on my panel today.
858	want to discuss.
859	Keep in mind that there will be 3 Davis appointees come the first of the year.
859	Right now the Wilson, Republican commissioners, still hold a 3-2 majority on the Commission.
860	My apologies.
860	Thank you very much.
860	Best, Jeff
861	We said no.
862	If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, that's how we'll handle it.
862	Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.
862	Other commitments win out over FERC's "open mike."
863	Welcome Chris.
863	I can meet during the break.
864	Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday.
864	Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.
864	Mike has now come so far as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you just wait long enough, people come around).
864	Dan Richard did not object.
864	I am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.
864	Dan Richard said things like: I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small customers.
864	I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive market willy nilly.
864	People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.
864	While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening that we should try to exploit.
864	In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the utility live or die by the benchmark.
864	There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the Legislature will get on board.
864	Best, Jeff
865	Can we try Friday at 10 am, again?
866	As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, diversity-loving hipsters.
866	I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to.
866	Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about it.
866	Guess I've mellowed.
866	Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.
866	(I've come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.) Best, Jeff
867	Sorry that I've been incommunicado.
867	At the UC Berkeley conference yesterday, and on my way to an AB 1890 meeting to present on gas in about 5 minutes.
867	Got your message re: PR firm.
867	Sounds good.
867	When I'm back in tomorrow, I'll fill you in on yesterday's conference and today's meeting.
867	Best, Jeff
868	Dub and I are going to go to Stinson/Bolinas to seela the deal on Saturday morning/afternoon prior to going to Napa for Nancy's Bday on Sat night.
868	Would love to have you two join, but worry not if you've got conflicts.
868	Best, Jeff
869	Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm travelling, and if you could leave the call-in number for tomorrow's meeting on my voice mail, I'll be forever indebted.
869	Thanks a bunch.
869	Best, Jeff
870	Thank you very much for the summary.
871	call in number?
872	Glad to hear you're coming.
872	I'll be sure to wear the lime green shirt....
872	Best, Jeff
873	See you then.
874	Sorry, I was out of the office all day.
874	Hope you got there.
875	I don't have any number.
875	You need to just drop by there and buzz the manager.
875	Try from 8-5, when someone's usually there.
875	Sorry, babe.
876	My apologies.
876	I've been meaning to come in, but figured that at some point the Telebears on the Web would work.
876	But no luck.
876	Here are the courses that I'd like to register for.

877	Thanks.
878	FYI.
878	Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity group yesterday.
878	The group was formed out of California's restructuring legislation (AB 1980).
878	It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).
878	The group includes just about all of the interest groups in California.
878	I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed electricity model created by AB 1980.
878	Best, Jeff

881	Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far enough.
881	Arthur Beesley reports Irish Times Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.
881	In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did not go far enough to ensure fair competition.
881	It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense of customers and reliability.
881	The paper has not been published yet.
881	It is believed to state, however, that the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from a competition perspective.
881	The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of the market was opened last February.
881	In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and off as demand for power fluctuates.
881	But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be done to ensure the market operates fairly.
881	The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.
881	'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible.
881	However, the Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will naturally favour itself.' The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms O'Rourke.
881	When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the low-voltage local distribution network.
881	The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its paper.
881	This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in the market, it said.
881	The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

882	Greetings.
882	The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in California.
882	We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.
882	It was in the press.
882	So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals.
882	Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it had planned to developed.
882	I think that they announced the same amount would If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.
882	Best, Jeff
883	Thanks for the heads up.
884	I would like to attend the event with Secretary Summers.
885	Hi Lisa: Just got a call from Rick.
885	He said that 1) The meeting needs to be in San Francisco.
885	2) The meeting needs to be on Dec. 5th.
885	(Not the 29th or the 30th, as previously requested).
885	3) The meeting is mandatory.
885	I'll leave a message for Paul, too.
885	If you have any questions, just give a ring.
885	Best, Jeff
886	Any luck getting on Mike's calendar.
886	FYI: His name is spelled Mike Bentivoglio.
887	that's great.
887	glad to hear it.
887	no thanks necessary.
887	see you tomorrow.
888	Got a call from Rick.
888	Scheduling issues now make it necessary to have the meeting in San Francisco on Dec. 5th at 9 AM.
888	Rick asked that folks make the meeting a priority.
888	Best, Jeff
889	Apologies but the meeting is going to be on Dec. 5th at 9 AM in San Francisco.
889	This date should be pretty darned firm.
889	Best, Jeff
890	Left a message with the good doctor.
890	Will let you know just as soon as I hear.
890	Best, Jeff
891	Can't thank you enough.
891	Great report and I wish that I'd been there with you to experience it.
891	I'd like to stay in touch.
891	It's a high priority of mine to come down there (as I've mentioned a few times).
891	I'm going to try and do it before the month's out.
891	I hope we can have lunch or something and compare notes about all this stuff.
891	This won't be going away for quite some time.
891	Thanks again for your help.
891	Best, Jeff
892	I'll take a wild guess about what will be in the plan.
892	1.
892	Marshall Law 2.
892	Nationalize the grid.
892	3.
892	International energy crimes trial.
893	Dr. Littlechild.
893	I'm very disappointed that our schedules seemed to pass in the night.
893	I had an engagement on Monday night, which regrettably kept me from having dinner with the speakers.
893	And Tuesday I was traveling.
893	I tried to call the Claremont and had a dreadful time trying to leave you a message.
893	If you haven't left the states yet, I would very much like to get together.
893	Otherwise, I'll just have to come to London.
893	I understand that David Teece has filled you in on our discussions.
893	Would like to discuss that futher with you.
893	It was a great pleasure to meet you, however briefly, and I hope that our paths cross again very soon.
893	All the best, Jeff
894	Sue: My understanding is that, based on the discussion that you and Steve and I had last week, you're going to set up a meeting with Tim to discuss this.
894	Something we need to get our arms around fairly quickly.
894	Any possibility of doing it on Monday?
894	Best, Jeff
895	B.O.
895	you hearing any reviews?
895	i think it opened this week, or last week?
895	And I think Cameron's got it right, you guys on the 29th, me and P. Dub-yah on the 6th.
895	Hey, I saw the menu that Nancy sent around.
895	Is she cooking on her own birthday?
896	Meeting from 11:30 to 12:30 but otherwise available.
897	Nov 16,2000 California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.
897	The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity.
897	But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.
897	That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. burn gas and only gas.
897	The units affected this week in San Diego were able to shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil.
897	Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas and generally has been costlier.
897	In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow new heads every day.
897	The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity.
897	Officials had hoped to solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants.
897	Now, they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into a gas problem.
897	One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and electricity affect each other.
897	"We don't just need new generating plants and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.
897	"You can't look at these things in isolation."
897	The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half.
897	In California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating plants.
897	Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil.
897	But it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power plants here need to operate.
897	The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short of power.
897	Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.
897	What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to begin with.
897	The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and not big power plants.
897	The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter.
897	That's because gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last summer.
897	This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of gas in storage.
897	Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less.
897	Prices also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal units to around $8 this week.
897	Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% from a year ago.
897	"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston.
897	But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.
897	High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity.
897	In California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was $228 per megawatt hour.
897	That's double the price a week ago and five times the price a year earlier.
898	Lisa: Sorry, but Joseph's gone on vacation for the week.
898	I think that the size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite.
898	We use the "Park Hyatt" in San Francisco.
898	Could you check with Paul and let him know that I think that we need to go offsite, given the size of the crowd, and if he agrees, could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the Park Hyatt?
898	As always, I'm greatly indebted.
898	If there are any problems, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call.
898	Best, Jeff
899	Dear LYSA: I can only apologize profusely.

902	Thanks very much for you help.
902	Hope it's not a bother.
902	Best, Jeff
903	Glad to hear it.
903	On the down side, it appears that I won't get you that email I promised until tomorrow.
903	If that's totally unacceptable, let me know.
903	Best, Jeff
904	I think that it would be bad if Nancy had to cook her own birthday dinner.....
905	I'm going to try my darnedest to get down there before the month's out.
905	I'll let you know.
905	Best, Jeff
906	Delaney: Here's an electronic copy of my presentation.
906	Thanks for inviting me.
906	Hope it was useful.
906	Best, Jeff
907	We're all over it.
908	he lives.
908	thanks.
908	(no "t" in my last name.) Best, Jeff P.S.
908	when will we know, and who will win?
909	Thank you.
910	where the heck are you?
911	Can you translate this for me?
912	FYI.
912	I'd like to renew.
913	when you find a minute give a call re: message from Sandi.
913	No rush.
913	Best, Jeff
914	why's the market keeping us at 80?
915	hey darlin' (that's Texas talk).
915	how are ya?
915	so good to hear from you.
915	hear you and JC are landed gentry over there in berkeley.
915	next thing you know, you'll be complaining about homeless people and how they're bringing property values down.
915	(tee hee) love to see you guys some time.
915	what about this godfersaken election????
915	if you have a copy of the Berkeleyan, I'd love to get one.
915	My address is: Jeff Enron Corp 101 California St., Suite 1950 SF, CA 94111 How's the Chancelor?
915	Hugs and kisses, Jeff
916	Eldon: If you're willing to get the stuff necessary to make this menu, I'm willing to act as "sous-chef" to Cameron to help make it.
916	Just don' t seem right to have Nancy cook on her birthday.
917	you'll be hearing from me soon.
917	LOVE to get together over the holidays.
917	(everyone from berkeley moved to noe valley---really ruined the place.) give john a big hug.
918	Thanks for hosting, Kim.
918	Jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to get this done (e.g., graphs, make spreadsheet pretty, write-up, etc.).
918	I'lll do whatever needs to be done, so once folks have picked which task they'd like to take on, just let me know what's left.
918	Or if there's another way folks would like to divvy up the chores, that's great, too.
918	Have a great weekend.
918	See you Monday.
918	Jackie, could you email the latest version around when you get a chance?
918	Thanks.
918	Best, Jeff
919	I'm oozing with free time.
919	Monday sounds great.
919	Thanks.
920	Sure Sue has filled you in, but just to be certain, my understanding is that Dan Douglas, attorney for WPTF, is going to meet with the AG (not sure when) in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena.
920	Dan also plans to begin drafting responses to the subpeona.
920	Since we are a member of WPTF and therefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our attorney's coordinate with Dan.
920	Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know.
920	Best, Jeff
921	Congratulations.
921	Even though it's the EEI agreement, getting Edison to agree to sign something is an achievement.
921	Good luck landing deals.
921	Jeff
922	Guess this means we support it?
922	(Kidding.)
923	Cool.
923	Thanks for the info.
924	FYI.
924	Sure the desk wants the details kept confidential, but thought folks might be interested to know.
925	Rob: Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta may not want to repeat.
925	Steve, let me know if I've missed any messages we're using to describe California's woes (or mangled any, for that matter. If you have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch. Best, Jeff
926	Great presentation, but the message seems a little blurred.
927	OK.
927	It's done.
927	Got two places.
927	One sleeps 8 and is big and is where we can have the party.
927	The other sleeps 6 and is very close by.
927	Right on the beach, so surfing will be a must.
927	Who is on your list for invites so far?
928	Dave/Sandi: FYI.
928	In Joseph's absence, his fill-in asked that I take a call yesterday from the Mayor's office.
928	They called to confirm the meeting set up for Dave, Mike Day and Bev Hanson on Nov. 29th at 4 PM to discuss the serious electricity shortage in SF.
928	Best, Jeff
929	Chuckles is a must invite.
930	Counting on Paul.
931	I'm adding my two cents.
931	Here's 3, but not 4.
931	Few things.
931	1) I considered that everything was "material."
931	That reasonable?
931	2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.
931	But a case for extra can still, be made I think.
931	3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken in 1994, as opposed to a "potential litigation outcome" that they'd make an allowance for---I could be wrong, though.
931	4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included in the 1995 "income from continuing operations" number, and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement.
931	I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and circulate.
931	Best, Jeff
932	OK.
932	Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's #4.
932	Most significant issue: the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add them).
932	No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it.
932	There's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to #4--again, just need to make the call either way.
932	Best, Jeff
933	My understanding is the same.
933	Content looks good.
933	Message points been developed in the event they're needed?
933	Best, Jeff
934	Will have any comments to you pronto.
935	See attached.
935	Just a couple of typos corrected in strike-out-underline.
935	Question: Thought I'd included the gain on sale as "unusual" as opposed to "extraordinary."
935	If we leave it out, are we assuming it's already included in the $9.5MM?
935	If so, we might want to include a note at the bottom of the spreadsheet like, $9.5 MM figure includes $750,000 gain on sale of certain assets completed in 1995."
935	Or am I just totally out lunch on this one. Thanks. This one was a little messy. You did a great job of pulling it together. Best, Jeff
936	My suggested edits are in CAPS.
937	FYI.
938	I like it.
938	Give it one final read through for final refinements.
938	Then send to bay guardian, sf weekly, pacific sun (marin), (and the east bay has a weekly mag, too, the name of which escapes me--might be out of berkeley).
938	Any of these would give good exposure, and likelihood of someone of your caliber getting in is pretty high.
939	get better.
940	No problem.
941	Hi, Marcie.
941	I've added two things to the end of the update: PG&E/Edison sue the PUC in federal court to recover procurement costs.
941	Edison files proposal with PUC to declare rate freeze is over and establish a new rate freeze at 110% of old rate freeze that would last for 5 years.
941	I don't have all the details to fill in, though some of the details might be available from the PG&E/Edison websites, and Sue and Mona might have additional info.
941	Hope this helps.
941	Best, Jeff
942	Might be useful to observe how others react prior to responding.
942	The good senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to spend the $$s on school books.
942	That fight could get interesting if the backdrop for the debate is a CEC report that sez "no problem, we're in charge."
942	I'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $2 billion...
943	my pleasure.
944	No, you're correct.
944	In the spreadsheet, there were three sorts of "items": discontinued ops, unusual items, extraordinary items, and accounting changes.
944	The sale of the assets came about in the attempt to "trim the fat" (or manage earnings, you make the call).
944	Here's the line item from my spreadsheet: It came right after the entries for the "unusual loss from the government ban."
944	I included it with the "unusual" items (right after discontinued ops and right before extraordinary items. Big question is, is it included already. I assumed not, since (though it's confusing), the problem makes is sound like none of the additional "agenda items" were accounted for. I don't think it's a huge deal, though. The questions left a lot of room for ambiguity. Best, Jeff
945	I agree completely, which is why I think the *$(*#-ed case is confusing. Let it go. Leave as is. Think about it no more. See you tonite. Jeff
946	great time.
946	thanks a million.
946	sorry i had to do homework for some of it.
946	what would you like me to cook/bring for friday?
946	i make a mean oyster stuffing.
946	and my homemade cranberry sauce is ok, too.
946	just let me know.
947	FYI.
948	OK!!!
948	I don't put my stuffing in the bird!!!
948	The more cranberries the better!!!
948	Yours truly!!!!
948	Jeff!!!
948	p.s.
948	how did pittsburg lose??!?!?!?!??!?!?!??
949	I don't get it.
949	What does she want to do?
950	i know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
951	These performance reviews may push me right over the edge.
951	Good talking to you earlier.
951	Sounded like the Paul I know and admire.
951	You sounded energized.
951	Looking forward to having you around more.
951	One thing.
951	Please don't count December out as a possible start time for the special session.
951	Anything can happen.
951	Book your hotel room early.
951	Best, Jeff
952	There's a place for working and re-working.
952	There's also a a very important place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim.
952	I'd do a tweak here and a snip there, but quickly and only around the edges, and submit it as a film review.
952	It's novel, it's fun, and exposure'd a good thing.
952	Things are good.
952	Going to be weary for the next 3-4 weeks until schools out, though.
952	Best, Jeff
953	Rick: Just want to let you know that I missed the boat a bit in coordinating my reviewers with Paul.
953	In my first attempt to input them in the system, I hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.
953	When I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.
953	It's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system, but I wanted to let you know that, from my perspective, it would be great to receive from you.
953	I'd value it a lot.
953	And I think we've worked closely enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me.
953	But again, I'm of the view that irrespective of the list, you partake in my review of necessity, and I don't want to add any additional burdens to an already loaded schedule.
953	No big deal, just wanted to let you know.
953	And I'm having a field day filling out your review.
953	("Rick discriminates unfairly against neon-colored shirts.") Seriously, I was quite pleasantly surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers.
953	Best, Jeff
954	I threw out the green shirt.
954	Swear to god.
955	It's a never-ending cavalcade....
956	Here's the report that Sue referenced earlier.
956	Appears that the administration's analysis of California's energy problems will continue to focus solely on the "bad actor" conspiracy theory.
957	Congratulations.
957	And count me in. We're off to the races.
957	Best, Jeff And a very Happy Thanksgiving.
958	Here's what I need (thanks, honey): 3 bags of fresh cranberries 2 oranges box of brown sugar 6 jars of oysters 6 loaves of bread (get the "rounds" of bread---vary them, like olive bread, sour dough, sweet, whole grain, potato) thing of celery 4 large yellow onions couple bulbs of garlic 2 pounds of butter (clover, salted) Thanks, sweetie, and good luck on your midterm!
959	Forgive the tardiness.
959	As soon as I come up from air from completing a tidal wave of performance reviews, I'll give a full report.
959	Bottom line: His message is a very good one.
959	His delivery could use a tad spicing up, however.
959	Unfortunately, when I was free, he was in meetings, and vice versa.
959	So we never got to sit down and chat.
959	I'll fill you in more soon.
959	Best, Jeff
960	I can attest to the fact that you hit the bulls-eye, dead center, sir, with your description.
960	But again, the message is great, and his written stuff, I think, is effective.
960	Your decision to help fund his participation was an extremely good one in the end.
960	Best, Jeff
961	Don't hesitate to call and discuss further the "hard lessons" that I sent you.
961	I may want to amend the ISO RFP numbers just a wee bit, too, before (and if) you use them.
961	Best, Jeff
962	Doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity, but through a contact, I've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to network performance (optical routing technology).
962	I'd like to hook them up with network folks, both a technical and a commercial person.
962	Anyone suggestions?
962	Thanks.
962	Best, Jeff
963	I'm forever indebted.
963	Best, Jeff
964	If possible, that would be perfect, and greatly appreciated.
965	could you please follow up with stephanie and let her know that i'd like to review?
965	thanks very much.
966	Sorry Stephanie, I meant to send the previous note to Joseph.
967	bet you're having fun.
967	are there comments that accompany Alan's tech piece?
968	thanks.
968	would it be a violation of interstate commerce to keep press from alberta from crossing the border into the states?
969	ok.
969	i'm on for stuffing and cranberry sauce.
970	Sure this is just what you needed.
970	Best of luck.
970	Best, Jeff
971	neat!
971	don't worry, i'm excited to cook!!!!
971	i'll try to do it in advance!!!!
971	but if i can't, i'll need to cook at your place!!!!
971	that ok?!?!?!!!!!!
971	see you soon!!!!!
971	Best!
971	Jeff!
971	P.S.
971	it's 3:14 PM!!!!!!
972	I'd leave a voicemail with Sandi (she's taking voicemail on her trip) and ask her if she'd like for you to contact them.
973	got your message.
973	a hearty congratulations on the portland general approval from ferc.
973	i'm chained to my desk doing reviews.
973	best, Jeff
974	Alberta?
975	I'm not sure which is worse, the story, or the timing.
975	You psyched about the FERC approval?
975	And is there a story behind the sale of Sierra's power plants?
976	Now wait one darn minute, lil' lady (do you hear John Wayne's voice?).
976	The price cap in California remains--that's right, remains--at a lofty $250/Mwh.
976	Thank you, Government Affairs.
976	Seriously, seems reportable, given that at one point it had moved to a time-differentiated cap.
977	plz try me again.
977	thx,jeff 415.782.7822
978	Agree that we should decline to participate.
978	I also got a call from IEP regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.
978	Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff.
978	Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day that the report is released.
978	For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of wisdom.
979	If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the auspices of IEP.
979	We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.
979	If we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely aligned/associated with them we want to be.
979	Further we distance ourselves, less likely we'll be cut in. That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.
979	There was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of "price cap" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.
979	There were differences of opinion about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.
979	We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that California could do to "fix" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the need for caps altogether.
979	We also recognized the political nature of the situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.
979	That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the "PUC as counterparty" policy that currently exists.
979	Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.
979	Will check around, though.
979	Best, Jeff
980	I'll check with Smutney.
980	Can you two check with your Dynegy and Reliant contacts in Houston?
981	I'm available.
982	How about $1 billion to build some new pipelines in California?
982	To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: A chicken in every pot Hey, Wouldn't this fix everything?
982	What a great idea- a govenment owned utility.
982	Who in their right mind would want to give the money back to taxpayers?
982	I think Enron should cast aside its dependency on free markets,and throw its support behind this well thought out public initiative.
982	Let us know how Transwestern can help!
982	Calif. lawmaker pushes for state energy reserve California State Sen. Steve Peace called for the state to set aside $2 billion of a projected $10 billion budget surplus to create a reserve account to serve the state,senergy needs.
982	A representative at Peace,s office said the senator planned the fund as a &cushion8 to help the state bounce back from energy price shocks like those that hit it lastsummer.
982	Peace, speaking Monday at a briefing on the upcoming state budget, suggestethat the California Legislature set aside $2 billion to use at a later date.
982	The funds could be included in the budget that Gov. Gray Davis is scheduled to announce Jan. 10.
982	Ostensibly, the government could use the funds to purchase some of the state,s transmission grid angeneration assets, or to build new assets.
982	In his remarks, Peace said some of the $2 billion could be used to build a500-MW generation facility, which he estimates at $300 million, a peaker that could be set upfor $16 million, or a transmission grid such as the $200 million system a California utilityhas proposed for the southern part of the state.
982	&The use of public dollars to finance development, private-public partnerships, or to capitalize publicly owned utilities are all options which California policymakers mayhave to consider if [FERC] is unable to bring wholesale energy markets under control,8 he said.
982	Still, representatives at the senator,s office stressed that Peace was nmaking any policy decisions in his statement.
982	Rather, a representative said, Peace was actingin his capacity as chairman of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Committee and setting aside fundsthat can be available for future use.
982	Peace,s initiative comes on the heels of a report by the Legislature,Legislative Analysis Office forecasting a $10.3 billion surplus for fiscal years 2000-2002 (a $6billion surplus for 2000-2001 and a $3.4 billion surplus for 2001-2002).
983	What's the latest tally in Florida?
983	It gets increasingly important every time Richardson opens his gawd-fersaken mouth.
984	Unless Loretta Lynch, or worse, Gray Davis are your counter parties.
985	you do the same, buddy.
986	Hey, fearless, leader.
986	You going to distribute that spreadsheet?
986	And when do we need to regroup.
986	Happy Thanksgiving.
986	I'll report by on my conversations with Mike.
986	Best, Jeff
987	thank you.
988	Hey: Just wanted to let you know that I've received all the SDG&E stuff and that you can count on me to completely drop the ball.
988	Kidding!
988	I'll take care of it.
988	I'm still awash in reviews and may not ever leave the building, which is why I'm not responding as promptly as I should.
988	Best, Jeff
989	Jim: Have a great Thanksgiving with your family.
989	It's a great pleasure doing business with you.
989	Best, Jeff
990	Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.
990	The very good news, though, is that TW's proposal was included in both settlements (now that's hedging!).
990	Thus, the benefits to TW were preserved under both proposals.
990	Congratulations.
990	That's fantastic--hard work that paid off.
990	We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.
990	We should discuss.
990	Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.
990	Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.
990	But we have a knack of making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, whatever turns up at the end.
990	Best, Jeff
991	monday--LA w/S.
991	Kean re: meeting w/Gov's staff tuesday--in office thurs/fri--houston re: EBS meetings
992	are you offering a finder's fee?
992	i'm cheap.
993	Thanks, all.
993	I'll get a compiled answer out later today.
994	Aleck: I'll take a look at it.
994	If I have any comments, I'll forward them along.
994	Also, I may forward along some very slight changes to the numbers on the ISO's RFP "experience," should you decide you want to incorporate those "lessons" into your presentation.
994	I'll provide any amendments to those numbers by tomorrow.
994	Best, Jeff
995	OK folks, here it is.
995	Sorry for the delay, but those pesky questions ended up being more detailed than I anticipated.
995	Please take a quick look and let me know if there are any comments---more ambiguities than usual in this one.
995	I'll await comments and finalize this evening.
995	Jimmie/Dylan--my apologies, but last Wednesday evening, I found out that I have to be in LA for a meeting tomorrow.
995	If I make it to class at all tomorrow, I won't get there until after the break.
995	Could one of you print out the case and bring it to class?
995	If not, don' t sweat it, I'll email him an electronic and turn in a hard copy to him on Tuesday.
995	Sorry for any hassle.
995	Best, Jeff
996	Thanks.
996	I'll soften the expropriation language.
996	I don't think they can disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire package appears to be one negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to be agreed to, or no settlement.
996	But you're point's well taken and I'll try to acount for it in the answer.
996	Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.
996	Seems like I'd have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted it to it in my annual report.
996	If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week.
997	see you at the freight.
997	best,
998	Greetings Professor: I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and have been called out of town on business at the last minute.
998	As a result, if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until after the break.
998	While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?) by emailing a copy as well.
998	Best, Jeff
999	Folks: Here's the final.
999	I incorporated some comments from Christine and emailed a copy to Aceves.
999	Jimmie/Dylan let me know if one of you can bring a hard copy to class tomorrow.
999	If not, he's now got an electronic copy, and I'll drop off a hard copy on Tuesday.
999	Hope to see you (for at least half the class) tomorrow.
999	Best, Jeff
1000	You're the man.
1000	I got some comments from Christine (sort of).
1000	See most recent email.
1000	I emailed it to Aceves, but if more changes come in, I don't see any problem telling him to disregard the email and use the hard copy you turn in tomorrow.
1000	Thanks a million.
1000	Greatly appreciated.
1000	I owe you one.
1000	This one was really a hot potato.
1000	First Kim, then me, now you.
1000	Best, Jeff
1001	$1 million.
1001	p.s.
1001	the plant i was talking about is: "hairy vetch" or "purple vetch."
1001	i'll look for some.
1001	you should, too.
1001	if you find any, make sure it's "organic" and hasn't had any chemicals added to the seeds.
1001	thanks again for a fantastic time over Thanksgiving.
1001	I had a lot of fun.
1002	Ferget it.
1003	Folks.
1003	Let me throw out a proposal.
1003	I believe that we should immediately draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.
1003	The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.
1003	It needs to be released by the end of this week.
1003	Absent this kind of action, nothing's going to turn this thing around.
1003	Spending time and money writing "comments" will be a waste of time and money.
1003	We'll need to do a lot more, but I think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now.
1003	Thoughts?
1003	Best, Jeff
1004	Greetings Linda: Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.
1004	Just wanted to pass along some info.
1004	I'm sure you've seen Senator Feinstein's comments to FERC.
1004	And I think you're aware that she held a meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.
1004	She stated at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.
1004	Economists in the room expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.
1004	Not sure where it will go, but wanted to pass it along.
1004	Best, Jeff
1005	I'm not buying and goddam banjo.
1005	I can't stand the noise those freakin' things make.
1005	ferget it.
1005	we kid!
1005	I think that's it's a swell idea.
1005	you can totally count me in on pitching in. (i'm declaring bankruptcy after this birthday.) let's talk more tonite about the big day.
1005	I have class, but should be over there by 10:30 or so.
1005	Best,
1006	My apologies, Linda.
1006	Sometimes it pays to see what name pops up from the Enron address book before hitting the send button.
1006	And thanks, Rick.
1006	I'll note the two r's in Rrobertson.
1006	Best, Jeff
1007	Hey.
1007	Whoa.
1007	I already got Cameron a garlic press.
1007	And I got her mom a spatula, so don't go trying to preempt that gift, too.
1008	The black boots are mine.

1009	FYI.
1010	not sure, but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine.
1010	is it for guitar?
1011	I'll need to ponder.
1011	I'll try to get back to you pronto.
1012	FYI.
1012	We have this report?
1013	Hi David: Thought that you might be interested.
1013	Best, Jeff
1014	Well, he launched today.
1014	Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today?
1014	I think this is actually a good thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken system---a potential spoiler.
1015	Hi.
1015	Well, wouldn't you know it.
1015	I'm not driving tonite, but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil.
1015	I'm not sure, but I think that he's got class tonite, too.
1015	I'll search him out before class or after that break and see if I can set it up.
1016	Oh come on.
1016	I heard that you're a ghost writer for Harvey's proposal!
1016	Kidding.
1016	Seriously, it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you lately.
1016	I have a picture of the two of us from the Berkeley conference I'll pass along to you.
1016	I really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the industry.
1016	Look forward to working on it.
1016	Best, Jeff P.S.
1016	Don't have TOO much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of Peace and the IOUs.
1017	Hi Aleck: How did your talk go?
1017	I hope well.
1017	If you're refering to the PX study on whether to have an "as-bid" or "single-price" auction, the PX is in the preliminary stages of having a report prepared.
1017	What they've done is assemble a "Blue Ribbon" panel of economists (as reported in the press accounts you've seen) to examine the issue and report back.
1017	I'm not aware of a report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the PX.
1017	Have you heard differently?
1017	I'll poke around.
1017	Best, Jeff
1018	Thanks, Delaney.
1018	See you on Friday.
1018	Quick comment: Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).
1018	Seems that a key--if not dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.
1018	Sure you folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.
1018	In any case, just a thought that I wanted to share.
1018	Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.
1018	Best, Jeff
1019	Here is CLECA's (Barbara Barkovich's) current thinking.
1020	left a message.
1020	sense is likely won't release till post-press conference.
1020	will keep trying.
1020	jeff
1021	Hmmmm, I think you're right.
1021	Looks like the more we can get done tonite, the better.
1021	Perhaps, if we can wrap the analysis up this evening, we can do some serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting.
1021	Then folks can go off and complete the assignments between now and Sunday, which should make Sunday's activities pretty light.
1021	That make any sense?
1021	Best, Jeff
1022	California Large Energy Consumers Association
1023	Shoot, I'll be in Houston...
1024	yes, i found that out yesterday, too.
1025	I suggest a quick conference call to discuss.
1025	How's tomorrow (Thursday) at 2 pm work for folks?
1025	Let me know and I'll set up a call-in number.
1026	Can you get this kind person the info?
1026	Thanks very much.
1027	what's your guys' view on this?
1028	Mike: I'll be covering all of this stuff for myself, so unless we agree in advance to you spending your time, I won't be expecting any bills.
1028	If Paul's covering your time for the call, I think it would be great for you to participate.
1028	The reaction's been pretty good thus far.
1028	Best, Jeff
1029	Could you please set up a call for tomorrow at 2pm for one hour and forward the info to the distribution list below?
1029	Thanks.
1030	Got 'em.
1030	Thanks.
1031	Thanks, Zenee.
1031	I will participate by phone.

1033	Nice.
1033	I like it.
1033	Gosh you guys are good.
1033	Luntz stuff is on its way.
1034	Karen: Be sure you get from Steve or Rick or Jim or Mark the final materials that Luntz and Co. produced.
1034	What I've forward to you are the "works in progress" pieces from last summer---all I have.They're in the "California Media Strategy" binder.
1035	could you pick my ticket up for me?

1041	And it will just suck if you're not there.
1041	Huge hugs, very wet kisses.
1042	you have made me very happy.
1043	OJ for President!
1044	Hi.
1044	Thanks for the note.
1044	Couple of things.
1044	Prentice is going to do Xmas with us this year cuz her family will be out of town.
1044	So we should absolutely include her, but I think she really wants to be included in the "picking" so that she gets someone's name.
1044	If you'd like to pick the names and let people know, I'm completely comfortable with that.
1044	(Confidentially, I have a great idea for Mike, so if, by chance, I get him as a pick, that would be great!) Also, let me throw this out.
1044	You know that if I didn't live in a 1-bedroom apartment, I'd host (and hopefully, we'll be having Xmas at my place in Mendocino a few years down the road).
1044	Steve and Charry really carry the load all the time.
1044	Have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your place?
1044	I'd be happy to take care of the meal, and hang around to clean up afterwards.
1044	No big deal, just a thought.
1044	Alternatively, we could absolutely have it at Prentice's apartment, which is plenty big enough, and will have a big beautiful tree, etc. So give that a thought.
1044	Might be nice to do it in the city, and we'd be happy to host it there, too.
1044	Now, the important stuff.
1044	What do Katie and Michael want/need for Xmas?
1044	Best, Jeff
1045	Super.
1045	Thanks a bunch.
1045	See you tomorrow.
1045	"Delaney Hunter" Please respond to dhunter
1046	FYI.
1046	In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.
1046	Granted, we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review the Hogan piece.
1046	Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn "analysis" (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).
1046	Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan & Co. If, in the end, there ain't nothing useful, so be it.
1046	But seems like there's little downside to exploring it.
1046	Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.
1046	Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.
1046	Ultimately, may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather than directly from us.
1046	Best, Jeff
1047	you're fired.
1048	At this point, yes, that's sort of how I feel about it.
1048	Unless someone can come up with some damned good reasons to do otherwise.
1049	You bet.
1049	Got your and Fran's messages.
1049	If you'd like to discuss by phone, I'm in all day.
1049	Otherwise, I suggest that we do take the following next steps: Just as soon as you have the proposal and list of participants drafted (which I hope will be very soon), please forward to me.
1049	Then, as quickly as possible, I'd like to have a meeting to discuss and finalize the proposal.
1049	It would be very useful if Laura Tyson could be in on that final meeting, and, of course, any other of the participants that you'd like to invite.
1049	We're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in getting this thing off the ground.
1049	If we're going to do it, it's going to have to come together quickly, and the report will have to be developed very quickly, too.
1049	Hope that will be possible.
1049	I'm assuming at this point that you and I are proceeding ahead absent Mitch and Carl, since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't seem to overcome?
1049	And I'll inquire about the need for expert witnesses in the class action suit and get back to you.
1049	Best, Jeff
1050	no.
1050	you're fired, but you have to stay.
1051	could you please print this out for me.
1051	greatly indebted.
1052	man, do i OWE you a phone call.
1052	please don't hold it against me.
1052	sort of well, you know, a little nuts right now.
1052	but i will reconnect.
1052	i promise.
1053	Thanks.
1053	With that, unless I hear otherwise from folks by 4 PM PST---and alsuggestions on how to make the comment better are welcome and appreciated---I'll go ahead and forward on to Art O'Donnell.
1053	Richard Shapiro To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron , Paul Subject: Re: Press Statement on Bad PUC Gas Decision?

1053	Laying low and working backchannels isworking great so far???
1053	NOT
1054	Greetings Art.
1054	Had a great time at the conference.
1054	Thanks for inviting me.
1054	I have a comment about the proposed decision if you'd like it.
1054	Let me know.
1054	What time do you need it?
1054	And can I just email it to you?
1054	It'll be quite brief and to the point.
1054	Best, Jeff
1055	Yep.
1055	Thanks.
1056	That is music to my ears.
1056	Can't tell you how much you're help is valued.
1056	Really would like to discuss this further.
1056	And a hearty congratulations on the promotion, Pat.
1057	I don't recall agreeing to any of this.
1057	We kid!
1057	Looks fine to me.
1058	This looks good.
1058	Is there any value in assigning people to the agenda items, e.g., "Special Session"--Sandi and Sac lobbyists"?
1059	Yep.
1059	But Norm's wrong.
1059	It always gets darkest before the light.....
1060	That's what Eric said about the red outfit that Kari Dohn was wearing on Monday.....

1068	Hi Sue: I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that something invariably happens that creates havoc.
1068	Good luck.
1068	I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought I'd give you a quick update: Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and install some facilities in California.
1068	With some effort, we persuaded Scott that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).
1068	Instead, Scott's going to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the project entails.
1068	Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame for approval would look like.
1068	Scott agrees with this approach.
1068	He's going to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.
1068	We likely will regroup to figure out "next steps" right after the first of the year.
1068	Have any thoughts on this approach?
1068	I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.
1068	However, this Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area) have had a little "special event" planned for the past 6 months.
1068	Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with everyone.
1068	I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by phone.
1068	Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule: "Family and relationships first!"
1068	Hope all is well.
1068	Best, Jeff
1069	Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the "California Energy Solutions Group" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).
1069	But for the issues discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.
1069	At our urging, the group decided to form a "subcommittee" comprised of a subset of the group.
1069	The group will work quickly to develop a "strawperson" proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.
1069	The goal is to quickly arrive at a "settlement"---ideally by year end, or sooner---that everyone can agree to and offer up to Davis, legislators, etc. Our "reward" for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on the "committee."
1069	In addition to us, the other people on the committee are: Eve Elsesser will chair the committee---Cogen types John Fielder---Edison Mike Florio--TURN Bill Booth---CLECA Carolyn McIntyre---Sempra Aaron Thomas--AES (retail) Tony Braun--Munis Ralph Cavanagh--NRDC John Flory--CALPX It is clear that one of the key issues is devising the "benchmark" that the CPUC can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.
1069	Chris Calger is in the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark.
1069	We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.
1069	The first meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.
1069	If possible, I'd like to add the "benchmark" and "committee" issues to our agenda for Tuesday's meeting.
1069	Best, Jeff
1070	Greetings: We are getting considerable traction with the idea of using a "benchmark" to judge utility purchases, similar in concept to what's in place on the gas side.
1070	To oversimplify it: 1) set the benchmark 2) the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark 3) if (at the end of the year) the utility has beat the benchmark, it shares the profits with consumers; if the benchmark wins, the utility shares the losses with consumers 4) the PUC performs no "after-the-fact" reasonableness; no "second-guessing" California likes the idea and is now looking to Enron to come up with what the benchmark ought to be.
1070	I talked to Calger a bit about it today and he suggested that I get together with you guys.
1070	As always, time's short.
1070	Are you available on Monday?
1070	Thanks, Jeff
1071	She was at attention, throughout the meeting.....
1072	Thanks very much, Doug.
1073	Apologies.
1073	I've had to focus a bit on the finance project (and slogging through the case has been long and painful).
1073	I'll have my responses to 1-3 to Kim later this afternoon.
1074	I didn't get an email on German GAAP from the professor.
1075	Here's the exec sum draft that distributed hard copies of today.
1075	it's going to change quite a bit based on today's work.
1075	i'll try to turn it around by tomorrow for folks to look at.
1076	Ditto, Christine: I've proposed some edits (for what they're worth) to Christine's fine work.
1076	Kim, this case has left me brain dead ("compare the differences between the US Consitutation and the Magna Carta"---give me a break), so you may want to make sure that I haven't made any outrageous typos.
1076	Best, Jeff
1077	Greetings.
1077	I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference calling beginning at 2 pm.
1077	Is that possible.
1077	If not, no big deal.
1077	I, like Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between now and then.
1077	Let me know.
1077	And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on the most urgent issues.
1077	Best, Jeff
1078	Very glad to here that things have gone well thus far.
1078	I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the good luck continues!
1078	If we don't talk between now and Thursday, we'll talk then.
1078	Best, Jeff
1079	Not sure that you were on the email list for this.
1079	Who's "Chris Fair?"
1079	I don't think that's you.
1080	Great.
1080	How's 2 PM today?
1081	I think at this point, any more changes, and we're going to blow our collective brains out.
1081	But here's a question.
1081	What interest rate did we use to calculate the interest the County receives on its "ending balance?"
1081	Ted, you likely have a much better feel for this, but should it be something like the 3-month commercial paper rate, or something?
1081	Did we use the 20-year treasury?
1081	Again, I think we likely ought leave the thing along at this point, but thought I'd throw it out there.
1081	Tell me that it doesn't matter, please.
1081	And Ted, I thought we agreed that the interest rate was 5.720928373983039 (kidding).
1081	Jackie: Good luck with Schwab.
1081	I'll keep my fingers and toes crossed.
1081	Best, Jeff
1082	I agree.
1082	My expectations for the new "California Energy Solutions Group" are low, but willing to give it a go.
1082	I'm planning on having the piece done by lunch---working on it now.
1082	Attached is the first message; there are 3 more messages, or so, which will only be (no more than) one more page.
1083	New Yorker reviews Henry Moss in this week's issue.
1083	Haven't read it yet.
1083	Did you guys like it?
1083	Cameron, what's the name of the bandwidth exchange firm that you guys did your deal with?
1083	Bandwidth Exchange?
1083	(I"m brain dead.)
1084	Got your message re: reverse auction all of the utility's demand.
1084	Getting (interestingly complicated), though.
1084	Now, the utilities want to create a "core/noncore" split in electricity, like in gas (where large gas customers can't take commodity from the utility).
1084	With a core/noncore split, Edison claims that QF contracts, nukes and other existing generation that it still holds is sufficient to meet "core" needs and it therefore may not need "contracts."
1084	As you can imagine, large customers ain't clamoring to get thrown into the market as "noncore" customers right about now.
1084	But they may find themselves without a choice.
1084	I talked to Calger on Friday about reverse auction versus benchmark and I'll be talking to the traders about it this afternoon, and we'll be discussing further when Rick, Steffes et al are here tomorrow.
1084	Will let you know where it goes.
1084	Best, Jeff
1085	Talk to you then.
1086	Hi Michelle: Guess who?
1086	Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, leaving 27.
1086	I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours.
1086	Please tell me that I am.
1086	Thanks very much.
1086	Signed, Desperately in need of vacation Also, I clicked on deferral enrollment, and by-golly if I couldn't find the election form to download.
1086	Am I just clueless, or is there another place that I need to look for it?
1086	Thanks a million.
1087	Sounds good.
1088	thanks.
1088	we should talk more about the perfect deal----if it's still something that you think is worth pursuing.
1088	you didn't think henry moss was the cat's meow, did you?
1089	I think that you're wondering is right on target.
1090	Hi: Though I'll miss the meeting (if it's over by 2 PM), I'll be able to give you our ideas on the agenda items tomorrow.
1090	If there's anything else, just let me know.
1090	Best, Jeff
1091	Please keep this confidential at this point.
1091	It's the agenda for the California "subcommittee" meeting on Tuesday that I mentioned in an earlier note.
1091	They were unable to reschedule the meeting, which starts at 10 AM tomorrow, but we're on the subcommitte and will have very good access to the final product, so I'm not too concerned about missing the "kickoff" meeting.
1091	Folks in California are really looking to us to help figure out item #2 "forward contracting."
1091	It would be very useful to discuss this outline tomorrow while we're all together.
1091	Best, Jeff
1092	good point.
1092	if you'd like to include it in this draft, i'm fine with that---we certainly have been very vocal about the need to reform it.
1092	alternatively, we could discuss with the larger group tomorrow whether we weigh in heavily and if so what our exact message ought to be.
1092	either way works for me, just let me know.
1093	thanks.
1093	my assumption is that, with respect to power plant siting and what we ought to do, you'll take the lead tomorrow.
1093	does it make sense for now to leave a "placeholder' under that one and we can discuss further tomorrow, or would you prefer to put a specific item in there now, like "Legislature should revisit last session's streamlining bill?"
1094	you're cash flow spreadsheet is freakin' awesome.
1094	nice job.
1095	can you please call me?
1095	i'm trying to input the numbers from the spreadsheet into the exec sum, and have a question.
1095	thanks.
1095	415.782.7822.
1096	Thank you so much.
1096	Really sorry to bother you so much.
1097	Just had a long internal meeting.
1097	Over the next 24 hours, we're going to try to simulate on California a potential solution we devised in the meeting.
1097	No sense in offering something up if we don't know what the numbers look like, at least in a "ball park" sense.
1097	I should be able to get you something fairly concrete by end of day tomorrow or first thing Wednesday.
1097	That work?
1097	Have fun tomorrow.
1097	Best, Jeff
1098	That sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed.
1099	Attached is a very rough draft of solutions/messages for discussion at tomorrow's meeting.
1099	I'll bring hard copies to the meeting.
1100	Ok.
1100	Here they are.
1100	On exhibit A, I didn't touch numbers are exhibit #s.
1100	Also, I deleted CAPM, since we ain't got anything yet.
1100	And I deleted the part that said "ticket sales taxes don't matter much," because now that we have the numbers they could matter, cuz it's really tight between bond payments and tax revs.
1100	Anyway, that's it.
1100	I checked and doubled checked the numbers and exihibit #s in the exec sum, but you may want to give one last peek.
1100	Thanks SO much for pulling it together.
1100	Best, Jeff
1101	Hi Mary: Well, the problem is likely just that I'm dense.
1101	I log in, click on deferral and find a description of what one needs to do (i.e., fill out the form), but I've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form.
1101	Am I (probably) missing something?
1101	Thanks a bunch.
1101	Best, Jeff
1102	many thanks, mary.
1102	and michelle, i'm indebted, as always.
1102	if you don't hear from me, that means all went well.
1103	I'm on your man.
1103	What do you need?
1104	11 AM PST.
1104	I'll try to be on but can't promise.
1105	Can we have a quick call (i.e., no more than 30 minutes) at 9 AM (PST) on Monday to discuss?
1106	you getting this stuff?
1107	will be at both meetings and will have detailed proposals beforehand.
1107	we continue to work on procurement piece and have reached teh same conclusion as you in your note---need something to implement now, as well as a "longer" term solution to IOU procurement.
1107	you'll be hearing from me.
1108	yes, thank you.
1108	see you tonite!
1109	Folks: The "subcommittee" I've referenced that's trying to come up with a solution to California's train wreck is moving very quickly.
1109	The group's shooting to have a first cut at a "straw person" proposal sketched out by end of next week.
1109	The group's meeting on Tuesday to continue to bounce around ideas.
1109	I'd like to try to have an internal call on Monday at either 10 AM (PST) or 3 PM (PST) to pin down at least a vaguely detailed conceptual framework that I can propose to the subcommittee on Tuesday.
1109	The agenda items for the internal meeting are: Finalize proposal for benchmark(s) for utility procurement.
1109	Goal: increase utility willingness to enter into forward contracts by replacing PUC after-the-fact "reasonableness" review with a benchmark.
1109	(Been working the Portland desk on a "portfolio benchmark" concept.) Determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t.
1109	the PX credit, i.e., should those contracts be disclosed to the market, or should PUC keep them confidential, calculate the PX credit behind closed doors, and publish the credit ex poste?
1109	The PX credit depends on the overall utility portfolio, not just the PX price.
1109	Let me know if 10 AM or 3 PM (PST) works better.
1109	Harry: I'll assume that you'll contact the folks from EES that need to participate.
1109	Best, Jeff
1110	Mark: I don't know how any "concerns" I may have raised reached you, but rest assured that there are no worries from my end.
1110	I saw the piece on the local news.
1110	Vacar's on a one-person crusade to kill capitalism, that's certain.
1110	It was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context, and they did you a great disservice.
1110	Just between us chickens, it did come up as if you were implying that there's some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit.
1110	You can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue.
1110	But I don't think that you should sweat it.
1110	In a very brief conversation with Mike Day I mentioned the piece and that they got you responding to manipulation (i.e., "when'd you stop beating your wife) on camera. So agitated was I that I didn't even bother to bring it up with Herr Fawcett. So again, thanks much for the note, but no big deal. Now for my two cents: Question: "what's the problem?"
1110	answer: "very bad state energy policy---and here are the five big regulatory problems standing in the way of a solution for California....."
1110	"market manipulation?
1110	well, those charges are raised in every industry, whenever prices spike.
1110	the lion's share of the time, it turns out to be market fundamentals."
1110	Appreciate your note. Thanks. Jeff
1111	perhaps you were a little strong in relaying my concerns to someone?
1112	congratulations?
1112	condolences?
1112	anyway, let's talk.
1112	today's bad.
1112	you in tomorrow?
1113	Thanks very much Dave.
1113	We've got the proposal (and we've got a few issues with it).
1113	I know that you're swamped managing EES' book, etc. So I'd be happy to fill Dave in on EES' view of CLECA's proposal, the negotiations that are underway generally, and what we're cooking up to try to help the negotitations along.
1113	Just let me know.
1113	Also, Dave, be happy to talk to Hanson, and fill them in one what's going on out there if that would be useful.
1113	Jeff
1114	sorry for the delay.
1114	be great to catch up, but with all this energy mess, i've had to cancel going, unfortunately.
1114	hope you're well.
1114	Best, Jeff
1115	fyi.
1115	most responses back have been for 3 pm (from the traders).
1115	also, give dennis a call.
1115	he's polling folks to get views on what ferc's going to do on the 13th.
1115	best, jeff
1116	you bet.
1116	i'm at 415.782.7822.
1117	Thank you very much for the info.
1118	FYI.
1118	Per my voice message to you yesterday.
1119	Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment?
1119	With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters.
1119	With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the "next big investment opportunity for the coming decade."
1119	In Winters' 250 page report, "Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2," he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation.
1119	"Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's," said Winters.
1119	"Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power," added Winters.
1119	According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the "new" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation.
1119	He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile.
1119	"They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices," the analyst said.
1119	"Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity."
1119	Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements.
1119	The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well.
1119	In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback.
1119	In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies.
1119	He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a "buy" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as "attractive."
1119	The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows.
1119	Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral.
1120	Thanks very much for the info, Hedy.
1121	Folks: As you recall from out meeting on Tuesday, we decided that I'd pull together a brief description of our key priorities and the actions underway to achieve them.
1121	The status report will be updated weekly.
1121	We'll use the weekly update as an important internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in CA.
1121	It will also serve as a a tool to help identify the need to modify our priorities and/or actions in light of ever-changing circumstances.
1121	We were going to try to get the first report out this week, but with the meeting in Houston, Sue's doctor appt and Karen's meetings with Marathon, we'll get the first one out Monday.
1121	My notes suggest that (today's) key priorities---understanding that everything's subject to change on a daily basis---are: No refunds End wholesale price caps as soon as possible Get forward markets working in CA Expedite plant siting No early roll of/maintain the rate freeze (till ~01/02) Maintain current PX credit framework (till ~01/02) Please forward to me the actions underway and planned in the area for which you've been designated "lead."
1121	Given how fluid things are, It seems prudent to limit "planned" items to those we've got planned for the next 2-4 weeks.
1121	I'll compile for distribution by COB Monday.
1121	My notes show the following leads: Also please let me know if my notes w.r.t.
1121	leads is consistent with yours.
1121	Thanks very much and have a great weekend.
1121	Best, Jeff
1122	Rick, Jim, Harry: You will have the first status report for California by COB on Monday.
1122	We will update that report weekly.
1122	If there's anything you need between now and Monday, please let me know.
1122	Have a good weekend.
1122	Best, Jeff FYI: Yesterday, the California PUC rejected the utilities request to, among other things, raise rates and end the rate freeze.
1122	The status quo prevails, at least for now.
1123	Well, you two really raised the bar with that celebration.
1123	It was just fantastic.
1123	Prentice said it's the best birthday she's ever had.
1123	Thanks so much for everything.
1123	It was really neat.
1124	The votes have been counted (kidding), and the call will take place today at 3 PM PST.
1124	Call-in number to follow.
1125	Could you please set up a call and distribute to this list?
1125	Topic: utility forward contracting proposal.
1125	Time 3-4:30 pm PST.
1125	Thanks very much.
1126	Sounds very good.
1126	Might be useful to get a "reputable" economist to write a paper that 1) describes traditional means for defining, identifying and mitigating market power, 2) compares those with the "new" means folks are coming up with these days, and 3) comments on the "split" in the academic community over the issues.
1126	When Steve Kean and I discussed the notion initially, thought it might be a good idea to gently "pile on" to the public discussion with the goal of making clear 1) just how complex this issue is and 2) how important it will be to have a thorough analysis (say, about 12+ months worth?) before rushing to judgment on anything Joskow might allege in his paper.
1126	Thoughts?
1126	Best, Jeff
1127	I believe that on Thursday/Friday?
1127	you sent a note with some suggestions on proposed solutions.
1127	Darned if I can find it.
1127	Could you resend it?
1127	Or, in the flurry of activity, am I mistaken, and the last dispatch I got from you was the note you sent on the 6th?
1127	Apologies, Jeff
1128	I've been buried.
1128	What did we hear from FERC last week?
1128	Was that from Larcamp's their visit to Houston?
1129	I ain't forgot.
1129	Your proposal is a "touchy" one, and let's just say that it's required some nimble dancing in the attempt to gauge where folks sit, if you get my drift.
1129	I'm still on the case, however.
1130	who's on so far?
1131	Mon-Thurs: SF
1132	Mike: Please forward the letter to Jeff.
1132	Jeff, we'll be signing the letter.
1132	Look like something TW can sign.
1132	Give me a ring when you get a chance to look at it.
1132	Best, Jeff
1133	Given the messy spot that SDG&E in particular and SoCalGas find themselves in due to what's happened to gas prices at the Cal border, it might not be a bad time to check in with our friend Neil Schmally (sp?) at Sempra to see how Enron might help?
1134	In case folks haven't already heard through other sources, a reliable person told me that PG&E is hedged for core gas requirements: financial--for 45% of core volumes at prices "in the single digits/decatherm" physical--for 15% of core volumes (via storage) at prices "less than the financial hedge" SDG&E is naked.
1134	SoCalGas is likely in the same boat as SDG&E, or worse, since they optioned core's storage gas to noncore customers, and, those customers are exercising.
1135	You're a star.
1135	I owe ya.
1135	Next time you're in town, let me know in advance.
1135	Maybe we can have lunch or something.
1135	Hope all is well.
1135	Best, Jeff
1136	OK.
1136	You and I are the last ones to get the info....Here it is.
1137	Good luck.
1138	Only if it's not a bother.
1138	You're very sweet to forward along.
1138	You must feel GREAT being done!
1139	can't wait.
1140	Talked to Eric.
1140	He'll give Kari a ring and pass along message.
1140	Best, Jeff
1141	Paul: Here's additional info for the "curtailment" data that we're pulling together.
1141	Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on NYMEX monthly prices.
1141	So for example, based on November's forecast, the utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.
1141	When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual prices.
1141	If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the utility will increase January's price forecast by "just enough" to make up for the December undercollection.
1141	If prices were too high and there's an overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough to refund the overcollection.
1141	If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have generally spread out the "true-up" over several months to avoid "rate shock" one way or the other.
1141	However, under the current circumstances, the utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the entire undercollection in the following month.
1141	In short, there's at least a one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts versus actual.
1142	Refer such calls to Karen Denne in Houston.
1142	Thanks.
1143	I don't want to create an hassles.
1143	Don't feel like you have to get the thing all fixed up by Friday if it not's a cake walk.
1143	"Eldon Sellers" Please respond to eldon
1144	If all goes well, I'll have some info to distribute before the meeting regarding forward purchases.
1144	I'll be ready to discuss it at the meeting, too.
1145	Professor Berk: Very interesting to hear the perspectives of a South African ex-pat last evening.
1145	Today's been very hectic, but I'll get back to you on the possibility of having Enron sponsor internships for the financial engineering program.
1145	Until we've had a chance to talk, could you wait before forwarding my name along to anyone else in the fin eng group?
1145	Much appreciated.
1145	Best, Jeff
1146	Thanks---couldn't agree more on the "crisis here"/"need education" assessment.
1146	The more we educate folks, the more they agree with our views and positions.
1147	bed situation is as follows: everyone will be naked and in the same bed; your parents may excuse themselves if they wish.
1147	i'll be there round 7:30.
1148	That would work for me.
1148	And presumably Rory and Co. could come then, too?
1149	Can the deal bench presentation be distributed publicly?
1149	I'd like to use it in the "subcommittee" meetings I mentioned last week as a means to a solution for California's reasonableness review morass.
1149	Left a message with Kahn late last evening.
1149	Haven't heard back yet.
1149	Will let you know.
1149	Best, Jeff
1150	Frank's number at Luntz Research Companies is 703.358.0080.
1150	For video info, ask Steve Kean.
1151	Will do.
1152	But Rory (who by the way is responsible for this mess!) now has decided that he'd like to do a Xmas "make up" on the 29th, which is smack dab in the middle of when we'll be up at the dome (tween xmas and new year's--hopefully you and eldon will join us so we can kick yer butts in spades).
1152	so the 29th is very bad, as you can imagine.
1152	if we could do the 24th, that would be great.
1152	when's your plane leave on the 24th?
1153	do surf shops rent wet suits?
1153	you think i can rent one from live water?
1154	yes.
1154	do we have a call-in number yet?
1155	Jennifer: I got a call from Chris Bailey (sp?) needing a summary of California dereg for a presentation(s) that Harold's assembling.
1155	Attached is summary that Mona pulled together for Harold a couple of months ago.
1155	I don't have Chris' email address (I've left him a message).
1155	Could you forward this along to him?
1155	Thanks a bunch.
1155	Best, Jeff
1156	yep.
1157	Sean: 305.5160
1158	naked, all in one bed.
1158	star doesn't need a bed.
1158	prentice and i will need a bed (hey, it's her birthday!) tom & karen are very iffy, but if they show, and stay overnight (iffy times two), then they'll need a bed.
1158	that work?
1159	For today's noon call.
1159	when you open, answer "disable macros" to first prompt, and "no" to question about links.
1159	there are three portfolio scenarios that i'd be happy to discuss very quickly during the call.
1160	FYI.
1160	As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the "reasonable review" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.
1160	For that effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to devise a solution to California's melt down.
1160	The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.
1160	1) "do nothing" 2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the amount with 10-year fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed priced power.
1160	3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.
1160	The term of each scenario is 5 years.
1160	Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly equivalent for each of the three portfolios.
1160	However, the graph shows (as one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.
1160	The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if undertaken using a "DealBench-like" tool) ought to be "per se" reasonable.
1160	If anyone has questions about it, or would like to discuss further, give a call at 415.782.7822.
1160	Best, Jeff
1161	Agree that Enron shouldn't be the lead.
1161	An economist should be the lead with a broad group of folks funding.
1161	Seems funny that EPSA wouldn't have an interest in the debate over how market power is assessed and addressed.
1162	oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1162	In the "big" house, sleeps 10---3 kings and 2 twins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1162	In the "little" house, sleeps 6--2 queens and 1 trundle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1162	anything else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1163	Hi.
1163	Got your message.
1163	As you know, it's complete meltdown here, so I apologize for not having got back to you sooner.
1163	I'll read and get back to you.
1163	Deadline?
1164	Leslie: Looks good.
1164	Just a couple of comments: 1.
1164	General May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's "import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state infrastructure.
1164	California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 80-90 percent of its gas supply.
1164	California has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade.
1164	So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
1164	The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.
1164	Can we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?
1164	If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we need to propose ways to eliminate it?
1164	Otherwise, seems that we may be giving FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the right direction.
1164	Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.
1164	2.
1164	Specific Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.
1164	The midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.
1164	The Southwest (Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits the California border.
1165	But if they kept Grace, they might have a winning season, and lord knows nobody wants that....
1166	Thanks a bunch.
1166	So how in the world did you find yourself standing in front of this tornado?
1167	FYI.
1167	EPSA and IEP will have a joint PR call tomorrow in case anyone would like to listen in.
1168	He just can't help himself.
1169	thanks very much.
1170	math error.
1170	big sleeps 8.
1170	little sleeps.
1170	can you explain the panic about sleeping arrangements, and could you fill me in on what those arrangements are prior to sending the email out?
1171	Looks fine to me to send around.
1171	You want to send it?
1171	Give a call when you get a chance to discuss.
1172	That's the information that they sent me, copied from what they sent me.
1173	8 (big) 6 (little).
1173	i assume "trundle" sleeps two.
1174	Just met with the industry group trying to come up with a solution for California.
1174	The group liked our portfolio approach.
1174	In sum: A portfolio approach is the right long-term solution.
1174	In the short run, our illustrative portfolios show that the utilities ought to immediately fill a modest portion of their requirements via fixed-price, long term contracts, and those contracts should be found reasonable, up front, so long as the utility uses a competitive auction.
1174	To stimulate discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.
1174	Everyone on the call liked the proposal.
1174	After some discussion about whether 5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.
1174	(Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.) Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive.
1174	Thanks to everyone for the help in getting the proposal together, Steve Swain in particular.
1174	(Steve: We may get asked to run a few more illustrative portfolios for the group.) I'll report back on what happens at the meeting on Friday.
1174	If there are any questions, etc., just let me know.
1174	Best, Jeff
1175	Eve Elsesser AES--Aaron Thomas (retail) Munis Munis and Florio were not on the call today, but I suspect both will be OK with our proposal.
1176	As we discussed, attached is a brief description of ENA's and EES' key goals in California and the actions underway to achieve them.
1176	We'll update the status report weekly.
1176	We hope that the weekly update will serve as a useful internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in CA.
1176	It can also serve as a tool to help identify the need to modify our goals and/or actions as circumstances change.
1176	Comments on the form and/or substance of the document and how we can make it more useful are welcome.
1176	Best, Jeff
1177	Joseph will set up the call and distribute to the list.
1178	paul.
1178	please leave the number on paul's voicemail since he's traveling.
1178	thanks a billion.
1179	NRDC, TURN, Edison, Sempra, CLECA (large industrial), AES (formerly NEV), Munis, PX, CMA, Enron.
1179	Though TURN and Munis, while not opposed, are posturing at this point as "noncommittal."
1180	Hmmmm.
1180	The world is no longer safe, not even for we relics.
1180	Well, I'l glad to know that at least one adult is involved.
1181	yes, and we can discuss storage further if you like.
1182	Being a true blue American, I support expansion.
1182	If you get a free minute, can you give me a call to discuss.
1182	My short answer is--no problem, looks good.
1183	I'll get you my comments ASAP.
1183	Has Shelley Corman seen it?
1184	Kahn's secretary has left messages that he's "very tied up" and continues to try to contact me.
1184	Suggests to me that they may be planning something and he's reluctant to contact folks.
1184	I'll poke around.
1184	I thought our stock would go UP when an announcement about Skilling was made.
1184	I guess this means you'll be going to D.C. with Lay.
1185	I was thinking that you might be able to bring a modicum of legitimacy to it....
1186	I was thinking that I should probably get another case of coastal.
1186	1) What do you think?
1186	2) Could you have one delivered?
1186	I could pick it up.
1187	Going to be an ugly four years....
1188	FYI.
1188	I'm editing now and have several proposed edits.
1188	Should be to you within 20 minutes.
1189	Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a chainsaw to the otherwise good job.
1190	I'm thinking we need two cases.
1191	you got it.
1192	My pleasure.
1192	Thanks for the opportunity.
1192	Good luck.
1192	Between the US Supreme Court and the energy crisis, D.C. must be very interesting right about now.
1193	Word on the street is that Davis, Hoecker and Richardson are meeting in D.C. today.
1193	That consistent with what your hearing?
1194	I'm on the EPSA/IEP call but doing a million things simultaneously.
1194	Lynn's taking a big role on the call.
1194	I think that you should check in with her afterwards to get a briefing since I'll be getting off for another call in the next 5 minutes.
1195	please send the call-in number around for 1:30 call when you get.
1195	kaufman's going to be on the call.
1195	thanks, buddy.
1196	Mark: Did you have wind of Jason's story on Edison calling for an end to AB 1890?
1196	His spin on the story was good one---Edison got everything it wanted (out of 1890) and now it wants out of the contract.
1196	The story seems worthy of a response, particularly since Jason's the reporter.
1196	Even the Chair of FERC recognizes that going backwards is not the answer.
1196	Best, Jeff
1197	I'm available at 8 am (do while you're driving?) and will make my schedule flexible in the afternoon.
1198	That was painful.
1199	I feel so useless.
1199	Thanks so much for taking charge of this and doing such a fantastic job.
1199	Are you in close contact with Martin and Doug?
1200	Jeannie: Apologies.
1200	Though I'm sure it doesn't seem like it, I'm on the job.
1200	I'll try to get the numbers and I'll read the piece now.
1200	Best, Jeff
1201	I was told that Lynch and Duque released press releases today saying that the Commission does not intend to let the utilities to go bankrupt.
1201	Haven't been able to find any press releases on the CPUC website, however.
1202	Professor Aceves: Attached are a word and an excel file.
1202	Both are formatted for easy print out.
1202	Note that the excel file has two work sheets: "balance sheet" and "income statement."
1202	I'd be happy to provide you with a hard copy, too, if you would prefer a hard copy.
1202	Just let me know.
1202	Thanks for a great course.
1202	All the best, Jeff
1203	Might have perhaps been simpler if Bill "Al Haig" Richardson had announced at the press conference yesterday that he was ordering his energy company, BPA, to stop "withholding" and send power to California.
1204	Can you believe this?
1205	Ralph: No one else had any problems with it.
1205	It's a simply Excel file that should show graphs with 3 "portfolio scenarios."
1205	Would you like me to fax to you, or bring copies to tomorrow's meeting?
1206	Sue, Sandi, Paul: Let's try to discuss and collect any comments we have this afternoon at our weekly staff meeting.
1207	apologies.
1207	could you resend me the id and password to get into EOL.
1207	thanks a bunch.
1208	Professor Aceves: Could you let me know that you received the final exam files that I sent last nite?
1208	I'll sleep easier knowing that you've received them and that they're not floating around somewhere in cyberspace.
1208	Thanks very much.
1208	Best, Jeff
1209	Sorry.
1209	Been a bit crazy around here.
1209	Thanks for the note, and thank you for doing such a good job at driving this process.
1209	My thoughts on your proposal (and these are very preliminary): 1) politicians may not be willing to go as high as 25% for fear of being accused of a "utility bailout"--maybe 10-15%?
1209	though utility solvency may force their hands.
1209	2) TURN will go ape-#%#$ if we make the "roll off" retroactive to October.
1209	3) I'm willing to allow utilities to collect TRA undercollections, but feel that customers and utilities (not me) need to figure out precisely what that number is.
1209	Look forward to getting closure tomorrow, though I'm very concerned that we've lost Edison, given Bryson's public calls to return to 1950.
1209	Best, Jeff
1210	Actually, please keep doing this, but send them only to Miyung Buster and ask that they be included in the group of articles sent out to everyone twice a day.
1210	Miyung's in charge of compiling and distributing such articles on a twice-a-day basis.
1210	Thanks a bunch.
1211	Glad to hear that you're on the distribution.
1211	I think it's vital that you attend.
1211	It's a centrist group that's making a lot of progress.
1211	But chances for success will be greatly diminished without PG&E's participation.
1211	Best, Jeff
1212	P.S.
1212	If you're responsible for getting Dan there, you're a genius.
1212	I've written Dan a note telling him that it's absolutely critical that he be there.
1212	Maybe you could ask the other folks on the distribution to urge Dan to come, too.
1212	Best, Jeff
1213	Hi Kari: I know that you and I are both swamped, so I'm writing very briefly to give you a brief update.
1213	But first, thank you very much again for meeting last week.
1213	Greatly appreciated, and look forward to working together to help in any way I can to find solution that is acceptable to all.
1213	Here's the update: Our "subcommitte" is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a proposed solution.
1213	It focuses on 3 key areas: Using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices.
1213	Designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more appropriate balance in CA between state oversight and the need for utility flexibility.
1213	Rate stabilization/Undercollections (utility solvency) I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress.
1213	If thing's go according to plan, we may be in a position to submit something to you a early as Monday.
1213	If there's a deadline from your end that I ought to be aware of, let me know and I'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work plan.
1213	In the meantime, if there is anything at all that I can do to help, please don't hesitiate to contact me.
1213	Thanks again and all the best, Jeff
1214	who the hell is this bozo?
1215	you forward this to wolfe, belden & co.?
1216	I think we need to be careful about broadcasting every rumor floating around to an email list of this size.
1216	Just a thought.
1217	no problem.
1217	we're cancelling the meeting.
1218	FYI.
1218	Here's the release that I referenced yesterday evening.
1218	CONTACT: Armando Rend?n CPUC PRESIDENT LYNCH AND COMMISSIONER DUQUE STATEMENT California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Henry Duque today issued a statement regarding revisions to item 8 on the Commissioner agenda of December 21, 2000: We note certain revisions to the Commission's published agenda for December 21st.
1218	Item 8 has been revised to reflect the scope of options available to the Commission in addressing current financial conditions facing Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison.
1218	The financial problems faced by California's utilities are the result of the failure of the wholesale electric market to ensure just and reasonable prices for this necessity.
1218	The Commission need not act on this agenda item on December 21st, but the fact that it is on our agenda allows the Commission to act if necessary.
1218	The financial stability of California's utilities is of paramount importance to California, and to this Commission.
1218	The CPUC stands ready to act to protect the financial viability of California utilities.
1218	The exorbitant and unjustified prices now being charged in California's electricity market demonstrate the necessity for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to intervene and control the opportunism of the electricity sellers.
1218	FERC must act to solve the underlying market failure so that all energy consumers are assured of reliable delivery of power and protected from exorbitant energy costs.
1218	We urge FERC to act immediately.
1218	For information on this item, please contact Harriett Burt, Deputy Chief of Staff for Loretta Lynch at 415-703- 2444, Mary Lou Tousey, 415-703-2593, or Commissioner Carl Wood, 415-703- 2440.
1219	you will be on call, correct?
1220	Since I'm in S.F., I assume that I'll be able to call in by phone?
1221	Jeannie: there are currently 8,300 MWs worth of applications submitted and awaiting approval for construction from the CEC.
1222	get rid of him.
1223	And the same to you.
1223	Sorry you didn't make to have a beer after the final.
1223	See you at MPAR in January.
1223	Have fun catching up on your sleep and laying around a little bit.
1223	Best, Jeff
1224	Only the presidential election was more bizarre!
1224	I have my fingers crossed that a Republican administration will help.
1224	In any case, it's a welcome change of pace.
1224	Hope you're well out there.
1224	Best, Jeff
1225	Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.
1225	One general comment: It may be a bit lengthy at this point.
1225	Also, have we decided whether it would be our op-ed piece?
1225	And one key point that is very commercially sensitive: The term "end the rate freeze" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the timing of any such "end" in California.
1225	Thus my heavy-handed edits on that portion.
1225	Nice job, Jeannie.
1225	Best, Jeff
1226	Attached is a letter that we worked on today and that will be sent to the Governor, CA's US Senators (Boxer/Feinstein), congressional folks, and key Cal state legislators.
1226	It's going out first thing tomorrow AM.
1226	It builds on many of the things we've discussed over the past several months, so there shouldn't be any surprises.
1226	If you've got any concerns please give Paul a call at home or page me at 888.916.7184.
1226	Jeff
1227	Thank you.
1227	Have a nice holiday.
1227	Best, Jeff
1228	FYI.
1228	Please keep this internal and confidential.
1228	Here's where the group I mentioned left off last Friday.
1228	It will be useful for our discussion this afternoon.
1228	You'll note from the comments that it's anything but a done deal.
1228	I'll forward the SF press mentioned in the note.
1228	Best, Jeff
1229	Can we try to set up a quick call to discuss?
1230	1) Is it your sense that the deal is done and that it will be announced at the PUC meeting on Thursday?
1230	2) Would the PUC be required to provide 30 days comment, or could it be effective immediately?
1230	Best, Jeff
1231	Bad.
1231	Let's talk.
1232	Yes.
1233	need to be 12:30
1234	Mike: Can't thank you guys enough for coming.
1234	It was a great time, and Prentice was really happy that you made it.
1234	Hope you didn't get too much of a headache listening to me play (?) the bass.
1234	Please pass along thanks to Lisa, and no reciprocation needed.
1234	Great to have you.
1234	Happy holidays.
1234	Best, Jeff
1235	likely a mistake.
1235	send the sender an email and ask?
1236	Jennifer: With respect to FERC's ruling from Friday, I'll forward to you what's been forwarded to me.
1236	With respect to the governorn's plan, the one that you forwarded along from EES' customer is definitely one of the more extreme scenarios we've been hearing, but with Davis, I wouldn't rule anything out.
1236	If I hear anything, I'll report back.
1236	Best, Jeff
1237	The haircut notion, I believe, arises from Edison's claim that the PX price includes a capacity payment, particularly when demand (i.e., the price) is higher.
1237	I think there's discussion of it in the proposed decision that came out some time ago and which sits in "hold" limbo on the Commission's agenda.
1237	I've attached it.
1237	Alan could you see if it's included in the decision?
1237	If not, I can poke around more.
1237	Thanks.
1237	Best, Jeff
1238	Steve: Here's the info for tomorrow's call.
1238	Thanks for making the time.
1238	Talk to you then.
1238	Best, Jeff 12:00 CDT Call with Dick Anderson (EBS Tax), Steve Bowen and Dan Clearfield re: using a c-corp vs. an LLC for our CLEC
1239	FYI.
1239	Just learned that California's key small consumer group, TURN, will be sending a letter to the PUC saying that it would be a violation of due process to issue on Thursday the sorts of orders the PUC is comtemplating without first giving folks a chance to comment.
1240	Just got off the call with the California stakeholders.
1240	The group's trying to come up with a solution and today's call was a challenge.
1240	Edison threw new demands on the table that effectively ended any chance for a deal today.
1240	Appears that at this point that anything more than a 10% rate increase is out of the question politically for the Governor, and the utilities are very unhappy about it.
1240	Consumer groups are already balking publicly at the 10% increase reported in the press.
1240	The meeting effectively ended when Edison announced that, in response to New West turning back their customers, Edison plans to file a proposal with the Commission this week that would require all returning customers to pay the spot price for energy.
1240	The large customer groups blew their tops and that pretty much ended the call.
1240	The group agreed to meet again on Friday, after the PUC business meeting on Thursday.
1240	Best, Jeff
1241	Thanks for the effort.
1241	Not looking so great.
1241	We should keep plugging away, however.
1241	Trucks with bullhorns?
1241	Best, Jeff
1242	don't even worry about it.
1242	i didn't feel jumped on at all.
1242	the debate has turned about 100% political with very little rational economic thought present, unfortunately.
1243	Thanks.
1243	These are the portions of the deal that I've been highlighting as problematic for us with the settlement group for the past few weeks.
1243	The group knows that unless there's some compromise on these points in a way that directly addresses our concerns, we won't be signing anything.
1243	After yesterday's call, at which Edison blew the meeting up, there's no deal in sight in the immediate term.
1244	No thanks necessary.
1244	My pleasure.
1244	I'll report back with what happens this afternoon.
1244	Best, Jeff P.S.
1244	You run a damned good meeting.
1245	FYI.
1245	This article tracks well with the information we've thus far received and that I passed along on the call this morning.
1246	Bob: I want to let you know that I stand in awe of someone who has the balls to open for someone as talented as Dan B. It demonstrates that you're one talented guy yourself.
1246	Congratulations.
1246	Your show was great, and it was good to see you.
1246	Best of luck on the rest of the tour.
1246	Best, Jeff
1247	Thanks a million for the summary.
1247	In the flurry, I accidentally deleted it.
1247	Could you re-send.
1247	It's STILL a jungle out there.
1247	Best, Jeff
1248	I've been notified that the California Commissioner has cancelled the meeting with stakeholders that had been scheduled for this afternoon.
1248	He'd scheduled it to discuss what the order the Commission intends to issue on Thursday might look like.
1248	It signals, at this point, that the utilities continue to have a difficult time reaching agreement with the administration.
1248	Will get back with more as it develops.
1248	Jeff

1249	Do you have two now?
1249	Ditto on your comment re: the man versus him music.
1249	The personality is way, way out front.
1250	you bet.
1250	Helps a lot having you identify the interests.
1250	So please continue doing that.
1250	I'll keep you up on what's happening as it happens.
1251	Heres' the file.
1251	Again, we used it, in the end, to justify having the utilities go out, now, and fill 10-15% of their net short position with 5 and 10 years deals.
1251	The group agreed, though there's still discussions about the percentage (higher?) and the mix (5 and 10 year deals?; 3, 5, 10 year deals?)--you get the picture.
1251	The guy from Edison who's been participating in the talks and agreed with our approach (understanding that the percentage and baskets are still negotiable) is John Fielder, SVP of regulatory affairs.
1251	Good luck.
1251	Best, Jeff
1252	January 5th, not December 5th.
1252	I'm glad to see that someone besides me writes down the wrong date once in a while.
1253	I paged you yesterday with the info on size, construction start and in-service dates.
1253	You get it?
1254	Couple of very minor suggestions, and I filled in the online date for
1255	I don't have it.
1255	do you need it soon?
1256	sounds like you'll be getting a subpoena!

1258	FYI.
1259	I'll be out the week between Xmas and the New Year.
1260	thank you.
1260	that's it!
1261	Sorry about that.
1261	I don't think that I'm in on the 1 pm conference call.
1261	Best, Jeff
1262	Mark: Here's the info Size = 500 MW Purchase price = $42 MM (sold to Calpine) Permit status at time of sale = all permits had been obtained One note: while we had gas and electric interconnection agreements ready to execute, Calpine told us not to and they arranged those for themselves.
1262	If there's anything else that you need don't hesitate.
1262	Happy holidays.

1264	Paul Kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the Western Governor's Association "Energy Summit" that took place today.
1264	Paul will follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer.
1264	The governors issued the following recommendations: California should immediately implement FERC's order issued last Friday and aggressively pursue all available DSM and conservation opportunties.
1264	The Western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and implementing DSM and efficiency opportunities.
1264	Increase supply as soon as possible.
1264	FERC should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that price caps can cause in the industry.
1264	FERC should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the price spikes in the first week of December.
1264	Work with the Bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new administration is focused on the issue.
1264	Hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region-wide cap until California takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation (e.g., reforming regs governing utility forward contracts).

1265	FYI, I'm having gall bladder surgery from January 1 to February 1.
1266	Very interesting.
1266	Quick questions: 1) $100MM come out of our pockets?
1266	2) Could we "guarantee" 500 MWs?
1266	3) Would we identify and implement DSM at our customers' sites?

1267	The meeting starts at 10 AM PST.
1267	Many who have tried to use the link in the past have been unable to connect, but the PUC may have since worked the kinks out.
1267	I will be at the meeting and will report back via email.

1271	We will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the Commission takes tomorrow.
1271	The Commission meeting starts at 10 AM PST, but it's unclear when they will take up our issue.
1271	Since the press will likely have the place surrounded, they may decide to do that item first.
1271	We'll send out a notice with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information.
1271	Best, Jeff
1272	Will do.
1273	These folks will need to be added to the distribution list.
1273	Lysa/Joseph: it's going to be a bit wacky, because, as the note indicates, I'm not sure what time the call will be.
1273	Anywhere from about 11 AM to 2 PM PST.
1273	We'll need to keep the number of ports as unlimited as possible, because I have a feeling that the note indicating that there be a meeting will get around, perhaps globally.
1273	As soon as I know what time I'll want to have the call, I will notify Joseph, who will need to set up the call and distribute the info to the original list I sent around plus the names below.
1273	If you two have suggestions on how you'd like to handle, like Ross Perot, I'm all ears.
1273	Thanks so much for your help.
1273	Also, please make sure to add Vicki Sharpe and Michael Smith of EES on the list, too.

1274	S&P threatened publicly yesterday that unless the PUC acts decisively today to fix the utilities' cash flow issue, they will significantly downgrade California's IOUs.
1274	I assume that's in the WSJ article Rick referenced.
1274	As Rick said, more info to come in a few hours.
1275	From the most recent information we have, the most likely outcome appears to be the following: As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash flow/credit problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%).
1275	It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission.
1275	It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for considering and implementing a "rate stabilization" plan in Q1 2001.
1275	That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically between now and 2 PM PST.
1275	Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.
1275	Jeff
1276	will do.
1277	Steffes' call is FERC related.
1277	This one's CA PUC related.
1278	Mike (Smith): Since things will move pretty quickly from this point forward, we want to have a quick meeting to explore our legal options and how best to preserve them.
1278	We'd like to have a kickoff call after the daily 10 AM (CST ) call that Wanda Curry handles.
1278	Are you available after Wanda's call?
1278	Say 11 AM CST?
1278	Thanks.

1290	That's a very good point.
1290	I'll make the change.
1290	Best, Jeff
1291	You're right, Sue.
1291	Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.
1291	Thanks very much for the comments.
1291	Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned and based on facts and evidence.
1291	Will make that change.
1292	you were on the original.
1292	did you not get it?
1293	Thanks.
1293	Good points.

1293	You have a great holiday with your family and a safe and happy New Year.
1293	Best, Jeff
1294	Thanks Roger.
1294	Here are the highlights of today's hearings: Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much.
1294	Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary.
1294	Due process matters.
1294	If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law suits will ensue.
1294	Don't jump the gun.
1294	A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities' proposals.
1294	The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets.
1294	However, as expected, the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.
1294	The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4.
1294	No more divestiture.
1294	The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all customers.
1294	One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities' hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation.
1294	Treat all customers equally and fairly.
1294	The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v. small; direct access v. bundled).
1294	No customer group should be sacrificied to save another.
1294	Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.
1294	As such, the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate problem.
1294	A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission should do no more.
1294	At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze.
1294	It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly.
1294	A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.
1294	But they were the exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.
1294	2.
1294	Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue through Friday.
1294	Tomorrow, lawyers will provide "oral" arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.
1294	We will argue that it does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 01.04.01.
1294	We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed.
1294	We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach.
1294	In terms of legal arguments, this is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking.
1294	After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and "all interested persons" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo).
1294	When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments, the President of the Commission responded "we don't know, it's evolving."
1294	In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is "appeal-proof."
1294	Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.
1294	We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side.
1294	We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.
1294	We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.
1294	Best, Jeff
1295	Here is some info in advance of tomorrow's call.
1296	will do.
1297	will do.
1298	I haven't received anything.
1299	ah jeez, i guess this means that you made it back safely from s.d?
1300	Today's hearing was dominated by : 1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the "rate freeze" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and, 1) an appearance by Ralph Nader.
1300	The Legal Issue In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction.
1300	Whether it sticks remains to be seen, however.
1300	We proposed that: The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate freeze issue.
1300	The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have provided the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied to the rate freeze.
1300	And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law suits, which is in no one's best interest.
1300	For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the utilities' access to capital markets.
1300	(We've taken no position on whether there's a need to raise rates.) setting a hearing schedule to examine the "rate freeze" and all related issues thoroughly and methodically.
1300	The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to attack in the courts.
1300	(In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs. Under the rate freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate freeze.) In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to raise rates if it found it necessary to do so.
1300	Many other parties agreed with our position.
1300	A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a call.
1300	During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the rate freeze issues.
1300	The Ralph Factor Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still looking for work.
1300	He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy news conference.
1300	From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and willing to bail the utilities out.
1300	Even when thrown some soft balls about "out of state generators," Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the utilities.
1300	But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have said things that I missed.
1300	The Next Steps The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week.
1300	Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial hardship.
1300	Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as does the PUC).
1300	The utilities will also have the chance to question the consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the Commission.
1300	On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should shoulder.
1300	More tomorrow on the call.
1300	Best, Jeff
1301	All: Please see attached materials from Steve Kean.
1301	Ken Lay and Steve Kean met yesterday with the Governor of California and his policy director to discuss solutions to California's energy problems.
1301	The meeting was very constructive.
1301	Ken Lay and Steve offered some of Enron's proposed solutions and the Governor discussed the options he's considering.
1301	We've been asked to provide--by Tuesday--feedback on his proposals.
1301	The turn-around time is tight, particularly in light of the holiday.
1301	We'll need your feedback by COB Monday.
1301	If at all possible, if folks can group their feedback, comments and suggestions and foward them along to me, that would be very helpful.
1301	If there is anyone else that you think ought to receive this information, please forward along.
1301	Thanks very much for you help.
1301	Best, Jeff
1302	Thanks.
1303	The Hearings The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility witnesses.
1303	The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
1303	The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices since restructuring started in 1998.
1303	Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and parent's use of that cash for investment activities).
1303	Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from parent, bankruptcy).
1303	The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings progress.
1303	Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by Edison witness.
1303	Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to issue its decision on Thursday.
1303	At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general ratemaking authority.
1303	Outside the Hearing Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management continue.
1303	Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
1303	Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any rate increases.
1303	Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of the state speech on the 8th.
1304	Thanks for the articles.
1304	Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home, which is some consolation.
1304	PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.
1304	Our exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.
1304	I can find out first thing Tuesday morning.
1304	And a very happy and safe new year to you, too.
1304	Best, Jeff
1305	Steve: I'm going to give you a call.
1305	Few things: Got your message.
1305	As you'll see from the document, I likely spent too much time over the weekend on the "what's in it for consumers" messages.
1305	Since it was one of the the "to do" items, I figured that it should get some emphasis, but sounds like that may not be the case.
1305	I've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the Gov's specific proposals, using direct investment in power plants by the state as the illustrative example.
1305	Let me know if you think it works.
1305	I have ideas on each, but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks before filling out our comments in each area.
1305	I'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the Gov might use "energy gurus" to help on the portfolio/procurment issues, and am also offering additional detail on the need for a "rate summit."
1305	Got messages in to Schroeder re: Nordpool--expect to hear back from him today at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it.
1305	Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.
1305	If you'd like to join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which I think you may already have in your email.
1305	Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.
1305	Best, Jeff
1306	Yes, have talked to both Stoness and Sunde about it.
1306	Thanks.
1307	Another Utility Bailout Should Leave Us Cold George Miller Sunday, December 31, 2000 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious.
1307	But before the governor and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more.
1307	Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition.
1307	But this will not happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders.
1307	The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition out of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every bad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities.
1307	Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities themselves.
1307	Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize the losses.
1307	Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from federal deregulation efforts.
1307	They argued that the deal they cut was good for all parties.
1307	Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit from the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them if wholesale prices were to go up.
1307	This, they told us, is the marketplace.
1307	They were willing to absorb the risk.
1307	This was the brave new world of free markets.
1307	But markets are never free.
1307	From the beginning, this deregulation plan was designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage.
1307	Initially, consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five years.
1307	Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets.
1307	At first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's risks.
1307	Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test.
1307	Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a substantial rate increase.
1307	The rationale is that the utilities may collapse financially.
1307	This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures.
1307	During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America.
1307	PG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T, it may be worth something to its competitors.
1307	This is the genius of the American marketplace.
1307	PG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk.
1307	Why should the ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk?
1307	During this past year, tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various Silicon Valley high-tech firms.
1307	Their shareholders do not get the benefit of going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout.
1307	The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that utilities struck with the people of the state of California.
1307	Any additional payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout.
1307	Any prudent investor would ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars.
1307	The ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration.
1307	George Miller is a Democratic congressman from Martinez.
1308	Thanks.
1308	I was literally just about to call the Portland desk.
1308	You saved me the trouble.
1308	Did they say whether they have any plans to cut PG&E off (from gas sales) in the near future?
1309	Thanks.
1309	Was aware of the power/gas split, but FYI, Chris Foster on the Portland desk is a great source of information--Midmarket electricity trader and a very straightforward guy.
1310	It could certainly use some doctoring, but it's getting there.
1310	I'm now shifting my focus to the "informal advisory group" on procurement.
1311	In office all week.
1312	Lamentably, I worked all week--no vacation time.
1312	Thanks.
1313	Thanks again for a truly fun New Year's.
1313	I had a great time, and it was fun spending it with you two.
1313	When I think of all that talent, together in one house---astounding!
1313	Really fun.

1315	The only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing comments on the Governor's specific proposals.
1315	That will likely go first thing tomorrow morning.
1315	You'll note that only one of the Governor's proposals currently has any comments attached to it.
1315	Comments on the Governor's proposals are appreciated.
1315	The remainder of the materials will go to the Governor's staff later this evening; so any and all comments on those portions are welcomed and appreciated.
1315	Thanks to all for the assistance, particularly in light of the holiday.
1315	Best, Jeff
1316	are you not getting the stuff.
1316	is there another paul smith?
1317	I haven't forgotten the QF issues.
1317	Going to weave them into our comments on the Governor's proposals.
1318	Thanks for the input.
1319	Scott: Thanks very much for the comments.
1319	On the demand buy-down, I should have mentioned that I got a late call from the Gov's office asking for more detail on that proposal, which we'll likely forward along tomorrow morning, with the comments on the Gov's proposals.
1319	Will try to work the other comments in. Thanks again.
1319	Best, Jeff
1320	let me know if you get it this time.
1321	Thanks.
1321	I think it makes sense to take out the reference to 15%.
1321	It think the rest of it passes the "front page of the New York Times test," as the PR folks say.
1321	Thanks again for your help on this.
1321	Best, Jeff
1322	Greetings Kari: Attached is follow-up information from the meeting that the Governor and you had with Ken Lay and Steve Kean last Thursday.
1322	Tomorrow morning I will email three additional pieces of information: Our specific comments on the proposals that the Governor raised at the meeting.
1322	More details on the "demand buy-down" concept.
1322	Information on Norway's version of the ISO, "Nord Pool."
1322	If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.
1322	Happy New Year.
1322	Best, Jeff
1323	At least there's some consistency in the world.....
1324	how's the memo coming?
1325	This is material that I received re: Nord Pool from Davies (one of Schroeder's guys).
1325	If you want to take a wack at putting together a few bullets on what Nord Pool is, how it differs from Cal model and why it's preferable, that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1) comments to Gov's proposal and 2) more detail on demand buy-down.
1325	That possible?
1325	Let me know.
1325	Greatly appreciated.
1325	Best, Jeff
1326	Joseph: please forward this to Scott Govenar and let him know that it's confidential and that some additional information will be going to the Govenor this morning, which I'll forward along when it's ready.
1326	Thanks very much.
1326	Best, Jeff
1327	The Commission closed the hearings last night at 7 PM.
1327	The Commission refused all attempts by the utilities'--and there were several--to get information on "ending the rate freeze" into the hearing record.
1327	The Commission is attempting to get a draft decision out at 10 AM today (PST).
1327	If it gets out, there will be oral argument at 12:30 today (PST), with final decision issued tomorrow at the Commission's regularly scheduled business meeting.
1327	If it does not get out, there will be no oral argument, and the Commission will issue its final decision tomorrow at its regularly scheduled business meeting.
1327	Anything could happen but it appears at this point that the decision will only address the need for a rate increase (rumors flyling furiously regarding how high the increase will be), with "rate freeze" issues put off for another day in the near future.
1327	Yesterday, the Governor of California joined Edison's suit against FERC calling for region-wide, hard price caps.
1328	FYI: From PUC Website: The California Public Utilities Commission intends to issue a proposed decision in A.00-11-038/A.00-11-056/A.00-10-028?
1328	by 11:00 AM (PST) today.
1328	The Proposed Decision will be e-mailed to the service list and published on the Commission's website ( simultaneously.
1329	Here they are.
1329	Please review and provide comments quickly.
1329	I'd like to get this off to Kari ASAP.
1329	Thanks.
1329	Jeff
1330	Final oral argument in A.00-11-038/A.00-11-056/A.00-10-028 is scheduled for 1:00 - 3:30 this afternoon in the Commission's auditorium at 505 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco.
1330	?
1330	The Commission will broadcast the final oral argument via phone bridge at 877-918-3008, password is 92105.
1331	I've had to spend a little time negotiating this AM with ENA and EES, but I'm confident that they'll be OK with this version.
1332	Shooting to get you the balance of the info by noon.
1332	Glad to hear it's useful.
1332	Hang in there.
1332	Best, Jeff
1333	Copy of order to follow.
1333	Here's a quick summary.
1333	Does not look great for the utilities.
1333	More to follow.
1333	one cent/kwh charge for all customers--equals 9% for rez, 7% for small biz, 12% for med commercial, 15% for large commercial and industrial only in place for 90 days Adopts TURN proposal for netting undercollection (from rate freeze) against overcollection (for CTC) Hearings begin next Wednesday (01.10.01) to begin address all remaining issues (including whether rate freeze has ended and when) and to set up a timetable to examine the results of the auditor's report
1334	Here's a copy of the draft.
1335	Thanks.
1335	Kari just wrote me an email expressing great appreciation for the materials.
1335	I told her that the rest will follow in the next hour.
1335	You're about to get from me the details on the buy-down proposal.
1335	I don't think that the bankers or the capital markets are going to swallow what Loretta Lynch issued today.
1336	Will do.
1336	That glitch in his email address has truly been my nemesis throughout.
1337	I apologize.
1337	I thought that had been taken care of.
1337	I'll take care of it.
1338	If it's any indication, Edison was down 2.75 today.
1338	Not pretty.
1339	you get the 5-year block numbers from Bob?
1340	Hi Sue: A very happy new year to you.
1340	Mr Kean has had me underwater since last Thursday night, but I'll resurface tomorrow, at which time we can catch up on a number of things, including bills.
1340	But I wanted to forward along Steve's memo that we discussed just prior to Xmas.
1340	Hope you had a great holiday and that all is well.
1340	Best, Jeff
1341	Greetings Kari: Forgive the delay.
1341	Much going on today, PUC draft decision in particular.
1341	The draft does not look promising for the utilities' financial position.
1341	Attached are our comments on the Governor's Proposals and some more detail on the demand-reduction proposal.
1341	We continue to work on the Nord Pool research for you and will turn that around as quickly as we can.
1341	Again, don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything else I can help with, or if there's anything else that you need.
1341	(415.782.7822) Best, Jeff
1342	California Electricity Update
1343	two questions: 1) are we having a staff meeting tomorrow?
1343	2) why the heck aren't you in the bonus meeting?
1344	I forwarded this to you so that you could have a chance to take a peek at it before forwarding along to the rest of the group.
1344	If you'd like me to forward it along to the larger group, just let me know.
1344	Jeff
1345	FYI.
1345	When I sent Kari Dohn some additional materials today, I mentioned in passing that I thought the Commission's draft decision fell short.
1345	She responded by asking why.
1345	Attached is my response, and hers.
1345	Perhaps there's a glimmer of hope for the IOUs between now and tomorrow.
1345	Best, Jeff
1346	Here's what we've delivered to Davis: Message points on the "big picture" Reasons that the Governor needs to broaden his information network (i.e., get better advice) and a proposal for how to do it Comments on the Governor's proposals Detail on how to execute the "buy-down" proposal 7X24, Peak and Off peak prices for 5-year blocks of power The only thing left to send is the Nord Pool material, which Jim Steffes is help me to gather for delivery tomorrow.
1346	Best, Jeff
1347	Best of luck.
1347	You've got a tough job.
1347	Guess you'll be working that much harder now that John Stevens is on his way to San Francisco.
1347	At last week's meeting, a request was made for peak and off peak prices.
1347	I've attached prices that we filed yesterday at FERC as part of its on-going proceeding of forward contracts.
1347	Few comments: We'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential, particularly since the information is covered by FERC's confidentiality provisions.
1347	Since we are not a "generator," we buy and sell in the market, which as you know is currently very volatile.
1347	Consequently, the quotes that we provide customers change daily to reflect changing market prices.
1347	These prices were put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were down today.
1347	So quotes we made today were lower.
1347	And quotes we makes tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be different from today's.
1347	Because these quotes were assembled yesterday, they are only "indicative."
1347	That is, if someone wanted to buy these products today, we'd have to recalculate prices, because the quotes established yesterday are no longer valid (for the reasons I mentioned above).
1347	Hope this helps.
1347	If you have any questions, let me know.
1347	Best, Jeff
1348	Attached are the final versions of confidential materials provided to the Governor's office.
1348	Best, Jeff
1349	Hi Sue: Hope all is well in the land of forward contracts.
1349	Do we know who the speakers are?
1349	Is Dave Parquet attending for us?
1349	Thanks.
1349	Jeff
1350	Greetings: Well, hope your holiday was great, because I'm back with more questions.
1350	To change my direct deposit account, can I do that on line, or do I need to do it by other means?
1350	Thanks, as always, and I hope you have a great 2001.
1350	Best, Jeff
1351	As you can imagine, the distribution list has almost reached the size of the entire company.
1351	If you folks could distribute materials to those in your group that need it, that would really help out a lot.
1351	Let me know if that works.
1351	Best, Jeff
1352	This touches the issues you and I discussed yesterday.
1352	Seems important to have this sort of information flowing well in advance of the activity.
1352	Have you or anyone else had a chance to peek at what Sam intends to present to legislators?
1352	The more the right is aware of the left hand, and vice versa, seems the better off we'll be.
1352	No big deal, but if we get our internal process in order at the outset, likely make it easier when the missiles really start flying.
1352	Your pal, Jeff
1353	EES' receivables related to PX-credit payments that PG&E continues to withhold has grown dramatically EES is going to meet internally to re-visit the issue of putting customers back on utility service (but honoring the financial terms of our contracts) They will try to convene a meeting, as early as Tuesday to discuss the switch-back issue w/Steve, Mark, Blachman, Sunde, etc., similar to the meeting held a couple of weeks ago Given the market's negative response to the Commission's decision, EES will immediately try to tie up bankruptcy counsel in anticipation of the fact that the utilities may be forced to file, which EES estimates will occur by end of next week, if it happens
1354	Jennifer: I will unfortunately not be able to make the call because I have to be at the California PUC for the decision that they're issuing today.
1354	Harry Kingerski, in Houston, might be able to join, though.
1355	The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared yesterday.
1355	Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the entire "rate freeze" structure remains intact for now).
1355	The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's "netting out" of gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
1355	The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.
1355	They will submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
1355	On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the utilties' power purchase costs.
1355	This action has reportedly been the result of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs credit worthy and solvent.
1355	As a result of those wires stories, the utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).
1355	We're working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in California, to get more info and will report back.
1355	The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.
1355	Only FERC was demonized more.
1355	Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent "interim" appointee, made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
1355	The Commission left open the possibility of "doing more" at their next meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue.
1355	And if an agreement is reached, it could end up on the next agenda.
1356	Yes, I'll get to Mike Day.
1357	you're a goddess.
1357	thank you.
1358	Vicki: Do we need to add the PX letter to the agenda for tomorrow's 10 AM call?
1358	If so, make sense to have Bracewell (Ron Carroll?) and Mike Day on as well?
1358	Jeff
1359	Ron Carrol works at Bracewell and he handles a lot of our FERC-related PX and ISO activity, including tariff activity.
1359	Ron works for Dan Watkiss, who also handles a lot of that work for us .
1360	Man, you ain't kiddin'.
1360	Jeez.....
1361	Greetings, Kari.
1361	Today's installment includes: Background on Nord Pool Information on the status of de-regulation in Pennsylvania.
1361	The rumors regarding securitization of utilities' power purchase costs had a very positive effect on the utilities' stock today.
1361	Congratulations.
1361	Theris conflicting information floating around, though.
1361	Some wires stories say that a state senator will sponsor a securitizationbill.
1361	Others say that it will be the Governor's bill.
1361	Is securitizationlegislation something that the Governor intends to sponsor/support?
1361	Though there are clearly some challenges to securitization, we think it offers a promising option.
1361	Hope the information is useful.
1361	Best, Jeff
1362	I sent Kari Dohn some more information today--thanks, Jim, for the Pennsylvania info.
1362	In the note, I asked her if the rumors about securitization are true, and whether the Governor, indeed, intends to push it actively.
1362	I also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option, particularly if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities.
1362	The response from Kari is very encouraging, and will hopefully help the utilities' credit position, though I heard PG&E was downgraded to junk by at least one credit agency today, but haven't confirmed it.
1362	Think it's prudent to keep Kari's info very close to the vest--here's Kari'her response: Jeff -- thank you so much for the information!
1362	Re: securitization, I don't think the exact form has been decided in terms of legislation, but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the highest level regarding the best way to do this (with good support, between us, it appears).
1362	All major parties will need to be supportive.
1363	I hear you.
1363	Feels like I haven't slept for about a week.
1363	Congratulations--securitization would be an extremely constructive outcome.
1363	If there's anything at all that we can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask.
1363	(Since folks view us as, well, somewhat controversial, we continue to try to do productive things away from the spot light.) Talk to you soon.
1363	Best, Jeff
1364	Hmmm, sounds like the pressure's getting to Mike a bit.
1364	A vacation might help.
1364	I think you're entitled to continue on, if that's your decision.
1364	You may not have the attendance you prefer, but I don't oppose moving the Gas Accord talks forward.
1364	Jeff
1365	Greetings: Thanks for all the help with information.
1365	Here's what we've sent to the Governor.
1365	Best, Jeff
1366	You ain't kiddin'.
1367	Mike: This should offer a guide to developing legislation that narrows PUC review of utility purchases to approval of the competitive solicitation used by the utility to procure the contracts.
1367	We have consistently argued against being prescriptive (i.e., the contracts should be of 3 years long, less than $60/MWH, etc.)
1368	Thanks.
1368	I'll touch base withJulee at IEP.
1369	Thanks, Harry.
1369	I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.
1369	Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing "credit receivables" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing conference on Wednesday.
1369	Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.
1369	But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron meters.
1369	Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the "complex process" of changing-out the meters.
1369	In addition, when CA border gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.
1369	SoCalGas submitted an emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.
1369	It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.
1369	Otherwise, we may find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of EES' exposure.
1369	Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned negative on ESPs as a result.
1369	Best, Jeff
1370	Greetings and Happy New Year to you both.
1370	Eve: Has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago?
1370	If so, I'm very interested in hearing about what's going on.
1370	If the group is going to meet between now and the 16th, I'm also very interested in participating in those meetings.
1370	Delaney, I'll be attending the meeting on the 16th.
1370	The Angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what we need, more David Freeman.......
1370	Best to you and yours in the New Year.
1370	Jeff "Delaney Hunter" Please respond to dhunter
1371	Sounds like a good idea.
1372	It might be a good idea to have a conference call to discuss the state treasurer's proposal released last Friday.
1372	A summary is attached.
1372	If folks agree that a call would be useful, does Noon PST (on Monday) work?
1372	Best, Jeff
1373	FYI.
1373	More info to follow.
1373	I'll give you a ring (tomorrow).
1373	Best, Jeff
1374	Thanks again.
1374	Apologies for bothering you over the weekend.
1374	Best, Jeff Please respond to stevebowen cc: Subject: CPUC affiliate entity jurisdiction PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION Jeff, Per your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our telephone conversation today.
1374	As we discussed, Enron plans to change the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C corporation to an LLC.
1374	As we discussed previously, this change in structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of the Public Utilities Code.
1374	You indicated that someone inside Enron was concerned that, during the course of the CPUC,s review of the request for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax returns of ETI,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would find unattractive.
1374	You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.
1374	At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.
1374	Depending on the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this jurisdiction.
1374	However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking to acquire control of the carrier.
1374	For nondominant telecommunications carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch, because such carriers have no market power.
1374	You should also be aware that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's financial information from public disclosure.
1374	Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.
1374	ETI is a nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of ETI, because EBS will still be ETI,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC, rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management personnel of ETI.
1374	The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.
1374	While this logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.
1374	Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss further.
1375	FYI.
1375	It's been reported that the legislative committee intends to subpoena generators and marketers to testify before the committe, though nothing in this press release mentions any subpoenas.
1375	Jeff
1376	Attached are my updates to Steve's backgrounder and solutions documents.
1376	I've also attached (for Rick) the summary of the CA State Treasurer's proposal.
1376	Best, Jeff
1377	FYI.
1377	See comments on keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy and timing.
1377	Jeff
1378	You've got my vote.
1379	FYI.
1379	Today Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, publicly opposed the "state takeover" plan released by California's Treasurer last Friday, saying, "I'm not a great fan of government getting involved in the private sector, especially delivering a key commodity to the private sector."
1379	(SF Chronicle, 01.09.01) Might be a good opportunity to try in earnest to enlist Silicon Valley in our efforts to get California moving in the right direction, despite itself.
1379	Barrett said the answer is easing siting rules in order to get more power on line sooner and blamed officials who've opposed power plants for seriously exacerbating the problems in California.
1379	Because of CA' power woes, Barrett said that he'd build new facilities anywhere but in California.
1379	Jeff
1380	Thanks, Ginger.
1380	I'll be on the call.
1380	Rick, if your schedule permits, could you participate in the first five-ten minutes of the daily EES call (10 AM CST) to give those folks a brief snapshot of what happened?
1380	If so the call-in number is 800.713.8600, code Alternatively, since I'll be on the call anyway, you can leave me a voicemail, or call me at 707.884.4608, and I can relay those points that you feel are most important to communicate.
1380	Best, Jeff
1381	Thanks, Sandi.
1381	Are the R's generally on-board with Davis' approach, or do they intend to offer their own proposals (understanding that they are greatly outnumbered in both houses).
1381	I'm hearing that it's a mixed bag.
1381	Best, Jeff
1382	I'll do my darnedest.
1382	Is Jan handling this poorly or well?
1383	Thanks, Mike.
1383	About the best we can hope for at this point and consistent with our approach.
1383	Would be very beneficial if we could ride as much as possible in TURN's public wake, and continue to "advise" them and work with others behind the scenes.
1384	Hey buddy.
1384	I know that you're up in Sacramento and have a much better lay of the land than I, but this looks a like a sure fire set up for "the man for all seasons" to make an appearance before the legislature.
1384	I have deep concerns about us sticking our necks out at these hearings.
1384	Again, have much better info, but by all accounts, "witch hunt" seems to be the operative term for the hearings.
1384	We are doing very well for ourselves working behind the scenes and the risks to us of having someone at a public leg hearing, with all the cameras, and all the politicians feeling the primordial urge to grandstand are very high.
1384	Let's please discuss this one long and hard before making an decision.
1384	I'll be in Sac on the 16th for an AB 1890 Group meeting and plan to attend the hearing.
1384	Your pal, Jeff
1385	Thanks, Julee.
1385	Sounds like a good idea.
1385	Could you please forward me the call-in for the call?
1385	Thanks.
1385	Best, Jeff
1386	Thanks.
1386	Any way to observe remotely?
1386	CSPAN?
1386	Telephone?
1386	Internet?
1386	From a cafe in Paris?
1386	Thanks.
1386	Best, Jeff
1387	Harry, I'll be on the call and I'll call you beforehand.
1387	Mike Day has every financial incentive for us to have a witness, and I'm still struggling to find the value.
1387	As for the "save the planet" crew....I'm as concerned as you are.
1387	I'll try to make sure that Kaufman's on (who's a lawyer and is considerably more to our thinking than to Mike's, Roger's or Stoness'. Best, Jeff
1388	Sorry to hear that it was cancelled.
1388	Thank you for keeping me in the loop.
1388	Quite a way to start the new year....
1388	Best, Jeff
1389	PG&E is saying publicly (and the news is reporting) that PG&E has $500 million in cash, and it's payables are $583 M.
1390	Don't mean to keep the chain of emails going, but given the cameras and the grand-standing politicians (who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and capacity for scape-goating, and a paucity of constructive solutions or the will necessary to do what needs to be done), seems worth considering the pros and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees.
1390	We may decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in California and the West, but seems worth spending 5 or 10 minutes on.
1390	Best, Jeff
1391	Scott: Could you please see that Sandi gets this?
1391	Thanks.
1391	If folks would like to get Sandi information (e.g., the load curtailment proposal discussed by Gary yesterday), please send to Scott, who's with our lobbying firm in Sacramento.
1391	Sandi, Scott (Stoness) would like to discuss this proposal on tomorrow's (Friday's) 8:00 AM conference call.
1391	Thank you.
1391	Best, Jeff
1392	Thanks, Karen.
1392	And please thank Marathon for the info.
1392	If this holds true, sounds like Burton plans to make things pretty messy.
1393	also, diablo is also running (reportedly) at about 10% of capacity due to rough seas and difficulties that causes for cooling.
1394	Not the retained assets case---Wood wants to cap prices to QFs.
1394	Jeanne, could you try to get any information you can from PUC staff on how they intend to handle PG&E's advice letter re: "we've stopped selling power from out retained assets into the PX?"
1394	(I'm assuming that the PUC would be sympathetic, since it should immediately lower the utility's bill for power?) Thanks very much, Jeff
1395	The playboy mansion?
1396	Greetings Mark: Any interest?
1396	Best, Jeff
1397	Yes, the utilities can pass through the gas costs.
1397	They face an "incentive ratemaking mechanism" that includes a "market benchmarket" that they must meet or beat.
1397	The benchmark's a composite of spot indeces.
1397	So as long as they buy spot, they can meet the benchmark and pass everything through.
1397	(Ill-conceived procurement incentive, particularly in these days when prices are going north, but at least there's no price cap creating gas undercollections like there is on the electric side.) If you need anything else, just holler.
1397	Jeff
1398	Sort of a single-minded focus.
1399	Harry: Tamara Johnson left me a voicemail stating that 1) she phoned Bob Weisenmiller requesting that he be our witness 2) there was disagreement internally about whether Enron should have testimony 3) she nonetheless wanted to try to make sure Bob was available and 4) she would call Bob back to discuss further on Tuesday.
1399	Not sure that this is the best way to run a railroad.
1399	As you mentioned, it's quite inefficient to have EES folks contacting our lawyers and reg consultants directly.
1399	I did not respond to Tamara's message--thought it would be better to pass along info to you.
1399	We can discuss further on Tuesday.
1399	Best, Jeff
1400	FYI.
1400	Report from California's IPP trade association.
1401	Of course, I'd love to hear that I made if off the waiting list.
1401	Could it be true?
1401	Could you let me know.
1401	Thanks.
1401	Best, Jeff
1402	Mike: Could you please forward a copy of the document listed below to Ms Cantrell?
1402	Thanks very much.
1402	Best, Jeff
1403	Greetings: See attached "meeting notice."
1403	This could be a good opportunity to get our demand-side proposal on the table.
1403	Dennis: If we could get some power point slides together, we could present our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.
1403	Let me know your thoughts.
1403	Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today.
1403	Please pass this along to others who might be interested.
1403	Thanks.
1403	Jeff
1404	likely to go up, but whether it goes up by enough is unclear.
1404	They've got a very long way to go if they hope to keep the IOUs from filing Chapter 11.
1405	i'll give you a call today.
1406	you're alive.
1406	thank god.
1406	i was wondering.
1406	be great if you would call some time so that we could guffaw about all of this.
1406	it is rich.
1406	very rich.
1406	415.782.7822.
1406	hope that you and yours are well.
1406	that should have listened to us.
1406	(hee hee) best,
1407	I agree with Harry.
1407	In particular, we'll need to make Richard Sanders and ENA's outside counsel are aware.
1407	I have been concerned, and continued to be concerned about, the implications of being in the case, understanding that our interests--and the stakes--are very high.
1407	Continues to seem important that we be in, but we'll need to discuss further, and make sure that Jim and ENA's attorney's are in the loop.
1407	Best, Jeff
1408	Was that you?
1408	I looked at it and thought, "oh, well, they fucked up."
1408	That's hilarious.
1408	Were you at Tom's?
1408	Dude, I'm very sorry about the check for the banjo.
1408	I spaced it.
1408	I'll have it to you as soon as I get back into town.
1408	Apologies.
1409	Someone from Parquet's group is very likely to be there.
1409	Government Affairs hadn't planned to intend.
1409	I can give Parquet a call and find out and make sure that there's good coordination with Transwestern.
1409	Or TW can call him directly.
1409	Just let me know.
1409	Best, Jeff
1410	Dean Tyson: It was a pleasure to see you again today.
1410	Phil, it was a pleasure to meet yand I look forward to working together.
1410	Since time is of the essence, I wanted to summarize where we left off at today,s meeting regarding Califs energy crisis.
1410	That summary is attached.
1410	I've also attached three articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolster our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy is a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, itappears that our window of opportunity is very small.
1410	It seems that succesrequires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed that all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of success and is greatly appreciated.
1410	My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made athe meeting.
1410	It represents a &first cut,8 it will undoubtedly change as the details get worked out, and I,m sure I,ve missed something.
1410	So pleashesitate to edit the draft.
1410	Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposalinternally.
1410	As such, I can,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of theproposal.
1410	But I,m confident that the company can support something akin to this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.
1410	In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has playea constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and analysis to policy makers.
1410	That approach seems preferable in this effort awell.
1410	Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washington D.C. office.
1410	If she can help in any way, please don,t hesitate to let mknow.
1410	Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend todiscuss things further.
1410	My home phone is 415.621.8317.
1410	Best, Jeff
1411	I'm greatly indebted.
1411	Thank you.
1412	Thanks.
1412	Was in Sacramento all week watching the machinations.
1412	I'll give you a call this week.
1412	Best to you and yours.
1412	Jeff
1413	Yes, we can.
1413	Others are considering doing the same.
1413	Let's discuss on Monday.
1414	will do.
1415	Leslie, if it's at all possible for you to assist by coordinating with Mike Day and his office, that would be immensely helpful.
1415	If not, no worries.
1415	Just let me know.
1415	Best, Jeff
1416	Thoughts?
1417	I really apologize, but is there any way you could talk to Keith?
1418	Ain't talked to him.
1418	His number is 415.765.8408.
1418	Thanks so much.
1419	Dean Tyson: Attached is the proposal.
1419	Your comments are welcome and appreciated.
1419	I'd be happy to input any that you might have prior to forwading to Secretary Summers.
1419	Phil and I will have a list of potential contacts from the business community to review in the next couple of hours.
1419	If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me.
1419	Perhaps you and Phil and I could touch base later today or this evening to talk about next steps.
1419	Thanks again for your efforts.
1419	Best, Jeff pager: 888.916.7184
1420	Few things: Linda: Thanks very much for the call and the help.Tyson is calling John Doer (sp?) to try to get him in the loop.
1420	And she agreed to send the proposal to Summers today.
1420	Proposal to follow.
1420	I'm working with a guy named Phil Verleger (MIT economist type who worked in Ford and Carter), who I met at the meeting on Saturday, to come up with a list of individuals with Democratic, contributor, business community credientials that can be contacted to seek support for the proposal.
1420	Any suggested contacts that folks have would be helpful.
1420	John Nesslage (who works for Jim) is running some numbers to get an idea of the size of rate increases required to pay back the loans under a 10-year term structure The UC Berkeley econ/biz school faculty members I met with on Saturday want to issue a press release stating there view on "what not to do" (i.e., don't have the state take over anything, period).
1420	They want to give us a copy to review for comments/edits before they issue it.
1420	I should be getting tonite or first thing in the AM tomorrow.
1420	May not go anywhere, but I told them that I'd be happy to review it.
1420	Jeff
1421	you alive?
1422	In office all week.
1423	go ahead and copy from this and give it a go.
1423	you will get a few returns, but the rest should go.
1423	if it completely crashes on you, let me know.
1423	and thanks for the summaries and updates.
1423	please keep them coming.
1423	what's your cell phone #?best, jeff
1424	what time?
1425	David: Great start.
1425	My biggest comment: needs to be shorter (thank the attention span of the press and the political process for that).
1425	I talked to Phil.
1425	He's got an editor that he works with who can help.
1425	I recommend that we have the editor try to boil it down to an "editorial" size piece.
1425	Thoughts?
1425	Best, Jeff
1426	Tyson has gotten a call-back from the governor's office.
1426	She's going to call him back shortly to try to sell him on the plan (i.e., private sector to the rescue) and ensure that he'll come to the party.
1426	She'll call me back as soon as she talks to him.
1426	Curious--do we have any sense of whether there's much activity within the adminstration on this, or can we expect the wait and see approach to continue?
1426	Best, Jeff
1427	Thanks.
1427	FYI: Tyson will also be at Davos.
1427	Suggested list of business leaders to try to bring on board to follow.
1428	Though I didn't have a problem with the course agenda, I'm comfortable with the alternative.
1429	great idea.
1430	Leslie: Jeff and Susan might be able to help with the pipeline charges.
1430	Susan: I'm not ignoring you.
1430	Of course I'll come.
1430	Give me a call and let's figure out a date for me to address your illustrious group.
1430	Jeff: How's married life treating you.
1430	Leslie: Sorry for all the extraneous babbling.
1430	Best, Jeff
1431	Greetings Chris and Jeff: I'd love to, but unfortunately I'll be in New York from Sunday through Tuesday.
1431	Sue, can you handle?
1431	Best, Jeff
1432	the 14th and the 14th (seriously, sorry---that work)!
1433	Is there any migration risk, i.e., can customers choose in Connecticutt?
1433	That will be one of the first questions.
1434	I forgot Bank of America: Hugh L. McColl, Jr., Chairman and CEO
1435	John Nesslage have any luck coming up with what sort of $/kwh we'd be looking at with a private sector bailout?
1436	Here's the suggested list of business leaders to try to bring into the deal.
1436	All comments are welcome and appreciated.
1436	Best, Jeff
1437	Here's the list.
1437	Comments?
1438	I'm going to go ahead and send it to her.
1439	Michael Tribolet: In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court in L.A. The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its undercollections.
1439	(Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers.) The filing is apparently very large.
1439	The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves.
1439	Question to the lawyers: Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?
1439	Probably a good idea to have that filing passed around to this distribution list.
1439	Best, Jeff
1440	Mary Beth: Thanks very much for passing these along to Laura Tyson.
1440	There are two documents.
1440	One is a word file with a suggested list of business leaders that we might bring into the discussions.
1440	Please let the Dean know that it's a first cut and that all comments, suggestions, edits, etc. to the document are welcome and appreciated.
1440	The second is a pdf file from Credit Suisse First Boston giving CSFB's analysis of what's going on in California.
1440	I think it provides further proof that California is still looking for, and ought to be very receptive to, a proposal like the one that we're working on.
1440	Could you let me know that you've received this?
1440	Thanks again.
1440	Best, Jeff
1441	This looks like a job for Dave and/or Sam.
1441	"Katie Kaplan" Please respond to kaplan
1442	You're a star.
1442	I'll let you know.
1442	Best, Jeff
1443	P.S.
1443	Please let Marathon know that the information they're providing is both greatly appreciated and highly valued and we hope that they can continue to poke around and fill us in on what they hear.
1443	Great having multiple data points.
1443	Best, Jeff
1444	Dear Gang: I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom Reports today.
1444	It seems to border on spam at this point.
1444	Is anyone else having this experience?
1444	The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm currently receiving.
1444	Wondering if the lights will stay on today, Jeff
1445	Are we talking 10 hours worth of work for this pleading?
1445	If so, then $2500 seems good.
1446	in the attempt to delete the millions of emails i've received from Telecom Reports, i deleted your Western Gov update before reading it.
1446	could you resend?
1446	your pal,
1447	will do.
1447	thought that you were already on.
1448	It's fun and games every day (can't wait to catch up---you will howl (or cry, not sure which)).
1448	Miss you guys terribly.
1448	Don't throw me out of the club for being AWOL, please.
1448	Hope to see you soon.
1448	Best, Jeff
1449	most indebted.
1450	let's talk about these notes prior to your drafting.
1450	please give me a call.
1451	Mary Beth: For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward (understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).
1451	While I don't disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make the Governor and his staff very uncomfortable.
1451	I would recommend that they do not sign.
1451	Best, Jeff
1452	I don't envy your position.
1452	At some point, the document must be finished and folks need to determine whether they'll sign or not.
1452	I greatly admire Rich Gilbert, but his comments (re: regulatory intervention is a good thing, and now this one) will surely create considerably controversy and could greatly upset the apple cart altogether.
1452	Best of luck, Jeff Talked to Tyson.
1452	She's really working it, which is great, and I continue to focus my efforts there.
1452	My company is squarely behind her efforts.
1452	Thanks again for organizing the meeting last weekend.
1453	Haven't received anything.
1453	Sounds like we all agree that it would be a good idea to do it.
1453	I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us the file.
1453	My preference (in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of thick) is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each week, but i'm willing to discuss.
1453	others have views on how we ought to write 'em up?
1453	Best, Jeff
1454	Prof. Bajaj.
1454	Our understanding is that we'll need the electronic file you talked about on Monday in order to do the first (optional) case (re: helpful questions and spreadsheets).
1454	But we haven't received the file yet.
1454	Could you possibly forward it to us?
1454	We're leaning strongly toward writing the first case up and turning it in and are anxious to get started.
1454	Thanks very much.
1454	Best, Jeff
1455	Tyson has had conversations with the Governor's office.
1455	The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would "look like"/attendees, and has said that the idea sounds like one worth pursuing (but as we know, talk is very cheap with this Governor).
1455	In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting optics/logistics/attendee attributes, etc. They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted.
1455	Tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the Governor's participation.
1455	In the meantime, Tyson is trading calls with Doer and trying to line up other business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the table.
1455	Any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would be useful, but seems that Tyson's going to have to carry that water.
1455	Tyson said based on her conversations with Summers, he's squarely on board.
1456	The way we handled it last time was 1) have a quick chat about it, 2) split up the pieces, 3) once written, pass around the pieces to see if anyone has any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together, and then, for each case, 4) designate one person as the "assembler" of the pieces.
1456	(We designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the semester.) And yes, all by email (save for, say, the preliminary chat).
1456	It worked well.
1456	But I'm flexible, if folks want to try another angle.
1456	Best, Jeff
1457	Took Kahn's place, who's now on the ISO Governing Board.
1458	couldn't get thru on Hoffman's cell #.
1458	Left voice mail for Thomas.
1458	will let you know as soon as anything happens.
1459	Nice job.
1459	Thanks.
1460	Greetings Mary Beth: I'm touching base to see how progress is coming on the document that's being prepared for the Governor's office.
1460	Best, Jeff
1461	Sorry to hear that.
1461	I'll give you a call in the morning.
1461	Best, Jeff
1462	Scott: Thanks.
1462	These summaries are extremely well done and highly valued within the company.
1462	Thanks for the great work.
1462	Best, Jeff
1463	we know anything about this?
1464	Hi Cindy: Mark asked me to give you these to fax to Mark at the Four Seasons.
1464	Three things: Berkeley Academics "Manifesto"--very confidential My preliminary doodlings for a talk I'm giving at an EXNET conference in New York on Monday A one page "backgrounder" that Jim and I put together for the Bush transition team.
1464	Thanks a million.
1464	Jeff
1465	Yes.
1465	Mike Day: please make sure that Mike and Bob are in the loop on any and all filings.
1465	Thanks very much.
1465	Best, Jeff
1466	could you please fax this text to steve and mark?
1466	thanks a million.
1466	jeff
1467	The speaker introduced a bill that would: Order the CA PUC to establish a "rate component" to permit the utilities to recover its "net undercollected amount" over a period of ten years.
1467	(Sounds like there may be a haircut in there somewhere.) Authorize the State Water Dept. to purchase power on behalf of utilities and munis.
1467	Order the CA PUC to create a separate rate component to cover the Dept.'s cost of purchasing the power.
1467	Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any difference between the price the Water Dept. buys the power for and the price that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze.
1467	Authorizes the State Director of Finance to "accept on behalf of the state any tangible asset of an electrical corporation."
1467	(Presumably the state is looking to get something from the IOUs (say, the hydro assets) in exchange for giving the utility it's "net undercollected amount." The bill is long and haven't yet had a chance to review it in detail. We're faxing the bill. The bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the Legislature has bought into it, though the Governor signaled his general support for this sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of the power auction. The Assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today. Will pass on more info as we get it. Jeff
1468	Could you please make sure that everyone in the office has this call-in number.
1468	It's a daily call to discuss California's electricity crisis.
1468	Thanks very much.
1468	call-in: 800.998.2462 code: 4912753
1469	I'll be in NY/D.C.
1469	I'm willing to do by phone.
1469	Thanks.
1470	We'll have an internal call to discuss this prior to launching any missiles.
1470	Jeanne, please have Mike give me a call to discuss.
1470	Thanks.
1470	Jeff
1471	yep.
1472	Joseph: Please contact these folks and remind them that 1) i'm not a lobbyist, 2) i'm not registered as a lobbyist, and 3) i don't qualify as a lobbyist.
1472	thanks a million.
1472	Jeff
1473	David: Accusing market participants of "gaming," "strategic behavoir," "market manipulation," and the like will be extremely controversial, and, I believe, unconstructive.
1473	As you may or may not know, much of the criticism was placed on the utilities strategic bidding on the demand side, which many "economists" and "consultants" seem quite willing and able to conveniently ignore.
1473	Jeff
1474	yes.
1475	I'll put my mind to it (what's left of it).
1476	Tomorrow morning (Saturday), I'll take a whack at building on what Mark's done and distribute to everyone.
1476	FYI, I'm in New York on Monday so won't be in class.
1476	Best, Jeff
1477	I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.
1477	I'm giving a talk at Exnet on Monday about California.
1477	Attached is a draft of the slides.
1477	All comments welcome and appreciated.
1477	I'm continuing to work on it.
1477	Thanks very much.
1477	Best, Jeff
1478	One of the things that came out of the meeting I was at on Saturday with the UC economists (including Tyson and Yellen) was a "manifesto" that they published today (I'll have the final to distribute soon).
1478	They're having a press conference in about 10 minutes at Berkeley.
1478	In anticipation, they're quoted in a story in today's LA Times (that features Greenspan's comments) and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates.
1478	Most of these folks in the group, lamentably, earn their living by consulting for incumbents, but there message here should be helpful, and there are a few "right-minded" economists in the bunch.
1478	(I managed to get Dr. Michaels in the group, who was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto.) It wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the manifesto, though I attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions.
1478	Jeff
1479	Apologies.
1479	I can't keep track of all the distribution lists.
1479	Please let me know if you think that this will be helpful in your neck of the woods.
1479	Rick relayed Summers comments re: Tyson.
1479	Best, Jeff P.S.
1479	I'm forwarding to David Lugar
1480	FYI.
1480	Please let me know if you receive.
1481	Dan: How's things?
1481	Happy New Year.
1481	Hope all's well with you and yours.
1481	Could you please copy us on the UI details?
1481	They will be very useful in what we're up to out here in electricity Disneyland.
1481	Thanks a bunch.
1481	Best, Jeff
1482	Oh, please do fax.
1482	415.782.7854.
1482	And we need some more details (in addition to what Jim did) if possible.
1482	thanks.
1483	i'll be there.
1484	Thank you SO much.
1484	Have a great weekend.
1485	FYI.
1486	One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding) market power.

1487	please send me my login and password so that i can get into the system.
1487	also, please be sure that my account includes E234 and E222.
1487	Thank you.
1488	I'm taking Dylan's and Mark's stuff, adding a bit, and putting it into memo format.
1488	As I recall in class, he doesn't expect or want us to turn in answers to questions, per se, just a 4-page (or so) memo.
1488	I have that right?
1488	I'll circulate the memo later today, or first thing tomorrow in the AM.
1488	Best, Jeff
1489	Thanks, Sandi.
1489	This tracks very well with my chat with Barbara.
1489	Barbara's charcterization of "irrelevant" arguably makes sense from a customer's perspective, but it's very relevant to us, though I didn't give Barbara the details of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our customers, given their contracts with us, would get hurt.
1489	Seems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating the "end" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive "end" and 3) one "freeze" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will continue to be capped going forward (despite the "end" of the rate freeze).
1489	Seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze "ends" next month, or next year, which is something that we're going to want to follow very closely.
1489	Do we have any information on where the negotiations between customers and the utilities ended up this weekend?
1489	Best, Jeff
1490	OK.
1490	Jimmie and I duplicated effort just a bit.
1490	Attached is the memo and the spreadsheet.
1490	Note that in the memo, we have a dispute about whether $750k is adequate.
1490	Therefore, I've left questions 4 and 5 attached to the memo for you folks to reconcile (if they take advantage of discounts and get A/R and inventory rates back in line with '93 rates, is $750 enough?).
1490	Also, I've included a common-size income statement in exhibit 1, a cash flow statement in exhibit 2, and I, too, completed exhibit 3.
1490	We may want to clean up some of the calculations in the spreadsheet, given that we'll likely need to turn them in as attachments.
1490	Hope this helps.
1490	I'd do more, but I'm off for the airport and New York--won't be in class tomorrow.
1490	Best, Jeff
1491	Thanks.
1491	Talk to you on the 8:30 call tomorrow.
1491	Best, Jeff
1492	i'll give you a call.
1492	i'm in new york today.
1492	best, To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Re: Rate Surcharge Proceedings Move Forward Jeff - we'll have to make it a priority today to come to a conclusion on thscope of our testimony.

1493	Sorry.
1493	I figured Sandi would have included it.
1493	Why would I have figured that?
1494	Greetings Professor.
1494	Regrettably, I'm on travel in New York City today and can't make it to class this evening.
1494	I don't anticipate having to miss any other classes this semester.
1494	Regards, Jeff
1495	I've left messages describing our idea with TURN and the large cogenerators/marketers/producers, and I've spoken with the Farm Bureau and the California Manufacturers Association.
1495	The Bureau and CMA agree with our idea and I've asked them to "pass the word along" to other customer groups and to try to ensure that its an integral part of the negotiations.
1495	I'll be calling other customer groups and will report back on those conversations.
1495	Best, Jeff
1496	Thanks.
1496	No apologies necessary.
1496	I'm in NYC, but will try to call you tocatch up.
1496	When does the Dean get back from Davos?
1496	Have you heard any fallout from the "manifesto?"
1496	I'm conerned that Davis & Co. will be agitatby it.
1496	Thanks a million for all your efforts.
1496	Best, Jeff cc: Subject: Re: Final Version-Manifesto Dear Jeff: Sorry I didn't get back to you last week.
1496	I was sick on Thursday and Friday and only dealt with a couple of things.
1496	Unfortunately, not much to report.
1496	Letter sent to Governor's office.
1496	Not even a courtesy call in return.
1496	I spoke with Lynn Schenk on Thursday.
1496	She told me point blank that the Governor and his staff had already solved the energy crisis and that it was too late to convene a meeting such as LDT was suggesting.
1496	Please DO NOT pass on this informationto anyone else in the "Berkeley group."
1496	We'll probably try to reach Schenk again today.

1499	I'm fine and agree that it's more about the reasoning than the right answer.
1499	I don't feel strongly about the recommendation, just wanted to throw out something for folks to shoot at and to highlight that A/R and inventory turnover is big problem.
1499	(Though without A/R and inventory turnover convenants, I don't know if I'd do the deal.) Thanks for doing the finishing touches.

1500	Greetings: I'm in the group (and traveling on the East Coast, returning late tonite).
1500	I can do a conference all today if folks would like.
1500	Otherwise, I'll be working on it on the plane back tonite and will distribute when I get home or first thing in the AM.

1507	Thanks very much, Jeanne.
1508	Yes, but there's a commitment to reverse it in another bill (AB 27X) thatDebra Bowen is carrying.
1508	There is a helluvalot of uproar about that languain the bill and just about everyone is united to fix it.
1508	Keep your fingerscrossed, and we'll keep you posted.
1508	Best, Jeff To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Eric Letke/DUB/EES@EES, George cc: Subject: DA in PG&E and SCE?
1508	Is this statement correct?
1508	Another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access customers during the time that DWR is procuring energy.?
1508	The bill states, "the right of retail end use customers ( to acquire service from other providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies powerhereunder."? Voila.? Not only do we get a rate increase, but our ability tochoose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived.? I would think theaverage Californian would be outraged by that dictate.? Of course, most Californians didn't know that they had a choice.? Therefore, the legislatiomade a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line witexpectations. I wonder what the Legislature will do next week?
1509	On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peevand David Freeman requested.
1509	Mike Peevey was President of Southern California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES).
1509	Freeman is General Manager of LADWP.
1509	The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor.
1509	Freeman is theGovernor,s chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on bof DWR now that the Legislature has passed AB1X and the Governor has signedit.
1509	John Burton, the leader of the State Senate, is responsible for gettinthe Freeman the job of chief negotiator, but Peevey was clearly in charge.
1509	Also at the meeting was Vikram Budraja, former SVP of power systems and planning for Edison.
1509	He,s now a private consultant that Freeman hired thelp him with the contract negotiations.
1509	Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR,s RFP issued on Friday.
1509	Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday.
1509	Thimplied that they,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ dto announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say thatthey,ve got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press).
1509	Their plan is to announce on Tuesday the names of the suppliers they,ve signed with, the total number of megawatts signed, and the average price per MW.
1509	They are concernthat the media will want them to make public the details of each individualdeal, which for obvious reasons they don,t want to do.
1509	Peevey and Freeman also said that they don,t want to sign too many long-term contracts though they recognize that there,s a trade-off between term anprice.
1509	Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond.
1509	ENA is preparing a response.
1509	He also told them that EES was working on a plan to reduce demand at our customers, facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready forimplementation very soon.
1509	I,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peevand Freeman: It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that Dis creditworthy.
1509	Response from Peevey/Freeman: AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st*topurchase the power necessary to fill the utilities, short position.
1509	Ken Lay pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the fundsneeded to pay suppliers.
1509	The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposals.
1509	Response from Peevey/Freeman: Be as creative as possible.
1509	All offers will be considered (despite the language contained in the RFP).
1509	The only customers who have been protected from California,s failed restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct Access.
1509	In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California,shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site generation.
1509	Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally*as AB1X does*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.
1509	Response from Peevey: He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.
1509	Heaffirmed what we already know*that the head of the Senate oversight commDebra Bowen*is working on a &clean-up8 bill to remove the prohibition.
1509	In response to Ken Lay,s points that California needed to make sure that utinterconnection and stand-by rates didn,t continue to impede on-site generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the probleand was prepared to fix it.
1509	Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor)has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants inorder to push the forward curve down.
1509	Response from Peevey/Freeman: The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at expediting siting and development.
1509	DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts supply-side bids.
1509	Response from Peevey/Freeman: They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce the signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators that DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a &reasonable8 price.
1509	They also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs.
1509	Onthey,ve shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman said they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding.
1509	These are the highlights.
1509	I,d be happy to give more details on the Mondmorning \call.
1509	Best, Jeff
1510	Jim: Got your message.
1510	Be happy to be on a call today to discuss California's gas structure.

1511	will do.
1511	sorry for the mix-up.
1512	Thursday, usual time?
1513	We haven't been to the PUC about re-sourcing our customers.
1513	Sue mentioned that this morning.
1513	Good idea to get over there.
1513	Mike's going to the PUC tomorrow to make the rounds.
1513	Is there legislation on DSM and expedited siting?
1513	I haven't seen anything we've provided on DSM or expedited siting-related legislation.
1514	Found 'em.
1515	Hi.
1515	Apologies.
1515	Things have just been nuts.
1515	I will get you that access code to EnronOnline just as soon as I can.

1517	How many am I allowed to get?
1517	And what are the dates for Mazatlan?
1517	Hope to see you guys soon.
1517	Best, Jeff
1518	I've heard nothing about any relief granted.
1518	I will check and get back to you.
1519	Mike, Jeanne: Have you heard anything about any relief on penalties that the PUC might have recently granted interruptible customers?
1519	(Recall that Loretta has refused to allow folks on interruptible to get off those contracts.) Could you let me know as soon as you find something out?
1519	Thanks.
1519	Best, Jeff
1520	we can all use the tax break that bush wants to give us and give to NPR!
1521	We should be able to pull it together.
1521	Mike, I don't have any information about siting or DSM bills.
1521	Could you please add some very brief bullets to your original ones (factual ones rather than advocacy ones) that describe 1) what siting reform bills are out there, what they say, what the chances are for passing, and what the timing for passage seems to be at this point, and 2) same info for DSM.
1521	Thanks a bunch.
1521	Jeff
1522	I'll put my suggested edits directly into the document and send to you for review.
1522	Jeff
1523	don't remind me.
1523	i'll go ballistic.
1524	you're welcome.
1525	Apologies.
1525	It's quick and dirty.
1525	Jeff
1526	Karen Denne has asked me to go along to the meetings tomorrow, which I've agreed to do, but wanted to run it by you two first.
1526	Thoughts?
1526	Best, Jeff
1527	Here are my (very minor) suggestions.
1527	I understand that the plan is to have the letter come from Ken Lay.
1527	Given the current tone and structure of the letter, might be more appropriate to come from Chris, as originally drafted, but I've modified so that it comes from Ken Lay.
1527	Best, Jeff
1528	Be happy to talk tonite about how to pull this together.
1528	Can't do it until 8:30-9PM tonite, though.
1528	That too late?
1528	And, if that's not enough, I don't have conferencing capability from home.
1528	Suggestions?
1528	Best, Jeff
1529	Just to add: Evie represents (largely) the oil companies.
1529	She represented that the suppliers that she represents are negotiating the terms of the agreement with PG&E.
1529	She finished by saying that she was fairly confident that those negotiations would result in the gas suppliers that she represents signing PG&E's agreement and supplying gas under those agreements.
1529	Best, Jeff
1530	Thanks, Carolyn.
1530	I can take a crack at the expansion questions, though someone else may want to also take a look at it, just to keep me honest.
1530	I'll try to distribute first thing in the AM tomorrow.
1530	Best, Jeff
1531	I'd be honored.
1532	No comments.
1532	Chris, I'll have the summary to you shortly.
1532	Jeff
1533	Hi Rosalee: Attached is a summary of the proposal that ENA filed today in response to the RFP for power and gas issued by California's DWR.
1533	Also attached is a copy of the complete proposal.
1533	Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you.
1533	Could you please print out a copy and forward it along to Ken Lay prior to his departure for Washington D.C.?
1533	Thanks very much.
1533	All the best, Jeff
1534	Told him the proposal is on his fax machine.
1534	He thanked me and said he'd get back to us.
1534	He was in a meeting.
1534	That was the sum total of the call.
1534	Thanks for all your help.
1534	Real cat-herding exercise.
1534	Best, Jeff
1535	Thanks TJ.
1535	Unfortunately, I presumed that I wouldn't get in, so didn't attend.
1535	No problem, though, since the two classes that I did get into are great.
1535	Thanks again.
1535	Best, Jeff
1536	Hi folks: Since we have only one page, the write up for number 4 will have to be verybrief.
1536	Before writing it, though, I wanted to offer a few bullets regardinwhat angle we might take, and let folks respond, comment, counter, etc. before writing it up.
1536	I'll clean and beef up once we've agreed to the approach we'd like to take to question #4.
1536	Finally, I can work from my office on this this evening, which means that I can use the conference callcapability of my office phone to patch everyone in if we'd like to do a conference call.
1536	If that's what folks would like to do, I'd prefer to do thcall at around 7 PM.
1536	Just let me know.
1536	Best, Jeff The question for #4 is: Stock price is down 23%, significant debt has already been tapped to suppormassive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more debt.
1536	What should HD do w.r.t.
1536	current operations and future growth strategy?
1536	In the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and EBITgrowth back in line with results from previous years.
1536	(Management,s Letto Shareholders alludes to this, but it,s difficult to determine whethermanagement is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the growspurt and grown earnings, or continue on the growth effort.) With respect to funding future (more moderate growth), the company does hasome room to increase long-term debt (e.g., current ratio for 1986 =3D 2.26It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility byissuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit. As such, Hought to look those sources of funding and fill in any &funding gaps8 with funds from the line of credit. Given the significant drop in stock price, HD is likely better off in thenear term 1) moderating growth, 2) improving performance to generate cashinternally, and 3) using long-term debt issuance to provide the funds needed.
1536	Once performance and stock price improves, then HD should consider a stock issuance.
1536	How can company improve operating performance?
1536	Reduce selling, store operating expenses and pre-opening expenses Improve receivables turnover Improve inventory turnover Improve per store/sales Consider closing poor-performing stores All of which will improve margins Should company change its strategy?
1536	If so how?
1536	Shift from meteoric growth to moderate, targeted growth, and focus on generating positive cash flow from operations Focus on improving performance at existing stores; specifically focus on controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity Consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line in order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibility
1537	Here is the gas settlement from California that we discussed on the conference call yesterday.
1537	Best, Jeff
1538	Ok, we're on for 7 pm.
1538	i've got carolyn's and Mark's #s please pass along others and i'll originate the call from here.

1538	best,
1539	u see my previous note?
1539	sorry, i've been out of the office all day and just got in.
1540	Just wanted to send a note to say that I'm very sorry that I couldn't make it to the meeting, miss catching up with folks, and hope that all's going well.
1540	Hope to see you very soon.

1541	see george w.
1541	and al rap.
1541	very funny, indeed.
1542	whaddya mean?
1542	you mean software?
1543	Gang: Quick question.
1543	Does the lease-buy-back free up $50M of funds for 1987?
1543	Mark, is that captured in the 1987 cash flows?
1543	Don't think that should change our recommendation, but ran across it in the case and was wondering if we captured it.
1543	Best, Jeff
1544	Yeah, but my name's not in it.
1545	I haven't heard that, but I was running around quite a bit yesterday.
1545	Governor Backbone has however been recently attempting to appeal to the Nader (noisy) wing of the party, so it wouldn't be altogether surprising.
1545	We can poke around.
1545	Best, Jeff
1546	I was thinking that it gives them $50M up front (the sale), and then they'll only have to make installment payments for the leases.
1547	Sounds great.
1547	When do we sign up?
1547	Best, Jeff
1548	"In addition, we are pursuing sale-and-leaseback negotitations for an aggregate of approximately $50 million for ten of our stores. These sources of additional funds, along with internally generated cash flow (what internally generated cash flow???), will provide us with an ample financial foundation to continue to underwrite our growth over the next several years."

1551	can you please bring annie with you?
1551	one small request: i'm pretty frazzled with work, school, etc. and am looking forward to relaxing and hanging out with you guys.
1551	it would be great to talk about anything other than 1) the electricity crisis and 2) george w.
1551	bush.
1551	i figure we can talk for hours about how to get the railing done on the deck!
1551	best,
1552	should we point out in memo?
1552	think it's too late to revise?
1553	hi jean: incidentally, you're coverage of the mess via email, etc. has been unequaled.
1553	can't thank you enough.
1553	were there any materials giving more specifics of what the governor proposed today?
1553	thanks very much.
1553	Best, Jeff
1554	It is EXTREMELY useful.
1554	Please continue.

1556	FYI.
1556	Calger is in active talks with Freeman and DWR lawyers about the offer letter we submitted on Tuesday.
1556	Freeman's very anxious to do a deal for 200 MWs from the West Desk and then start talking about a deal for power from Parquet's Pastoria plant.
1556	Credit is of course the issue and Calger's told them that unless the credit issue is bulletproof it's not going to work.
1556	See Chris' comments below.
1556	It looks like progress is being made, but the details will make it or break it.
1556	Any thoughts?
1556	Might make sense to discuss on the call.
1556	Please forward along to others.
1556	Thanks.
1556	Best, Jeff
1557	I'm holding up just fine.
1557	Thanks a bunch for caring.
1557	Have a great time in the Virgin Islands!

1558	Neat.
1559	Thanks very much.

1562	You should feel free to edit away!

1564	Karen: Harry's done some more recent work on the numbers we need to fill in, so he'll fill them in. Harry: the numbers we've thrown around over the last couple of months are: From 1996 to 1999, peak demand increased by 5,522 megawatts, but only 672 megawatts of new capacity was added.
1564	Meanwhile, electricity is growing over 5% per year.
1565	I'll be on the call as will Mike Day, out outside counsel who's been helping us negotiate a fix to the DA prohibition in AB 1X.
1565	Best, Jeff
1566	Hey gang: I think that we should do the case.
1566	I'm willing to help draft, and willing to take a first crack at putting some bullets together about the direction I think the memo ought to take and distribute that by about 5 PM tomorrow.
1566	Though it would be good for other folks to do same and then we could compare notes.
1566	Makes sense?
1566	Thoughts?
1566	Suggestions?
1566	Best, Jeff
1567	FYI.
1567	From my "buddy" Verleger.
1568	No problem.
1568	Just wanted to throw some thoughts into the hopper.
1568	If you've gotten them from Vicky and Tom, then we're set.
1568	Good luck.
1568	Best, Jeff
1569	Just wanted to let you know that I'll be out of the office beginning at 1PM but will be checking voicemail and will be available by cell phone and pager.
1569	Best, Jeff PS I'm listening to the leg hearings by phone.
1569	Legislators are making Bryson and Mission head Al Fohr (Steve, he was the guy at the meeting we had with the Governor's staff) explain in excruciating detail all of the transactions that have taken place since AB 1890 passed (e.g., midwest power plants buys, New Zealand disco buy).
1569	Also interrogating Harold Ray explain Edison's purchasing practices over the past couple of years (i.e., staying short in the market).
1569	Edison's not coming off looking great.
1569	Bryson's trying to do some major triage---and blaming Loretta for keeping Edison short.
1570	Hi: Hope you're well.
1570	Based on your note, I faxed my Direct Deposit change to Renee Kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd received it and that it was in process, but I can't find her name in email.
1570	Any suggestions on how I can check in and see how progress is going?
1570	As always, thanks a bunch.
1570	Best, Jeff
1571	Hi Justin: As we discussed, this is the most recent version of the proposed "fix" to the Direct Access prohibition included in AB1X that the coalition of customer groups have been working on.
1571	They intend to give it to Debra Bowen first thing next week.
1571	Take a look at it and if you have any questions, please let me know and I can explain the concept and how it is intended to work.
1571	I have notified the coalition that it would be a good thing to include you on their distribution list, but I didn't want to do that until I checked with you.
1571	Let me know if that's something that you would like to do.
1571	Best, Jeff
1572	Thank you.
1572	For what it's worth, this tracks well with what I'm hearing.
1572	Best, Jeff
1573	Thanks a million.
1573	Please keep me posted.
1573	See you next week!
1573	Best, Jeff
1574	OK, it's settled.
1574	We will NOT turn in the case this Monday.
1574	Good call, Dylan.
1574	Best, Jeff
1575	This appears to be a note that was sent a very long time ago and just showed up in your in-box.
1575	I'm thinking it was the decision to raise rates that happened beginning of January.
1575	Best, Jeff
1576	Greetings: My apologies.
1576	I was out of town over the weekend and while I thought I'd have network access, I didn't.
1576	Here's the presentation from the talk I gave in New York on 01.29.01.
1576	I'll be updating it, but will work from these slides (as notes--no formal presentation).
1576	If you have any questions, just give a holler.
1576	415.782.7822.
1576	Look forward to meeting on Wednesday.
1576	Best, Jeff
1577	Yes, please ticket.
1578	Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun.
1578	Hope that you made it back safely.
1578	Couple of things: I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too much trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around.
1578	Can I order two cases of coastal zin?
1578	What about the champagne?
1578	How much per magnum is it?
1578	Best, Jeff
1579	Thanks again for your help, advice and Cristina's phone #.
1579	We'll see where it goes from here.
1579	But I'm shocked.
1579	I called Cristina, and NO answering machine.
1579	I didn't think that happened anymore.
1579	Any way of leaving her a message?
1579	Thanks again.
1579	Best, Jeff
1580	On the various matters currently before the California PUC: The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect.
1580	(The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.) The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls.
1580	The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.
1580	In addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week.
1580	So the opportunity to act and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it.
1580	With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a Commission decision adopting an "interim" procurement charge on March 27th.
1580	There is another "workshop" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file formal "advice letters" with the Commission.
1580	Those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the 27th.
1580	Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that DWR incurs to buy power.
1580	Everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole.
1580	(Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops. And until there is clarity on whether the Commission will agree to "pass through" those costs, Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.) Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to "net out" the utilitities' generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap, the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc. Recently, TURN modified its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.
1580	TURN's new position is that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st, the effective date of AB1X.
1580	EES will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze.
1580	We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities' stranded generating assets.
1580	That compensation could come in one of two forms: 1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained, cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference between the "market" value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets.
1580	We are not getting much traction thus far.
1580	The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.
1580	So both sets of issues (the procurement charges and the "end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be "finalized" on March 27, albeit in separate orders. With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers. However, it has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on "charge backs" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward issue. Best, Jeff
1581	Hi Tom: From our contact with the Governor's office, seems that Kari Dohn, formerly in the Governor's office, and recently appointed Chair of the Electricity Oversight Board, would be the hands-down best candidate.
1581	Best, Jeff
1582	No problem.
1582	My pleasure.
1582	Best, Jeff
1583	George: If you get a minute, could you call to de-brief on the meeting we had the Gruma?
1583	Just want to touch base in the event that there's any follow up.
1583	Hope that it was helpful.
1583	Best, Jeff
1584	Don't even worry about it.
1584	Thanks for being sensitive to the issue.
1584	Good to see you guys this weekend, despite all the excitement.
1584	Best, Jeff "Eldon Sellers" Please respond to eldon
1585	you ain't kidding.
1586	I think that it would be best for the Chancellor's office to make the contact/request, but if you need us to help, then Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro or I can make a go of it; but again, I think that it would best for the Chancellor's office to make the invite.
1586	Best, Jeff
1587	Thanks.
1587	I'll take 12 magnums.
1587	And please order 2 cases of Coastal zin.
1587	I think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this weekend.
1587	I can pay you then.
1587	I'm not looking to make money on the grapes.
1587	Just looking for someone to finance the development of my land.
1587	And I'd have a vineyard to look at all the time!
1587	That'd be enough for me.
1587	Thanks for all your help.
1588	On the 21st, Tauzin and Barton are holding separate meetings with executives from the respective stakeholder groups in Southern California to have "frank" discussions about California.
1588	Steve Kean will attend for Enron.
1588	At Steve's meetings will be other gas and electric marketers, and generators.
1588	Linda Robertson would like to talk with us tomorrow about getting Steve prep-ed for the meeting.
1588	She'd like to have the call at 3 PM California time.
1588	Her assistant will be sending details very soon.
1588	Best, Jeff
1589	you're a doll.
1589	thanks.
1589	on this one, feel free to control!
1589	even if Cameron doesn't go up, prentice and i likely will, which means that we'll be stopping by napa (if you guys don't mind).
1590	I'm glad that Enron is in such stellar company.
1590	We did not get out early last night.
1590	See you soon.
1591	Here are some minor edits.
1591	What's the timing of the release?
1591	I can work on it a bit more tomorrow on the plane to Houston if that would be useful.
1591	Best, Jeff
1592	Thanks.
1592	See you tonite.
1592	Looking forward to it.
1592	Best, Jeff
1593	FYI.

1597	Hi Leslie: The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to "produce," it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to "reduce.") That proposal was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week when it was submitted.
1597	We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.
1597	Best, Jeff
1598	One thing: remember we are "cautiously" optimistic.
1598	That qualifier is extremely important, given the lunacy that's underway in California.
1598	Best, Jeff
1599	FYI.
1599	From yesterday's editorial page in the WSJ.
1599	McFadden's one of the folks that signed the "manifesto."
1599	Best, Jeff
1600	Thanks, but for some reason they didn't come across.
1600	Could you resend?
1600	Thanks.
1600	Best, Jeff
1601	I'm on 47.
1601	Please call at 415.505.6633.

1603	Thanks a bunch.
1603	Jeff
1604	FYI.
1604	This was floating around yesterday.
1604	Best, Jeff What happened to the Governor's "commitment?"
1605	Laura: Attached are the letters that I referenced in the previous email.
1605	The letters: oppose SBX33--Burton (state takeover of the private electric utilities' transmission lines) oppose SBX6--Burton (state takes significant position in generation, gas & electric transmission, energy conservation, renewable resources, real-time meters support SBX5--Sher (increase funding for energy efficiency) Again, if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822. Best, Jeff
1606	yes.
1607	Wow.
1607	This guy sounds impressive!
1607	I agree with Prentice's assessment (of course, I always agree with Prentice's assessment).
1607	Best, Jeff Happy Valentine's Day to all.
1608	Bill: Here's the coalition's proposed language to "fix" the Direct Access problem.
1608	Best, Jeff
1609	Yes.
1609	I'll be on the call.
1609	FYI: I'm here in Houston!
1609	Best,Jeff
1610	Thanks a million.
1610	You're very kind.
1610	Whatever happens, happens, but it sure will be fun and exciting exploring the vine possibilities!
1610	Happy Valentine's Day.
1610	All the best, Jeff
1611	sure.
1611	what's the price tag?
1612	Sorry, but could you please print these out for me?
1612	If the "eei.doc" is too long, please just print out the other two.
1612	Thanks a million.
1612	Best, Jeff
1613	Hi Vicki: I'll try to track it down.
1613	Jeff
1614	I'm told that APS filed against PG&E and "APEC"?
1614	also filed against PG&E.
1614	Best, Jeff
1615	will do.
1615	thanks.
1616	you done good, fella.
1616	how's life at 50 treating you?
1616	it was great to seeyou, and between you and me, i don't think that anyone would come close toguessing that you're fifty.
1616	i want you to know that i'm constantly trying to figure out how i can get down to s.d.
1616	to spend some time together.
1616	it's something that i very much look forward to, but i gotta tell you, man, working for enron and attending UC's evening mba program is kicking my buttthe good news is that enron has seen fit to promote me (senior director---onotch below v.p.), and i didn't even have to move to houston....and crossyour fingers---if things work out i may sign a contract with a winemaker tobuy grapes from 10 acres of vines on the land that i bought on the sonoma/mendocino coast (vines ain't planted yet; way it works is you get thcontract from the winemaker and use the contract to finance the developmentof the vines).
1616	anything but a slam dunk, but i'm going to work hard (andhave fun) trying to make it happen.
1616	it was great to see you in Oakland and thanks very much for the kind note.
1616	you will always be an very dear friend and you can count on me showing up oyour doorstep soon.
1616	give jessica a hug and a kiss.
1616	all the best, p.s.
1616	confidentially, and i know you'd never take it, but ken lay's been throwing your name around quite a bit as the "top choice" for a FERC position.
1616	also, (and i'll tell you more when we get together), i was on apanel in new york with dan fessler!
1616	he was the same, though arguably a beaten, dejected man, based on what he did to California.

1617	Also, the contact information for our lobbyist in Sacramento is: Scott Govenar Governmental Advocates Best, Jeff
1618	Yes, I'll put it on my calendar.
1618	Can you come to SF?
1619	FYI.
1620	Laura: Attached is a 1 1/2 pager that gives 1) the extensive list of folks who are in the coalition and 2) the message points that they'll be using in a meeting that will take place today with Senator Bowen and other stakeholders to discuss "fixing" AB 1X's prohibition on Direct Access.
1620	Best, Jeff
1621	thanks.
1621	are you getting just opus, or overture and opus?
1622	Very sweet.
1622	Thank you very much.
1623	we likely come by friday nite to pick up annie to go to the dome, and then we can come back early on monday to pick up wine and kick your butts at spades?
1624	I'd send to Leff for distribution.

1627	Greetings folks: I have a meeting from 9-1 tomorrow that I must attend.
1627	Any chance of doing at 8 am.
1627	Apologies for the conflict.
1627	Jeff
1628	I'd vote for 8.
1629	As he said in the note, we can wait on the tile.
1629	We'll contact our pal karen, the tiling queen, and report back.
1629	sound reasonable?
1630	no information is yet public.
1630	you may want to see if they have a website and if there's any information there.
1630	best,
1631	Here's a quick and dirty summary.
1631	Apologies that it ain't proofed.
1631	Please provide any edits that you deem necessary to make it accurate and cogent.
1631	Thanks very much.
1631	Best, Jeff
1632	Thanks for the congratulations.
1632	What is Stormin' Norman asking for?
1633	Good luck.
1633	If it's not too much trouble, an email summarizing the day's festivities would be helpful.
1633	Parquet ever get in touch with you?
1634	Got your message.
1634	Just as soon as we get out from under the deliverables Lay needs for Brulte, I'll turn to figuring how to get Delaney hooked up with decision makers that can make a difference in California.
1634	Is next week too late for meetings?
1634	Best, Jeff
1635	Please forward my apologies for missing the call.
1635	I ended up receiving a "fire-drill" assignment that needs to get done in the next couple of hours.
1635	I'll try to loop back toward the end of the day and update you on what's going on.
1635	Very sorry about that.
1635	Best, Jeff
1636	Hi: you taking the afternoon off?
1636	If so, have a great afternoon!
1636	Best, Jeff
1637	Happy holiday to you, too.
1637	Is it too late to request that tonite's class (Tasker--Financial Information Analysis) get taped?
1637	Best, Jeff
1638	Thanks, Christian.
1638	We're including it in the package to Brulte and will let you know how it proceeds.
1638	Best, Jeff
1639	Steve: Here's a substantially more cleaned-version, with attachments.
1639	There's ahard copy on your chair.
1639	Best, Jeff
1640	FYI.
1641	Hi Rosalee: Steve asked that I forward this to you.
1641	I believe that Steve left you a voicemail describing the nature of the email.
1641	All the best, Jeff
1642	Greetings All: First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.
1642	Schedule ivery tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing thismorning, with some back-up info that I've included below.
1642	Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening for delivery to Sen. Brulte.
1642	It's of course confidential.
1642	Few points: I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that wouldbe appreciated.
1642	As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wiour proposed legislation.
1642	This email does not contain the legislation.
1642	Mike sent the "final" versionof our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
1642	You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver to his office today the proposed legislation.
1642	Again, based on our call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposedlegislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
1642	When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the sametime that we deliver the Senator Brulte.
1642	I'm assuming that you folks willhandle that end of things.
1642	Please let us know at your convenience to whomyou've decided to circulate.
1642	This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation.
1642	But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute "to the world," or if we'll need insteadto tailor some new language.
1642	I think we all agreed that we need a "one pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate thepackage effectively.
1642	We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals.
1642	We didn't finalize that plan.
1642	Perhaps the Sacramento team coulpropose a plan to do that.
1642	Perhaps we could start with our friends in theDirect Access coalition?
1642	We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative package/message.
1642	We're in a meeting with folks today where wecan discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contactedMarathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
1642	You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWRcredit issue.
1642	As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.You note that attached to the email is a "legislative fix" to AB1X that cousolve the credit issue and an attached set of "taking points" related to asecond alternative to solving the credit issue: a PUC order clarifying thaDWR will get its money for power purchase costs.
1642	Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push toget the utilities out of the merchant function.
1642	Accordingly, I've put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section (legislative solution) under the topic "create a real competitive retail market in California."
1642	To the best of my knowledge, we don't have legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.
1642	If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, pleasedon't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.
1642	I can be best reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184.
1642	Thanks to all for helping pull this together.
1642	Best, Jeff
1643	Looks like we'll be staying the night and leaving in the AM.
1644	was travelling all week.
1644	would be happy to discuss this weekend, but i'd need to be by phone, since i'll be in mendocino.
1644	are the handouts from thursday that i need to get?
1644	Best, Jeff
1645	will do.
1645	thanks.
1646	Scott Govenar, our outside lobbyist, (916.448.8240) and Mike Day, our outside counsel, might also be useful resources for you, John.
1646	Best, Jeff
1647	Thanks a million, Jean.
1648	Thanks very much.
1648	Let's keep trying.
1648	And congratulations on a great find in Roger.
1648	Best, Jeff
1649	We'll need to discuss further internally, but they may be correct in their assessment.
1649	Best, Jeff
1650	I apologize, but I won't be in SF Monday evening, and this week coming up will be a grinder.
1650	I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend, though.
1650	I can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent to me.
1650	And I assume that they are on the Izio site, too.
1650	I'm going to go there now.
1650	Tomorrow, I'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day.
1650	Then perhaps we can email each other on Monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the end of the day.
1650	That should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up Tuesday and Wednesday.
1650	If I can't get the materials off of Izio, I'll let you know.
1650	I'll report back in the AM tomorrow with a proposed game plan, once I've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit.
1650	Sound reasonable?
1650	Thoughts?
1650	Just let me know.
1650	Mark, I hope that if you're in Denver, that means you're skiing.
1650	Best, Jeff
1651	Got everything off of Izio.
1651	I'll start messing with it and report back tomorrow.
1651	If others want to do the same, have at it, and we can compare notes.
1651	Best, Jeff
1652	Looks fine to me.
1652	What's your expectations re: Freeman paying us what he owes us?
1652	Best, Jeff
1653	FYI.
1653	I told Chris that it looks fine with me.
1653	Seems like a useful tactic, i.e., maybe if you pay me what you owe for power already delivered, I might consider doing a deal for power going forward....
1653	Best, Jeff
1654	Fax number (in LA) is 213.897.9560.
1654	I don't have the address.
1654	Did we use the LA address on the original response letter delivered on 2.6.01?
1654	I can't recall.
1654	Let me know.
1654	I can call and get the address if necessary.
1654	Best, Jeff
1655	FYI.
1655	Here's the version that Kean and I sent to Ken Lay's office for transmittal to Brulte.
1655	Ken Lay may have chaged it a bit.
1655	I'll find out anlet you know, but wanted you to have what we forwarded to him.
1655	Thanks agaifor all the help.
1655	Best, Jeff
1656	I took a stab at drafting the memo.
1656	I pooped out on the last question, however and was only able to jot down some thoughts.
1656	Caution: The memo ain't been proofed.
1656	I did it as a memo to the CEO of Timberland, but we don't need to do it that way.
1656	Also attaching files (one each for each of the scenarios asked for, so that folks could see what I did).
1656	Have not constructed the "one-page attachment, however. Let me know what you think. Best, Jeff
1657	Since it seems like folks may have only been sporadically receiving my emails, please let me know if you receive the memos and accompanying spreadsheets that I just sent.
1657	Thanks.
1657	Best, Jeff
1658	Wow, thanks Dylan.
1658	I thought that I was on the hook for this one.
1658	Let me know what I can do to help.
1658	I've read it and will look at what Mark's done and throw my 2 cents in. I'll be working on it tomorrow morning.
1658	Best,
1659	I'm on the case.
1659	I'll look at what you folks did and take a crack at writing the memo.
1659	I'll shoot for writing and sending around at some point today.
1659	Otherwise, it'll be tomorrow.
1659	Best, Jeff
1660	Greetings.
1660	I have left two messages on the voice mail authorizing the help desk to delete everything in my haas account.
1660	That should help.
1660	Please consider this email authorization to delete everything in the account.
1660	Thanks.
1660	Best, Jeff
1661	I can' t thank you enough for organizing my business cards.
1661	I know it's a pain and I really appreciate it.
1661	Thank you so much.
1661	Also, I've got an entry in my bank account (EDI payment) for abou $5700.
1661	Do you have the paper for that?
1661	Do I have any other expense thing-ees coming?
1661	Thanks, Jeff
1662	thanks so much for dinner.
1662	it was really, really good.
1662	and SO sorry for beating the pants off of you in spades (tee hee).
1662	and i JUST put your check for the wine in the mail!
1662	have a great week.
1662	Best, Jeff
1663	yes.
1663	check for 576.29 is in the mail!
1663	thanks so much for getting the coastal, and the champagne, and the opus!
1663	can't thank you enough.
1663	i've also mailed you a new bottle of oyster sauce.
1664	Please turn comments around as quickly as possible.
1664	The folks in Sacramento need them by 1 PM CST.
1664	Thanks very much.
1664	Best, Jeff
1665	In all week, except tomorrow, when I'll be in Pasadena with Steve Kean at a meeting of Republican Congressional folks to discuss CA's electricity mess.
1666	Linda: I will have the California update done for Steve today.
1666	Maureen, could I possibly get the fax # where Steve will be staying this evening in the event that I need to fax it to him directly?
1666	What time will he be leaving for LA?
1666	Thanks.
1666	Best, Jeff
1667	Well, this would seem to indicate one of two things: either Hertzberg's is now an absolute lost cause, or it's more urgent than ever to have Ken Lay talk to him.
1667	Given the situation, it would still seem prudent to have Ken Lay talk to the Speaker.
1667	Best, Jeff
1668	Carolyn, you're a star.
1668	Thanks for the input , Anil.
1668	For what it's worth, I'll take a final looksee this evening and tie up any loose ends (though I doubt that there will be any).
1668	I'll send around to all for one last peek in the morning, and I'll bring a copy to turn in. Sound reasonable?
1668	Let me know.
1668	Best, Jeff
1669	Thank you.
1669	I'll be picking Steve up at the hotel and 9:30 am tomorrow morning.
1669	And thank you very much for paging him for me.
1669	Best, Jeff
1670	Sorry, Mike.
1670	Just got this.
1670	Will try to turn it around pronto.
1670	Our guy John Neslage is trying to pull together exactly what you're requesting.
1670	He'll get it to you as soon as we've got it pulled together.
1670	Best, Jeff
1671	Thanks very much, Rosalee.
1671	Have a nice evening.
1671	Best, Jeff
1672	Man, you're quick.
1672	Thanks very much.
1672	This is really starting to get wierd.
1672	Makes Cuba look capitalist.
1672	Best, Jeff
1673	We'll need to brief Steve on the fed/state issues tied to the state buying the TX systems of PG&E and Edison prior to his meeting with the Congressional Republicans tomorrow.
1673	I'll be driving with Steve from LA to Pasadena (where the meeting is) tomorrow beginning at about 9:30 AM PST (the meeting's at 10:30 AM PST).
1673	Could we put together a call-in number at 9:45 or 10 AM PST so you could quickly/briefly brief Steve on the issues prior to the 10:30 AM meeting?
1673	Let me know if this works, or if there's a better way to get him up to speed on the issues before the meeting.
1673	Thanks very much for helping to pull this together on such short notice.
1673	Best, Jeff
1674	FYI.
1674	We should discuss on tomorrow's call.
1674	Best, Jeff
1675	Dudes: My other team has now finished the case that's due on Thursday (in another class), so I will spend this evening turning what's been passed around into memo format and distribute for review and comment by (what will likely be late) this evening.
1675	I'm travelling tomorrow--back late afternoon--and can work on it more tomorrow night.
1675	Best Jeff
1676	Shmuel: Flattered that you would ask.
1676	I should be able to participate.
1676	Let's discuss further.
1676	Give me a call.
1676	415.782.7822.
1676	Best, Jeff
1677	Message Points Recent legislative proposals designed to have the state play a dominant rolin developing, owning and operating power plants in California (SB6X--Burtoand buy PG&E and Edison's electric transmission assets (SB33X--Burton) aretaking California in the wrong direction and won't solve the State's electricity crisis. Two new bills are equally disturbing: AB60X (Hertzerg) would make plant certification contigent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to thstate at "just and reasonable, cost based rates." SB39X (Spier) would makepower plant owners public utilities The proposals represent a political solution, not a commercial, financial,economic or technical solution. As a political solution, these bills will not increase supply, decrease demand, or get the utilities back on their financial feet. In fact, it's worse than that. These bills will exacerbate California's problems: The transaction contemplated in SB33X is extremely complex, requiring approval by state and federal authorities, bondholders, creditors and others. California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time andresources trying to achieve the deal, with no certainty of success, particularly in view of PG&E's public opposition. In the meantime, summerapproaches, and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering. Thiscomplex, costly and litigious alternative will not lessen the serious threaof blackouts that California faces this summer. SB6X would have the state finance, develop, own and/or operate power plantsin the state. ? Unfortunately, the proposal being offered will not solve the problem; rather, it,s a significant step backward that will make matters worse inCalifornia. ? The reason? Rather than remove California,s roadblocks to increasedgeneration and transmission investment, this proposal requires California tuse taxpayer dollars to get into the business of financing, owning and operating power plants and transmission. ? The best solution ) recognized across the country and around the world ) is for the state to allow private companies to site new generation immediately?
1677	Once built, California could easily enter into contracts with private power plant developers and avoid using taxpayers, dollars.
1677	?
1677	Given government,s other failed experiments in other large scale participation into public power, like TVA, BPA, NYPA, it is highly unlikelythat a California state agency will succeed in doing something that privatecapital is better equipped and willing to do.
1677	?
1677	In the short, the proposal is neither in the public interest nor rational?
1677	Issuing debt to build power plants and take over transmission systems costs consumers money and takes money away from investments in schools and otherimportant priorities.
1677	?
1677	We would be willing to work with the Legislature to help craft a bill thagets more supply in California quickly, efficiently, and in an environmentally sound manner, but this draft achieves only one goal: creating more bureaucracy.
1678	Three articles that folks might find of particular interest written in the past couple of days.
1678	Best, Jeff
1679	Fellows: OK, here's the beginning of the memo.
1679	I'm still working on it, but work cratered on me and I have to switch back to that now.
1679	I'll have a draft finished by tomorrow night and I'll redistribute.
1679	Couple things.
1679	Check the DuPont.
1679	Asset turn needed to be changed, because the pro form calcs hadn't taken the cash out of the assets.
1679	That bumps the ROE up some.
1679	See my attached file, I decompose ROE using an alternative method (Mark, the one Tasker used in class) just to do a check, and the numbers turn out the same.
1679	I also ran some turnover ratios for AHP and Warner (understanding the limitations of one year's numbers.) Questions: Don't we have to assume that covenants will force AHP to dump its divident payout?
1679	Folks likely to get unhappy about that?
1679	Should we care, or should we just expect a rotation out of the stock by dividend-loving investors and rotation in by capital-gains loving investors?
1679	Could we persuade the new management to lever up with an argument that with all that cash on the books, AHP is ripe for takeover?
1679	Anyway just some thoughts.
1679	I'll finish it up tomorrow and re-distribute.
1679	Herr Jackson: I haven't had a chance to review your comments, but I'll incorporate those in tomorrow as well.
1679	Best, Jeff
1680	ah jeez, nobody tell timi and rory....
1681	Sue: Could you use your contacts with Edelman to get on the phone with Scott, Mark and Karen to jump start this thing?
1681	Best, Jeff
1682	Any intelligence from "closed door" meeting?
1683	nice smushing.
1684	OK, last call for comments.
1684	Need them by noon.
1684	I'll bring copies to class for everyone, including Ms Tasker.
1684	Best, Jeff
1685	Hey folks.
1685	Mr. Jackson makes some very good points, which I'd like to include.
1685	However, before I work them in, wanns make sure that everyone agrees with his comments, since including some of his will require some modifications to the direction that the memo takes.
1685	We could discuss in a brief conference call if folks wish.
1685	Also, please review what I've done--not major edits, but edits (with some questions and additions) nonetheless.
1685	Best, Jeff
1686	Sorry, to fill your in-boxes, but wanted to make sure that you folks have the comments that are getting filed.
1686	Best, Jeff
1687	Dude.
1687	You rock.
1687	A hearty, hearty congratulations.
1687	Wish you all the best and great success in your new role.
1687	Best, Jeff
1688	Thanks very much, John.
1688	When this is complete, I'd like to send to the larger distribution list.
1688	In fact, if you concur, I'd like to send this around to the rest of the group right now.
1688	Let me know.
1689	You're very sweet.
1689	Thank you very much.
1689	However, I still am counting the days, and looking forward to, working with you folks.
1689	Best, Jeff
1690	To say that you are a treasure is apt, though understates the incredible job that you do and the wonderful person that you are to work with.
1690	Congratulations and all the very best.
1690	Best, Jeff
1691	thank you, cindy.
1692	Thank you very much for the kind thoughts.
1692	All the best and I hope that all is well in your neck of the woods, Best, Jeff
1693	Here they are.
1693	Best, Jeff
1694	A very, very hearty congratulations on your promotion, Ms Leibman.
1694	Best, Jeff
1695	Thank you very much for including me on this.
1695	Really great to see you last week.
1695	Hope to see you again soon.
1695	And thanks very much for a great dinner.
1695	Best, Jeff
1696	Thanks.
1696	How quaint.
1697	I think that this is what Sandi was referring to.
1697	If not, please let me know.
1697	Best, Jeff
1698	Sue: The way that I understood what Loretta said, the utilities will not be forced to absorb the shortfall between the price cap and DWR's cost of power.
1698	Instead, she said that DWR will be responsible for those costs.
1698	(That ought to make DWR an even less creditworthy entity.) I'll check in with Mike Day's folks to make sure that I heard correctly and get more details.
1698	Will report back just as soon as we get more information.
1698	Best, Jeff
1699	Carol: Steve should double check.
1699	As I understand it, they did vote out the decision implementing AB1X, however, the decision removed the language prohibiting direct access and made DWR, not the utility, "responsible" for any shortfalls caused by the difference between the price cap and DWR's cost of buying power.
1699	Best, Jeff "Carol Hudson" Please respond to carol
1700	Ginger: Could you please forward this along to the Quinn-Gillespie folks---David Lugar in particular?
1700	Thanks very much.
1700	Others: Attached are excerpts from the California Leg Analyst's Report--an "independent" institution in Sacramento--on the electricity crisis, the plan thus far to address it, and the effect that the solution might have on the State's financial position.
1700	Also have attached URL to full report.
1700	Best, Jeff
1701	Greetings.
1701	Thanks for the help yesterday.
1701	I may have missed it, but could you forward me the memo describing the 203 stuff?
1701	Greatly appreciated.
1701	Best, Jeff
1702	Joe: My apologies.
1702	It was buried deep in this thing that I used to call an in-box.
1702	Found it shortly after I wrote the note.
1702	Thanks again.
1702	Best, Jeff
1703	WHAT?!!?
1704	Here's the piece put out by the academics.
1704	Best, Jeff
1705	thank you.
1705	got message that call is now at 11:30 am.
1706	FYI.
1706	Mirant announced a 750MW deal with DWR, but story only said "for March" so unclear what term is.
1707	Please keep confidential (for now), and please forward to Bev.
1707	Thanks.
1707	Best, Jeff
1708	Hi darlin'.
1708	I'm here, been spending a lot of time on an EES crisis (surprise?).
1708	can i call you in about 15-30 minutes?
1709	biz cards.
1710	Thanks.
1710	You do the same.
1710	Best, Jeff
1711	thanks.
1711	sorry about that.
1711	please apologize to hedy.
1711	Best, Jeff
1712	Yes, that's my sister.
1712	She graduated (undergrad) in 1979 (don't tell her that I told you, but I think that she was first in her class).
1712	Married to a very nice guy (Mike Bentivoglio)--also Haas '79.
1712	He's now the head of corporate planning at Schwab.
1712	Have a great weekend.
1712	Best, Jeff
1713	Thanks again, John.
1713	Best, Jeff
1714	Dollar amount: $7,500.
1714	Project: Retain MRW & Associates to assist in developing a rate structure for California that solves the utilities' financial solvency issues without applying "rate shock" to the state's economy, businesses or consumers.
1714	Use the rate plan to develop an alternative to Governor Davis' proposal to nationalize the state's electric industry.
1714	Subject: California Electricity Crisis
1715	Congratulations.
1715	Freeman is such a reasonable guy....
1715	Best, Jeff
1716	FYI.
1717	Greetings.
1717	If you have a minute, can you give me a call?
1717	I'd like to get you up-to-date on what's going on in this crazy electricity industry.
1717	Best, Jeff
1718	The guy negotiating the bill on behalf of IEP told me that there's a 35-40% chance that it will make it out of the Senate by the end of next week, which means that it still has quite a ways to go.
1718	Best, Jeff
1719	Dude: got your message last nite--just missed it.
1719	called you on your cell, but no answer.
1719	very sorry to have missed your birthday.
1719	glad you like the presents.
1719	we'd definitely like to get together with you guys.
1719	hope to see ya soon.
1719	best, yes, we are evil.
1720	Greetings: I'm going to finish this up in the next few hours and send out.
1720	Dylan, go ahead and calculate using operating cash rather than income and send along and I'll incorporate.
1720	I'll try to work Jimmy's stuff in a bit, too.
1720	Best, Jeff
1721	Gents: Here it is.
1721	Please insert directly any proposed edits using strike-out-underline.
1721	Need them no later than 10 AM tomorrow in order to have incorporated and ready to go for class tomorrow.
1721	Dylan, just go ahead and put your operating cash flow nos.
1721	in (and any other changes you have) and send on back.
1721	All: recall that we are limited to 4 pages of text.
1721	Best, Jeff
1722	Thanks so much.
1722	Hope that all is well with you and yours.
1722	All the best, Jeff
1723	In all week, save Wednesday for AB1890 meeting in Sacramento.
1724	FYI.
1724	Best, Jeff
1725	haven't heard.
1725	i'll check in today.
1726	We should cast a little broader net on this internally--Yoder, Calger, Belden, Foster, Sanders, etc.--but seems that, given the Governor's actions as of late, the likelihood of nonpayment might even be a bit higher than 25%.
1726	Best, Jeff
1727	Greetings: Best info to date on TX deal is today's Wall Street Journal.
1727	Best, Jeff
1728	RE: the tx buyout announced on Friday.
1728	the best info available is the story in today's WSJ.
1728	that help?
1728	Best, Jeff
1729	OK, here's what I propose.
1729	Dylan: Galant and much appreciated effort to quantify the value of the tax shield.
1729	However, my day's completely out of control and resolving now may be more than we can manage.
1729	I propose that I simply delete the one sentence quantifying the value of the shield and leave it as a qualitative statement.
1729	If you folks would like to mess with with it some more, that's great with me, it's just that--and I apologize--I just won't be able to work on it today.
1729	If you decide to do some more with it, go ahead and please bring copies to class.
1729	Otherwise, I'll just delete the sentence referenced above, print out, and bring to class.
1729	Just let me know.
1729	And Dylan, from someone whose surname gets butchered all the time, my apologies for having done the same to yours in the memo.
1729	Best, Jeff
1730	This case is killing me!
1730	1) I had to get before 10 AM today.
1730	2) So much for that leisurely 2-hour coffee and morning paper at the neighborhood cafe---not today, thank you!
1730	3) My nap!
1730	Fahgetaboutit.
1730	I'm going to be a wreck tonite.
1730	Best, Jeff
1731	Cameron: Thanks for a dee-licious dinner.
1731	(I did steal a couple pieces of duck---curiosity killed the cat---and it was dee-lectible.) Couple things: Very, very nice to go through all that to get reservations at La Folie and I of course love the place, but I was thinking that maybe we ought to go somewhere that's a tad less expensive.
1731	I'm thinking that Sean ain't even a big food person, that he's not working, that Molly to bring down a king's ransom in her biz, and Tom and Karen are, after all, vegetarians.
1731	Anywho, it's really kind of you guys to want to go there, but I'm just throwing out the notion that maybe we should go to another place that's just a wee bit less dear.
1731	Maybe that other French place that's just one room that we went to out in the Avenues.
1731	Just a thought.
1731	Whatever you guys want to do is fine with me.
1731	Also, I'm happy to do a "whole family" thing----well, maybe "happy's to strong" (we kid!).
1731	I was actually trying to pull it together last Xmas, but found out that my sister and her hubbie only do their big xmas party once a year, so had to scratch it.
1731	I ain't necessarily all that keen, though, on having all get together--particularly for the first time--with the focus being my birthday.
1731	So maybe we can have another event sometime soon where we can bring the thundering hoards together at one place----Lord help us.
1731	Finally, what's the plan for your dad?
1731	I just found out that I'm supposed to be in Houston for an "all hands" meeting on--you guessed it--March 9th, but if there's something planned for that evening, I intend to tell my buddies at Enron that I can't make the meeting.
1731	Please let me know so that I can cancel Houston in advance.
1731	Finally, and MOST important.
1731	Today is the Man in Black's birthday.
1731	God bless the real king, Johnny Cash.
1731	Best, Jeff
1732	Sending again.
1732	Prentice said that she didn't get it, so just wanted to make sure that it wasn't lost in cyberspace somewhere.
1732	Jeff
1733	Thanks very much.
1733	Very interesting.
1733	We'll be a lot more aligned once they've paid us...
1733	Best, Jeff
1734	I'm getting him deck railing, a new pump, a new fire place, new skylights, a new roof, and a new car.
1735	Greetings: Please review the attached.
1735	It's a summary I've put together of a very lengthy analysis MRW did for us over the weekend.
1735	I've also attached theconsiderably lengthier MRW memo for those who'd like to see it.
1735	The tablesincluded in the summary are pulled directly from the MRW memo.
1735	The analysionly addresses the utilities undercollection (i.e., solvency) and doesn'taddress any additional increases that might result from DWR's buying activities.
1735	The Bottom Line =15 By raising average rates 10% over a 10-year period, California couldreturn the utilities to solvency, and 2) help close the supply-demand gap by providing customers with better price signals.
1735	=15 California could achieve these goals under this new rate structure and at the same time exclude one-third of residential customers from any increaseIf California chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structurCalifornia would only need to raise average rates by about 8.8%.
1735	=15 This level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other states (e.g., Washington: 28-34%; Montana: 4.5-32%; Idaho: 6.0-24%; Nevada: 7-12.5%; New Mexico 12%).
1735	We'll need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before going public with the numbers as part of our broader effort, but it offers a reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives (like spending thekids lunch money on crumbling, broken down transmission systems).
1735	Please provide feedback as soon as possible, and perhaps, Paul we concludethe MRW work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily conference caBest, Jeff
1736	Agree.
1736	Sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed, and consistent with what we've said all along, non?
1736	Thanks, Harry.
1736	Jeanne, while your at it, could you get us a new Governor?
1736	Thanks so much.
1736	Best, Jeff
1737	Please don't be insulted, but this will provide a useful tool internally.
1737	Thanks again for a great job.
1737	Best, Jeff
1738	Hey, how's things?
1738	Long time not chat.
1738	What's up?
1738	Anywho, you seem like the right person to respond to this email.
1738	(And I have no idea.) Best, Jeff
1739	FYI.
1740	FYI.
1740	Chris: Any progress with Freeman on creditworthiness issues?
1740	Best, Jeff
1741	Thanks, Jeanne: Couple of thoughts.
1741	1) If California wants to get out of this crisis, it's critical that DWR be creditworthy.
1741	Bilas' proposal helps in that regard.
1741	We've been thinking pretty hard about the issue and working with DWR to try to fix creditworthiness concerns.
1741	Christian, it might make sense to put together some comments supporting Bilas' approach and perhaps give him some additional recommendations about what the PUC needs to do to get DWR creditworthy?
1741	If so, (see note below), we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the PUC by this Friday.
1741	2) Scott Govenar--on the direct access piece.
1741	Seems like it would be very useful to get the DA coalition we're working with in Sacramento to jointly file some comments on Friday in response to the Bilas proposal supporting a ban on any PUC action on the DA prohibition since the Legislature is still working on it.
1741	What are your thoughts?
1741	And if you and the rest of the Sacramento team agree, can we work with Jeanne to get some (brief) language put together and work to get the rest of the coalition to sign on.
1741	Alternatively, we could work to get the other folks file individually.
1741	Your thoughts on both approaches is appreciated.
1741	Best, Jeff
1742	got sent back the first time.
1743	I'll forward this along.
1743	Thanks.
1744	FYI.
1744	Not sure 1) who the right person is to forward this along to, or 2) if it's something that folks want to follow up on.
1744	Anyway, here's the dope---Scott is an Enron outside lobbyist located in Sacramento.
1744	Best, Jeff
1745	Have these letters been sent?
1745	If so, Linda, would it be possible to have overnighted to me "official versions" of the letters?
1745	Greatly appreciated.
1745	Best, Jeff
1746	Thanks a million, buddy.
1746	Very useful.
1747	Thanks.
1747	What's your fax number?
1747	I'll get a copy of the Bilas alternate decision to you as soon as I can.
1747	Best, Jeff
1748	Dude: Could you please fax to me ASAP a copy of the Bilas alternative (415.782.7854)?
1748	Thanks very much.
1748	Best, Jeff
1749	Just faxed it to you.
1750	Greetings Catherine and Roger: A PUC staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in Ontario, CA called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit issues.
1750	The staffer says that "a hospital might also be involved."
1750	Can you provide any more information?
1750	The PUC staffer does not seem to have much information, but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking us to explain.
1750	Sort of ironic: PUC Commissioner Woods states that his goal is to drive all ESPs from the state, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs a bill prohibiting Direct Access, and now the PUC is concerned that California might actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice.
1750	(The PUC is particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas customers from returning to the LDC---ironic indeed) Any information that you folks can provide as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.
1750	Best, Jeff
1751	Thanks, Mike.
1751	Given time constraints, might be more efficient if we agree internally prior to sending out to the coalition.
1751	Could folks please provide any comments to Mike Day pronto so that Scott Govenar can start immediately to get the DA coalition on board?
1751	Scott, could you hold off until Mike gets and incorporates any internal comments?
1751	Thanks very much.
1751	Best, Jeff
1752	Thanks, Catherine.
1752	We've had a conversation with the PUC staffer and she's pretty ill-informed.
1752	We told her that we need specific details.
1752	I'll get back to you just as soon as (and if) I get them.
1752	Best, Jeff
1753	Here are some more details forwarded by our outside counsel.
1753	Best, Jeff
1754	Greetings Jess: I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco.
1754	I would like to discuss internally and think hard about this before we give any response to the staffer at the CPUC---not because we have any reason not to respond, but because this a problem created almost exclusively by the PUC, and I don't want to give the PUC the opportunity to shift bad decision making and actions onto us.
1754	There's a very easy fix to the situation.
1754	The Commission can reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago, and permit customers to return to utility service.
1754	I've forwarded all of the information to Catherine Woods and Roger Ponce.
1754	Let's discuss more internally when we've gathered up all the facts and then decide whether and how we choose to respond to the staffer at the PUC.
1754	My number's 415.782.7822.
1754	Feel free to give me a ring.
1754	Thanks very much Mike for helping to track down the info.
1755	Hey Buddy: See cover email to the Brulte letter that was sent to the Sacramento Teamcouple of weeks ago when I was in Houston.
1755	Might be a good place to startw.r.t.
1755	getting our "constructive" message out, though I'm sure that there'splenty of other things that needed to be added.
1755	Best, Jeff
1756	Greetings, kiddo.
1756	How's it going with this stuff.
1756	Seems a wee bit like "stop and start, repeat."
1756	Hang in there.
1756	You're doing a fantastic job.
1756	Best, Jeff
1757	Ken: could you call me at 415.782.7822 re: Loretta's talk tomorrow (I'll be in Sacramento).
1757	Thanks, Jeff "Ken Smith" Please respond to "Ken Smith"
1758	You are so sweet.
1758	Thanks so much.
1758	What's new?
1758	What are we doing on the Friday of Eldon's b-day?
1759	Greetings.
1759	How's things?
1760	You get this?
1760	Someone that I know forwarded it along to me.
1760	Know anything about it?
1760	Best, Jeff
1761	I'm scheduled to meet with Kari at 3:30 PST tomorrow, ostensibly to talk about demand buy-down.
1761	Also presume to message the letter from Steve Kean to the Senators and our solution (perhaps in advance of meetings, phone calls that might take place later in the week with legislative leaders).
1761	But would like to add to agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily call in the event folks have additional suggestions.
1761	Best, Jeff
1762	Thanks very much, Scott.
1762	Shouldn't be a big problem.
1762	Our buy-down auction would require the customer to commit to a fixed reduction over an extended period (for a price), and the reduction would have to be verifiable, i.e., the customer would need to have the equipment necessary to verify (which isn't a problem for large customers).
1762	Sounds like a misunderstanding on the part of the legislator and something that we should be able to talk through.
1762	I'll be there tomorrow.
1762	If it makes sense for me to meet with them, just let me know.
1762	Who's the legislator in charge of demand buy-down?
1762	Best, Jeff
1763	Thanks, Roger.
1763	We'll need to determine whether we've turned the customer back.
1763	Any help that you and Catherine can give in that regard is appreciated.
1763	Then we can decide if, and how, we choose to respond to the PUC staffer.
1763	Thanks very much for your help.
1763	Best, Jeff
1764	will call shortly.
1765	It's always darkest before the light (though it may not get light in our lifetimes).
1765	Looks great.
1765	Couple of points: 1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton (as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else, it seems), if it has the inkling.
1765	That's an egregious provision in ABx6.
1765	2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, "pay them their PX credits."
1765	I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to seek and get the money owed to us.
1765	We could seek the additional language, but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of attention, may be a preferable path.
1765	3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms Migden (ABx8?) that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.
1765	Anyone know about it?
1765	We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.
1765	Best, Jeff
1766	To Jim's last point.
1766	I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems to always be tied to this notion that "California is a net importer, even in the winter."
1766	I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.
1766	Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion: If California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.
1766	I'm struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable to Western power markets.
1766	I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years.
1766	To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.
1766	The basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the summer.
1766	Let's take two scenarios: 1) The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its peak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.
1766	Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.
1766	The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so.
1766	That is, during the winter peaking months, it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself.
1766	Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month, particularly if they're long.
1766	As such, at a minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors.
1766	2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load.
1766	Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking summer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking period.
1766	In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California closes its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.
1766	I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW (e.g., transmission costs).
1766	And again, I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry.
1766	But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks.
1766	With that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above): Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW is long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of power?
1766	Best, Jeff
1767	Christian: Could you let me know as soon as possible if 1) the proposed decision that I faxed you yesterday is go to go, i.e., adequately addresses our concerns regarding creditworthiness or if 2) we want to recommend some additional provisions?
1767	If we want to recommend additional provisions, could you let me know what those are?
1767	I want to make a run at getting this deal done at the CPUC ASAP,and would like to push Peevey to get Davis to have the PUC pass it out at their next meeting.
1767	But need to know if it's good as is or needs some tweeking.
1767	Thanks very much.
1767	Best, Jeff
1768	Thanks very much for getting back to us.
1768	So if I understand the bottom line: 1) the customer was mistakenly put back to SoCal (due to the dual service territory character of the customer's facilities), 2) the customer will be returned to our service, 3) the customer's contract with us expires on 5/31, and 4) the customer will have the option of re-signing with us, or returning to SoCalGas when the contracts ends on 5/31?
1768	If I've confused anything, please let me know.
1768	And thanks again for helping track down the info.
1768	Best, Jeff
1769	har-dee-har-har.
1769	I mean, will we be celebrating in some fashion.
1769	I'm scheduled to go to Houston--I'm not kidding--but if there's something planned, which I assume there is, then I'm going to cancel my trip to Houston, like pronto.
1769	Ironically, Jeff
1770	Eldon said that you were making dinner on Friday, the 9th, and that he was flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.
1770	Have you guys spoken in the last few months!?!?!?
1770	(kidding.) And don't worry about my birthday--that's not the issue.
1770	It's Eldon's 80th--that's huge.
1770	Friday is the 9th.
1770	So I'm just checking in to see what's up.
1770	My very strong inclination--for a variety of reasons, but Eldon's b-day is the biggest one--is to cancel.
1770	Signed, confused
1771	Thanks.
1771	It would of course be easiest to make the calls and say "pass it out now, as is," but if more is needed to fix the credit issue, want to be prepared to tell them how the decision needs to be modified.
1771	If it's fine as is, all the better.
1771	Best, Jeff
1772	Thanks again.
1773	Mike, Here's the answer.
1773	Please call me when you get a chance to discuss a response (if any).
1773	Best, Jeff
1774	I understand that there may be a need to give no quarter on this, but given the circumstances--i.e., we talk every day and time and resources are extremely tight--is it reasonable to temporarily suspend filling this thing out for the next 60-90 days?
1774	Lemme know.
1774	My sister just called and said that the earthquake in Seattle was 7.0.
1774	That's big.
1774	Best, Jeff
1775	Sandi: Apologies.
1775	I meant and forgot to mention on the 11:30 call that the pipeline group is having their annual customer meeting (VPs of large energy companies throughout the West and Midwest) at the Santa Barbara Biltmore on April 12th and 13th.
1775	They would very much like to get Bill Keese to speak (preferably on the morning of the 13th, but the morning of the 12th would work as well).
1775	They'd like Bill to discuss the energy situation in California.
1775	They can cover however much of Bill's costs--if any--that the State of California allows to be covered.
1775	The folks at the pipeline group asked if we could make the contact with Bill and see if he's available and willing.
1775	Given your relationship, thought you might be able to check.
1775	They're anxious to get someone lined up as soon as possible.
1775	Feel free to contact Laura Lantefield directly at 402.398.7080.
1775	Thanks very much for the help.
1775	Best, Jeff
1776	Hi.
1776	I was trying to get a fix on whether there's something going on on the Friday of your Dad's b-day to see if I need to cancel the Houston trip.
1776	What do you think?
1777	Apologies.
1777	The first version incorrectly left in some DWR credit issues and had a couple of other goofs.
1777	Please discard and review and comment on this one.
1777	But if you've already reviewed the other, no worries, since the attached is extremely similar (less the couple of goofs).
1777	Thanks.
1778	Lad can play both roles pretty effectively.
1779	I'm assuming that the IOUs wouldn't be dumb enough to recommend something that would have an adverse effect on DWR's creditworthiness, but wanted to make sure you had a chance to review--just in case they're not as smart as I assume.
1779	Thanks.
1779	Jeff
1780	I'd LOVE to.
1780	Have class from 6:30 to 9:30......
1781	Minor edit.
1781	No big deal.
1781	Check it out.
1782	Thanks so much for responding, Sally.
1782	Very interested in exploring the possibilities with you.
1782	Greatly appreciated.
1782	Wow, that's the only other Jeff Dasovich I've ever heard of.
1782	No kidding.
1782	Referred to you by Lee Green.
1782	Don't yet have soil test or temp profiles, but am in the process of figuring out how to get them done.
1782	Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated.
1782	I'll be around the weekend of March 10th.
1782	If that works for you, great; otherwise, we can try another date.
1782	Again, can't thank you enough for responding.
1782	I don't know where it'll lead, but I've got a hunch that it just might work out.
1782	Enjoy drinking your wine (had the syrah recently) and very much look forward to meeting you.
1782	All the best, Jeff Please respond to pacstar
1783	FYI.
1783	Well if she ain't sweet....
1784	FYI.
1784	Looks like what we suspected is about to launch, i.e., an orchestrated effort by Davis to go after the suppliers.
1784	Just found out the following from Sue Mara, who attended the ISO board meeting today: The ISO is scheduled to release a "report" today claiming that suppliers are price gouging.
1784	The California AG has subpoena-ed generator-members of the WPTF---very extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun.
1784	Likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon.
1784	Best, Jeff
1785	What kind of contract?
1786	Laura: Thanks so much for including me on the list.
1786	Quick question: Which committe is this and who's on the committe?
1786	Is there an agenda for the meeting on the 5th?
1786	Thanks again.
1786	Best, Jeff
1787	Yes, I would like to attend if that would be possible.
1787	Thanks very much for the info.
1787	I assume that the folks on the committe are the energy managers of the companies (like K.C. Mares, who I met when I met with Justin a few weeks ago)?
1787	Jeff
1788	Here is the final version.
1788	I'll bring copies with me tomorrow to Sacramento and can drop them off at Hedy's office.
1788	I meet with Kari Dohn at 10 AM and will be attending the AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting at 1:30.
1788	I can drop off copies before I head out for the Dohn meeting.
1788	If there's anything else, just let me know.
1788	Thanks.
1788	Best, Jeff
1789	In that case, definitely baloney.
1790	Thanks, Steve.
1790	That helps clear things up enormously (at least in my little mind).
1790	Best, Jeff
1791	Bill: In order to assess, I need to understand the structure.
1791	What's the contract structure look like now?
1791	What are we proposed to change, including counterparties?
1791	What part of the existing contract required any PUC approval and why?
1791	What is Edison saying needs to happen at the PUC?
1791	Thanks.
1791	Best, Jeff
1792	Greetings Justin and Laura: As we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the Legislature to try to remove the prohibition on Direct Access included in Hertzberg's AB1X and recently signed by the Governor.
1792	Simply put, it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the business community communicates clearly and unequivocally and vociferously to the Legislature that Direct Access is a priority for business, and that the Legislature must amend AB1X to permit Direct Access.
1792	I've attached the media plan developed by the PR firm that's working with ARM (Alliance for Retail Markets) to increase the focus on the need to re-instate Direct Access.
1792	The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues to develop) around the Direct Access issue.
1792	In order to succeed, it is critical to get as many members of the Silicon Valley Manufactures' Group to join in the effort and participate actively, particularly in the media effort.
1792	My colleague Sue Mara has been a key player in the ARM coalition and in the development of the medial effort.
1792	She can provide you with any information and/or assistance that you need and can also get you in contact with Edelman, the PR firm directing the media effort.
1792	Sue's number is 415.782.7802.
1792	Her email is smara@enron.com.
1792	And, as always, you can contact me at any time (415.782.7822).
1792	Looking forward to any participation that you folks can offer.
1792	All the best, Jeff
1793	whaddya mean?
1794	FYI.
1795	You're very sweet.
1795	Thank you so much.
1796	Do we want to position this as "let the market do it, cuz it can do it better than Socalgas; but the market ain't going to do anything if you don't create an hospitable investment climate?"
1797	Hi Laura: Thanks very much.
1797	If it works for you, I'd be happy to come to your office on either day to meet and catch up.
1797	Just let me know.
1797	I can be flexible.
1797	Have fun in DC.
1797	Best, Jeff
1798	Laura: FYI Jeff
1799	Dude: Thanks very much.
1799	Looking forward to tonite.
1799	You won't believe this--this morning, I heard on the radio that today--that's right, today--is Doc Watson's birthday.
1799	Killer...
1799	Best, Jeff
1800	Just talked to Peevey.
1800	He told me that he and Freeman personally worked with Bilas on Bilas' draft decision--the decision designed to make CDWR creditworthy and keep the PUC from touching Direct Access until the Legislature has a chance to fix the AB1X prohibition.
1800	I made the pitch re: decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy issue and the Commission needs to vote it out immediately.
1800	He said he agreed but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process generally, and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is greased to get voted out at the next Commission meeting.
1800	He said that he's going to be talking to the Governor this afternoon and will push the issue with him.
1800	I asked him to keep me updated.
1800	He said that he would.
1800	I told him that it wasn't helpful that the Governor named names in New York regarding alleged agreements about "haircuts," particularly when folks are trying to negotiate deals with DWR.
1800	He wasn't aware of that and asked me to fax him the Merril press, which I did.
1800	I'll also fax him our letter supporting the Bilas decision.
1800	Best, Jeff
1801	Thanks very much, Laura.
1801	If it's appropriate, I would like to attend?
1801	Just let me know.
1801	Thanks very much.
1801	Best, Jeff
1802	i send her just about everything.
1802	if she wasn't on distribution list, it was an oversight that i'll correct, fellow "responder" on the upcoming panel in best,
1803	Sandi: Apologies.
1803	Inadvertently didn't include you on first distribution.
1803	Best, Jeff
1804	in office mon-wed travel to houston on thurs in houston on friday
1805	Yes, I'll be in Houston this week.
1805	We could discuss there.
1805	But might be useful to discuss tomorrow when you return.
1805	I'm available.
1805	Seems useful to try to get a start on it tomorrow.
1805	You available for a quick call?
1805	My schedule's pretty flexible.
1805	Best, Jeff
1806	Apologies.
1806	At a loss to figure out how in the heck your name disappeared from this mega-list.
1807	Mike (Day): As you know from the work with the DA coalition, UC/CSU is extremely interested in ensuring that the prohibition on DA included in AB1X gets "fixed" in SB27X.
1807	Of couse we'd ideally like to make sure that the language providing the "fix" makes it crystal clear that customers retain the right going forward.
1807	There's some concern that the "fix" language that's been floating around thus far needs some tightening to wring out the ambiguities.
1807	In that regard, Mike Smith is going to try to craft some language and forward it to you.
1807	We'll need to try to get Mike (Smith's) language into the draft that you're putting together based on last Friday's meeting, preferably before you circulate the next draft to the DA coalition.
1807	Mike Smith, I'll assume that you'll contact Mike Day directly, but Mike (Day), if there's any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
1807	Thanks very much.
1807	Best, Jeff
1808	Brilliance begets brilliance.

1812	FYI.
1812	UC Pioneers Conservation Two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch When the state's energy crisis hit, the University of California was not caught with its fans running full blast.
1812	Across the nine-campus UC system, $65 million has been spent over two decades on energy-saving devices, including new lighting, variable speed fans, even a system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers.
1812	So, with Gov. Gray Davis calling for every California household and business to cut electricity use by 10 percent, UC offers a good model of conservation.
1812	Despite rapid growth in the 178,000-student system in recent years, most campuses have held electricity consumption steady, and the university will net about $75 million in savings from the projects.
1812	"We are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion. They have been working on this agenda since the oil embargo," said Gary Matteson, UC director of energy and utilities planning.
1812	But UC will need to do more.
1812	Facing a 146 percent increase in the cost of natural gas -- which powers the co-generators that produce electricity -- the university is now asking the state for $217 million to fund additional conservation efforts.
1812	That way, UC could offset the increase in natural gas prices.
1812	As a state institution, UC has to reduce its electricity consumption by 8 percent of its base load -- which is 334 megawatts at peak -- and by 20 percent during Stage 2 alerts, when state electricity reserves fall below 5 percent.
1812	UC has already exceeded the 8 percent reduction and Matteson said he expects the system to be ready to meet the 20 percent goal by June 1, before the summer peak hits.
1812	Like little cities, the campuses run around the clock, but laboratory lights that used to blaze continuously are now going dark when not needed, those in hallways have been dimmed or shut off when possible and the thermostats have been lowered.
1812	"I almost stumble through some of the hallways, it is so dark," said Keith Roberts, energy engineer at UC Davis.
1812	"There are a lot of people who really want to help out. We are trying to do what we can without impacting the mission of the campus."
1812	At many campuses, daily e-mail alerts remind students, as well as employees, to open their window shades to light and warm their rooms and offices during the day, and to shut off computers and lights when they are not in use.
1812	At UC Berkeley, freshman Jon Clingan, 18, said signs have been posted in the hallways and bathrooms of the residence halls, imploring students to save electricity in their rooms and even to cut short their showers.
1812	"I try to keep my light off as long as possible until it is just not possible to do work," Clingan said.
1812	In addition to conserving energy, UC protected itself against skyrocketing electricity prices by signing a four-year contract in 1998 -- along with the California State University system -- with Enron Corp to buy electricity at the 1996 rate minus 5 percent.
1812	In 1986, systemwide co-generation plants were installed to produce sufficient energy for most university buildings and to pump an additional 20 megawatts into the state's electricity grid.
1812	That approach saved most of the UC campuses from falling victim during the state's rolling blackouts -- although UC Santa Cruz went dark one day in January because its co-generation plant was out.
1812	MARKET PRICES AHEAD Still, UC officials are asking the Legislature for extra money, warning that a systemwide natural gas bill is expected to rocket from $26 million last year to a projected $64 million this year.
1812	A contract for low-priced gas is expiring and UC will soon find itself paying market prices.
1812	That means UC will face having to raise dormitory fees, cut back on night and weekend classes and turn down the air conditioners in the summer, leaving classrooms sweltering.
1812	Saying that that would be unacceptable, Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D- Santa Clara, chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, called a hearing on the issue last month.
1812	"I really wanted to hear how they were going to cope with the crisis," she said.
1812	UC is already negotiating with the State Department of Finance to get about $217 million for an additional list of energy efficiency and conservation projects that could save 149 megawatts within three years.
1812	Reducing electricity means reducing reliance on natural gas.
1812	John Baca, manager of the policy and strategic planning program for the Office of Energy Assessments at the state Department of General Services, said higher education facilities tend to consume a lot of energy.
1812	"They have experiments that just can't go off and they have a lot of flue hoods, and things like that," Baca said.
1812	"They have to have power for a lot of different things all the time, so there is still a lot of potential at the higher education level. But I think UC has done a really fantastic job."
1812	SYSTEMWIDE CHANGES The efforts have been made across the system.
1812	UC Santa Cruz undertook an extensive conservation project that reduced electricity consumption in academic and administrative buildings by 6 percent.
1812	UC Davis has spent about $15 million on conservation renovations during the past 10 years, saving at least $3 million a year.
1812	At UC Berkeley, more than $6 million has been spent since 1986 to improve energy efficiency on the campus by modifying and reducing light fixtures in older buildings, installing centrally located automated controls that can run heating and cooling equipment on a flexible schedule, and improving efficiency around heating pipes.
1812	"Our usage is only 3 percent above what it was in 1972-73," said Paul Black, a senior engineer in the UC Berkeley physical plant department.
1812	"And if you think of all the computers added and also the air conditioners we have added to cool computer rooms and labs, that is good."

1813	can you send the ackerman email around?
1813	calger wasn't there; left him a voice mail.
1813	expect to hear back shortly.
1813	Best, Jeff
1814	FYI--Davis includes us as one of the companies he signed up.
1814	I'm only aware of a 30-day deal with an option to extend for 5 years (option ends toward the end of the month, as I understand it).
1814	Not aware of any other deals we've done with DWR at this time, though others are on the table----DWR's creditworthiness remains an issue.
1814	Best, Jeff Davis announces first round of long-term power contracts DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer Monday, March 5, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers of two financially ailing utilities, Gov. Gray Davis announced Monday.
1814	The deals will supply an average of nearly 8,900 megawatts per year for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers over the next 10 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been paying on the costly spot market, Davis said in a written statement.
1814	One megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 households.
1814	For the first five years, the contracts provide power at an average price of $79 per megawatt hour, about 75 percent below recent costs on the spot electricity market, Davis said.
1814	The price drops to an average of $61 per megawatt hour, about 80 percent below spot prices, he said.
1814	``These agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution,'' Davis said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday afternoon in Los Angeles.
1814	``The provide reliability at a reasonable price.'' Some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant construction, adding an estimated 5,000 megawatts to the state grid within the next two years, some by this summer, Davis said.
1814	The contracts amount to 75 percent of the long-term deals the Davis administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an estimated $10 billion over a decade to buy power for Edison and PG&E customers.
1814	Davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift California out of its energy crisis.
1814	Negotiations have taken longer than expected, however, as his administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should pay.
1814	The Davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot market, where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices.
1814	On Friday, the state released another $500 million to continue making such purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities, bringing its spending so far to some $3.2 billion since early January.
1814	The agreements announced Monday include more than 20 power suppliers, including electricity giants Duke Energy, Calpine, Dynegy, Enron and Reliant.
1814	Davis declined to release details on individual contracts.
1814	Duke Energy said it has reached a $4 billion, nine-year agreement to sell electricity to the state.
1814	The memorandum of understanding calls for Duke to provide 550 megawatts starting next Jan. 1.
1814	That's enough power for roughly 550,000 households.
1814	That amount would rise to 800 megawatts Jan. 1, 2003, enough electricity for the equivalent of 800,000 households.
1814	The contract would continue through ``We believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that direction,'' Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said in a written statement.
1814	The state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of Edison and PG&E.
1814	Both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power.
1814	California plans to recover those costs by issuing $10 billion in revenue bonds in May, with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper, long-term power contracts.
1814	In addition to the long-term contracts, the Department of Water Resources has reached 11 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the day-ahead market, cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the real-time market, Davis said.
1814	A Stage 1 power alert was called Monday morning with reserves threatening to drop to 7 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports, said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the Independent System Operator.
1814	The ISO manages the state's power grid.
1815	I'm worried about the commercial guys---they're in a "rock no boats" mode in anticipation of perhaps signing the 5-year deal.
1815	I'll let you know what Calger sez soon as he gets back to me.
1815	He's in a meeting.
1815	Best, Jeff
1816	Yes.
1817	Principles with edits received thus far.
1817	Best, Jeff
1818	hi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1818	gigi, o, gigi, you won't believe this.
1818	i gave a talk on california at the plaza hotel in nyc about a month or so ago and guess who spoke on the panel before me?!?!?
1818	you guessed it.
1818	daniel william hissself.
1818	can't wait to tell you about it.
1818	i, too, want to catch up.
1818	how's coffee early tomorrow morning---like 8:30 am work for you.
1818	otherwise, i'm in heewwwston for the rest of the week.
1818	hey, we each had big birthdays--congratulations.
1818	another decade well lived.
1818	look forward to seeing you real soon.
1818	best,
1819	Concur with Harry, i.e., continue to take the position that the program should be available to all.
1819	When I was in Sacramento last week at a meeting of all the players, the utilities argument against including DA customers was based on "double dipping," i.e., payments to customers/ESPs for curtailment, plus payments to customers/ESPs for the re-sale of power to the ISO resulting from the curtailment.
1819	The utilities "double dipping" argument is off base.
1819	As important, the state is facing the threat of frequent and severe supply disruptions this summer and it needs to take each and every step necessary to try to avoid them.
1819	The utility position (apart from being incorrect) seems pretty short-sighted given the dire circumstances.
1819	So seems clear that California should include both DA and bundled customers in the program.
1819	Best, Jeff
1820	No rush, but thought I'd throw this out there just ot get the ball rolling: Looks at this point like any of the presentation dates work for me, so I don't necessarily have a preference.
1820	Options for project (and I'm really just throwing stuff out there to stimulate thought): Analyze AOL/Time Warner merger My company, Enron, is accused by some analysts of being nothing more than a Merrill-Lynch, or a Morgan-Stanley, or a Goldman-Sachs, etc. These analysts claim that we should therefore trade at multiples that are in line with the investment houses.
1820	We differ in that view (for a lot of reasons that I won't go into here).
1820	Might be interesting to analyze strategies, differences, etc. Anyway, just some thoughts to get the ball rolling.
1820	I'm open to just about anything.
1820	Best, Jeff
1821	Thanks, Steve: Alan and Jim might want to join in the fun.
1821	Does 1PM west coast time work for folks to have a brief kick-off discussion of how we might assess the costs of a "California for Californians" energy policy?
1821	Best, Jeff
1822	Just let me know when you'd like to chat.
1822	Best, Jeff
1823	tomorrow at 9 it is.

1823	see you then.
1824	FYI.
1825	FYI.
1825	Appears that all went well, even though our communications remain a wee bit bumpy.
1825	Sometimes outcome is the most important thing.
1825	Signed, Cuddles
1826	Glad to hear that it all worked out.
1826	Have a great conference.
1826	Best, Jeff
1827	This is separate from our 2 PM UC/CSU meeting right?
1827	Apologies.
1827	Difficult to keep it al straight these days.
1827	Best, Jeff
1828	No need to apologize.
1828	Thanks for bio.
1828	Sorry about the long-winded voice mail.
1828	Look forward to call from McKinsey.

1829	If you need anything else, just let me know.
1829	Best, Jeff
1830	Funny.
1830	I sent it before you sent your note, I think.
1830	You will have a very difficult time touching base with her.
1830	Good luck.
1830	Best, Jeff
1831	Thank you.
1831	I'm not getting it.
1831	Please continue sending if you can.
1831	Thanks very much.
1831	Jeff
1832	Please distribute to rest of Sac team.
1832	Thanks, Jeff
1833	Also might add that it conflicts directly with and is likely to thwart Gov's efforts to dramatically reduce demand this summer and avoid rolling black outs.
1833	Seems like legislators would benefit from more information, along the lines of the points that Harry makes, to better understand that this bill would only add to the problems.
1833	Best, Jeff
1834	Yes, I will be joining folks for dinner.
1835	FYI.
1835	xoxoxoxoxo
1836	Note size of folks participanting as reflected in email distribution list.
1836	See attachment, which shows "official" list of coalition members and bullet points they're passing along to legislators.
1836	Note UC is on the list.
1836	Mike: UC's participation in this coalition can be fairly characterized as "very active."
1836	Best, Jeff
1837	well, wouldn't you know it.
1837	i now have a 9 am meeting.
1837	but i've opened up for lunch.
1837	any chance of doing lunch?
1837	i could also do coffee in the afternoon.
1837	(i don't leave for hewwston now until Thursday at noon).
1837	My apologies.
1837	Hope one of these other times work?
1837	your pal,
1838	DA coalition's leg language.
1838	Letter supporting Bilas from subset of coalition.
1838	Coalition list to follow.
1839	howzabout 11 or 11:15 at the coffee place?
1840	I think we may have decided to start at 11 AM?
1840	I have a 1 PM meeting.
1840	Possible to start at 11?
1840	Best, Jeff
1841	I'll be in air (to Houston) at that time tomorrow.
1841	Harry can you attend EES (San Diego team call)?
1841	Best, Jeff
1842	Sue Mara was correct on the call yesterday.
1842	While the PUC meets regularly on Thursdays, it appears they are having a meeting today at which the "Bilas Alternative" is up for a vote.
1842	Our information is that there is some likelihood that the decision will be approved----but please don't hold your breath.
1842	We'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it.
1842	Best, Jeff
1843	The notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure Roger, and could likely be correct.
1843	But we need to determine whether we can get what we need by doing a "less precise" annual versus a "monthly."
1843	Seems that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it.
1843	Thoughts?
1843	Best, Jeff
1844	Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit and rate issues.
1844	Few points: Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies.
1844	Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need refinement (to be sure).
1844	The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios.
1844	Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however.
1844	The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly.
1844	I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are.
1844	These are key inputs and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly.
1844	For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the conceptual model in word format, rather than excel.
1844	It will be simple to translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).
1844	Best, Jeff
1845	great.
1845	see you there.
1846	of course.
1847	The Commission just voted out one half of the "Bilas Alternate."
1847	The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass through DWR costs to customers.
1847	However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the Bilas language on Direct Access.
1847	The decision therefore did NOT include the Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct Access prohibition.
1847	Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of arrogance."
1847	The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
1847	That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the prohibition any time soon.
1847	Best, Jeff
1848	Tell me it ain't so, Bob.
1848	Hostile would be a gross understatement.
1848	If you would like to chat further let me know.
1848	Best, Jeff
1849	FYI.
1849	I've notified Bob and Mike about Carl Wood's proclivities.
1849	Best, Jeff
1850	I'm in SF.
1850	I'll be here.
1851	It continues to be fun, fun, fun out here.
1851	Give a call and I can Best, Jeff
1852	FYI.
1853	This version includes Jim's and Ken's suggestions.
1853	Best, Jeff
1854	This copy should correct all of the the typos identified on the call this morning.
1854	Apologies if I've missed any.
1854	Best, Jeff
1855	Thanks, Steve.
1855	Alan, any word from Tim re: resource availability?
1855	See you all in Houston.
1855	Best, Jeff
1856	No. The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.
1856	So all this means is that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is nothing before the commission to implement.
1856	Sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it, though.
1856	Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and therefore can't do an update call with edward's?
1856	i can, however, do it on best,
1857	i won't be in class tonite.
1857	i'm open, too, but to tell you the truth, mark, the thought of comparing us and european accounting standards/practices makes me break out in a rash.
1857	if there's any way that we can focus on strategy, valuation, or other sorts of financial analyses that we've focused on in the course, that would be preferable from my perspective.
1857	best, Jeff
1858	Wow.
1858	Have a great trip.
1858	I'll anxiously await your return.
1858	Best, Jeff
1859	Thank you.
1860	This, my friends, sounds ominous.....
1861	FYI.
1861	Appears that the Davis administration has thrown down the gauntlet, looking to position itself in a way that will allow it to blame the FERC/Bush administration for California's electricity crisis, unless FERC agrees to the ISO's price cap plan.
1861	Best, Jeff
1862	Katie: Thanks so much for the info.
1862	Do you have the call-in number for the ISO call today?
1862	Best, Jeff
1863	What's the status of the DG bill?
1863	As I recall, Burton amended the bill in a way that explicitly prohibit diesel DG units from helping California avoid rolling black outs this summer.
1863	I believe the exclusion was made on grounds that running diesel would be too environmentally damaging?
1863	Could you provide a brief update?
1863	Is there anything in the bills that addresses the restrictions on the number of hours that these units are permitted to run?
1863	Thanks very much.
1863	Best, Jeff
1864	yes, monday works.
1865	FYI.
1866	Bill: As ususal, there's another crisis today.
1866	I'll be able to do the call, but we need to keep it brief.
1866	Apologies.
1866	What's the cal-in number?
1866	Thanks.
1866	Best, Jeff
1867	FYI.
1867	Should be of interest.
1867	Best, Jeff
1868	Janel & Co.: This is a group that we should try to tie into our PR efforts.

1869	Could you check on this.
1869	It should not apply to me.
1869	Thanks very much.

1870	Feds Hint at Power Bill Refunds Firms ordered to justify high rates David Lazarus and Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday, March 10, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Federal regulators warned power companies yesterday that they may have to refund $69 million to California ratepayers for charging unreasonable prices during recent electricity shortages.
1870	However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission left the door wide open for the unnamed 13 generators to avoid refund payments if they could offer "further justification" for why their rates should be considered fair.
1870	Consumer activists were quick to note that the commission's order was significant.
1870	"They have acknowledged for the first time that there has been abuse of the marketplace," said Doug Heller, assistant organizing director for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.
1870	"It's an acknowledgment that the power companies have been ripping us off."
1870	However, consumer groups also pointed out that the order -- issued late in the day -- was partly a political ploy intended to make the Bush administration look more sympathetic to California's plight.
1870	The proposed $69 million refund also represents only a fraction of the billions of dollars that utilities have had to pay due to rising electricity rates.
1870	The commission set narrow parameters for power charges in January that may be considered unreasonable.
1870	It is only considering charges above $273 per megawatt hour during the series of Stage 3 energy emergencies that threatened statewide blackouts.
1870	William Massey, the lone commissioner who voted against the order, noted that of 70,300 power transactions in January above $150 per megawatt hour, only about 13,000 fall within the regulatory commission's parameters for potential refunds.
1870	"This order is arbitrary, capricious and unlawful," he said.
1870	"Eighty percent of the transactions have been excluded from refunds."
1870	But commission Chairman Curt Hebert characterized the order as an aggressive effort to safeguard California consumers.
1870	"Today's refund order demonstrates the commission's commitment to ensure appropriate and reasonable prices in the wholesale electricity market given the supply and demand imbalance in California," he said in a statement.
1870	POWER COMPANIES NOT WORRIED Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, said power companies are not worried about the prospect of having to pay out millions of dollars in refunds.
1870	"The people I've talked to said they can justify the costs for a majority of hours where FERC said there may have been overcharges," he said.
1870	"We will be supplying supporting data to FERC," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston.
1870	"We commend them for doing this review. We believe this can be resolved and we can all move on."
1870	Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group representing out-of-state generators, said the commission's order shows that the system is working.
1870	"In my opinion, what has been identified is talking about potential refunds, " he said.
1870	"The generators will have a chance to justify their rates. I'm not terribly troubled by that."
1870	The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid, welcomed the order, although it said $69 million is lower than its own estimates of potential overcharges.
1870	The ISO had asked the commission earlier this month to review $350 million in January power charges that exceeded the regulatory commission's "soft cap" of $150 per megawatt hour.
1870	A soft cap means the price can exceed the prescribed amount as long as a supplier can justify the charge.
1870	REFUND ORDERS ARE RARE "The granting of refunds by FERC is not a common occurrence," said Charles Robinson, the ISO's general counsel.
1870	"We're treading new ground."
1870	Considering the potential ramifications of the order, the commission was oddly furtive in issuing its press release at the very end of the business week.
1870	The commission's press office already was closed by the time of the announcement, and the commissioners had left for the day.
1870	Reached at his home, Massey acknowledged that the commission was all but inviting power companies to bury the commission in paperwork to support their wholesale rates.
1870	"Welcome to the Hebert chairmanship," he said.
1870	Hebert was appointed head of the commission last month by President Bush.
1870	Since then, the regulatory commission and the Bush administration have maintained a largely hands-off approach to California's energy crisis.
1870	"We have said from the beginning that obviously the state of California has to address these problems and these challenges," U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said this week.
1870	E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com and Lynda Gledhill at
1871	Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary: I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.
1871	Is that correct?
1871	Thanks.
1871	Best, Jeff
1872	Greetings Mark: Here is the latest.
1872	ENA signed a short-term deal (5 -week term, I believe) with DWR that goes through the end of the month, at which time we have the option to extend the deal to a five-year term.
1872	We are discussing other longer-term deals, too.
1872	As Steve points out, we've had serious concerns regarding DWR's creditworthiness.
1872	(DWR, the Dept. of Water Resources, is the state agency that Davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power.) The problem has been simple and significant---while our brilliant Governor and Legislature gave DWR the authority to buy power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities, they neglected to t spell out how DWR would recover its costs of buying the power.
1872	Based on comments from us and other suppliers regarding the creditworthiness issue, the California PUC issued an order last week establishing that 1) the PUC would indeed pass DWR's power costs through to ratepayers and 2) the PUC would NOT second-guess (i.e., impose "reasonabless" standards) on any contracts signed by DWR as a condition of passing the costs through to ratepayers.
1872	With the CPUC decision (and other language that ENA's negotiated into the DWR contract), ENA is close to being comfortable signing the 5-year deal, even in the face of the FERC order.
1872	That's predominantly due to the fact that the power price in the 5-year deal would come in well under the $150/MWH threshold that FERC has set up for any sort of "refund review."
1872	But other things could crop up between now and the exercise date that could muck things up.
1872	I'll keep you posted on developments as they transpire.
1872	The big problem (as Steve notes) is that the State is on the verge of (some say hell bent on) taking over the entire electricity industry in California in perpetuity.
1872	Our original proposal focused on getting price volatility and the utilities' financial position back under control.
1872	Our contracting proposals have always been couched in the context of a temporary, stop-gap measure.
1872	That is, the state would do the minimum amount needed via contracts to stabilize prices while simultaneoulsly doing what was necessary to get de-regulation back on track in California.
1872	And once the situation had been righted, the State would as soon as possible exit the industry and let the market step back in. Unfortunately, command-and-control, anti-deregulation policymakers have taken hold of the agenda (with the blessing, seemingly, of the Governor), and are moving the state toward a "takeover" response.
1872	That's what we're actively opposing.
1872	If you have any questions, don't hesitate.
1872	Best, Jeff
1873	FYI.
1874	I have forwarded the info to Ken, and just spoke with him.
1874	Unless there are particular concerns, he will cover today's PR call with IEP.
1874	Otherwise, Sue or I can listen in at 1.
1874	Just let me know.
1874	Best, Jeff
1875	Dylan: Don't kill me.
1875	Is this case due today or next Monday?
1876	Roger.
1877	in all week.
1878	Thanks.
1878	Just wanted to make sure that I wasn't losing my mind......
1878	See you tonite.
1878	Best, Jeff
1879	Ken: Could you please write a very brief synopsis of what took place on the IEP PR call?
1879	Thanks very much.
1879	Best, Jeff
1880	Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, Inc. He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me to him.
1880	He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage investment in California's Enterprice Zones.
1880	Before I launch on the effort, just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.
1880	Thanks.
1880	Best, Jeff
1881	nope.
1882	Greetings Michelle: As we talked about it last week---and now that I'm back in the office, I'm having folks check to make sure that this is 100% accurate: Rates for core subscription customers are forecasted (I believe based on previous month's gas prices).
1882	Bills for core subscription customers are lagged (I believe by 30 days after consumption).
1882	The IOUs face a PBR mechanism that incents them to buy index (though they may have engaged in a modest amount of hedging).
1882	The California PUC issued an order (about 2 months ago) prohibiting noncore customers from switching to core subscription status.
1882	I'm back in the office today, and have folks checking on this.
1882	I need to pin down with certainty 1) the forecast period, and 2) the bill lag period.
1882	Will get back to you as soon as we get the info.
1882	If there's anything, just let me know.
1882	Best, Jeff
1883	Thank you.
1884	For what it's worth, here are my edits overlayed on Jim's, Harry's and whomever else provided comments.
1884	Best, Jeff
1885	Thanks, Scott.
1885	Did it include the "Sierra Pacific language" discussed on the call today?
1885	Best, Jeff P.S.
1885	Must be beautiful in Sacramento today.
1886	Same.
1886	Remember, it will soon be 135 degrees there.......
1887	Let it go.
1887	Ken is PR, and PR only.
1887	There are also calls where substance is discussed.
1887	Ken can't do that.
1888	Michelle: I've verified the information below.
1888	If you'd like to drill down deeper into any particular issue listed below, just let me know.
1888	Best, Jeff
1889	This sounds like a good idea.
1889	cc: Subject: Fwd: Review of FERC Analysis Gary Ackerman asked that the attached proposal from Ben Zycher be sent to the board.
1890	Are we supporting this (at least conceptually)?
1890	Seems important to have a tangible alternative to the horrible plan that the ISO Board/Staff is contemplating.
1890	Best, Jeff
1891	Greetings: This was reported on the news this morning.
1891	I'll see if I can retrieve anything off of our illustrious Governorn's web site.
1891	Any reports of it in Washington D.C. Thanks.
1891	Best, Jeff
1892	Sue: FYI--I'll be on the call and am covering.
1892	You're welcome to join.
1892	Best, Jeff
1893	Thanks, Rosalee.
1893	Best, Jeff
1894	Jim, et al: FYI.
1894	Lots of expansion plans going on, including TW.
1894	We can discuss further on the call.
1894	Expansions generally create some level of concern from shippers due to the fact that capacity to the boarder exceeds takeaway in California.
1894	It's particularly prickly at Wheeler, through which, I'm assuming, the Kern expansion will flow.
1894	We can discuss further on the call.
1894	Best, Jeff
1895	Thank you very much.
1895	Jeff
1896	Given everything that we've got on our plate, and the relative priority of the affiliate issue, and the fact that ARM and Wild Goose are involved, I would propose that we take a pass on this one.
1896	Thoughts?
1896	Best, Jeff
1897	It's a love fest!
1897	How goes it?
1898	Steve: Based on the note from Rosalee, and if you agree, I'm going to assign low priority to the issue.
1898	Jeff
1899	FYI.
1899	Silicon Manufacturer Group's comments on interruptible rates, etc.
1900	greetings.
1900	could you please call me at 415.782.7822.
1900	thanks.
1900	Jeff
1901	Prior to the UC/CSU blow-up, I would have said yes.
1901	Now my inclination is to lay low.
1901	But there may be other good reasons for getting out there.
1901	I just can't think of any....
1901	Best, Jeff
1902	Yes.
1903	Apologies, if I had your phone number, I'd have called you.
1903	I'm tied up for the next hour or so.
1903	If you give me your number, I can call you.
1903	Best, Jeff
1904	Jim: I'm assuming that I'll participate by phone in the meeting with Vicki and by phone in the meeting with Dave.
1904	That right?
1904	Best, Jeff
1905	can't wait to see the headlines: "congressman has hitman kill pregnant girlfriend, but supreme court ruling will allow him to vote on big budget bill this sunday anyway!"
1906	Ain't got one.
1906	Please call Scott Govenar at 916.448.8240 for info.
1907	Greetings folks: Great to see you (missed you, Donald) in Houston.
1907	Pleasesee attached.
1907	This guy's been after me for some time.
1907	I finally spoke withim and told him that I'd pass it along.
1907	I don't know who (if anyone) in Eis interested in OSS---I can't recall if it's a component of our architecture, or not.
1907	If there is someone who might be interested, could yforward this along?
1907	They can choose to follow up, or not.
1907	Hope all is weland hope to see you again very soon.

1908	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS UNVEILS 20/20 ENERGY REBATE PROGRAM FOR SUMMER 2001 California ratepayers will receive a 20 percent rebate on their summer electric bill if they cut back their electricity use by 20 percent over lassummer's levels under a new initiative unveiled by Governor Davis today.
1908	The "20/20" program, created by the Governor under executive order, is designed to help the state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer anreward consumers who significantly conserve energy.
1908	In addition, it couldsave the state up to $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount ofelectricity the state must buy during expensive summer peak periods.
1908	?=14 ?AThis program helps us take control of our own energy destiny,?=14 ?=0F_ Governor Davis said.
1908	?=14 ?AWe will save money and reduce costs to consumers.
1908	Theprogram will save up to 2,200 megawatts during the summer peak period.
1908	That?=14 ?vs power the state won?=14 ?vt have to purchase.
1908	Instead of paying exorbitant rates to out-of-state generators, I?=14 ?vd rather pay Califoconsumers to conserve.?=14 ?=0F_ The voluntary program is designed to cover all households and businesses inCalifornia.
1908	Under the Governor?=14 ?vs plan, customers will receive a 20 percent rebate on Summer 2001 bills if they achieve 20 percent or greater reductionin electricity consumption between June and September versus last year.
1908	Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on 20 percent reduction of total consumption, while commercial and industrial customer rebates will be basedon 20 percent reduction of peak load.
1908	Rebates will be issued at the end of the June-September period.
1908	The 20/20 program for Summer 2001 is a major component of Governor Davis?comprehensive energy efficiency and demand reduction program.
1908	Since JanuaryGovernor Davis has instituted conservation measures to help Californians conserve energy, including: Directing more than $800 million for programs to improve conservation andefficiency.
1908	Implementing aggressive conservation measures in state buildings, resultingin about 200 MW of savings during energy emergencies.
1908	Developing a comprehensive outreach and education campaign to reach businesses, organizations, and millions of California consumers.
1908	Partnering with other governmental entities, including school districts toensure that all 475 cities, 58 counties, and 8,300 schools in California reduce consumption.
1908	Adopting the strongest energy efficiency standards in the world for residential and non-residential buildings and appliances.
1908	Incorporating energy efficient, sustainable building designs in new statebuilding projects.
1908	Issuing 15 Governor's Executive Orders on energy.
1908	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CALIFORNIA RECEIVES FIRST PEAKER POWER PLANT PROPOSALS Governor Gray Davis announced that the first two proposals for power plantsto provide electricity at peak use times this summer have been received bythe California Energy Commission.
1908	"We are doing everything we can to greatly streamline the time it takes toget new generation up and running this summer," Governor Davis said.
1908	"Thesenew peaker proposals are examples of our determination to meet California'senergy challenge."
1908	A 90-megawatt plant called the Larkspur Energy Facility would be located inthe Otay Mesa area of the City of San Diego, at the corner of Harvest Roadand Otay Mesa Road.
1908	The second proposal is for the Indigo Energy Facility, a 135-megawatt plantthat would be located near an existing wind generating facility in the Cityof Palm Springs in Riverside County.
1908	The project is north of Interstate 10,on 19th Avenue, east of North Indian Avenue.
1908	Both projects use natural gas-fueled simple-cycle turbine generators equippwith state of the art air pollution control features.
1908	They are being proposby Wildflower Energy LP, a Houston, Texas-based company.
1908	The two projects are part of the Independent System Operator's reliability generation agreementsplanned to come on-line this summer.
1908	On February 8, 2001, Governor Davis directed the Energy Commission to use its emergency power plant permitting authority to permit new peaking and renewable power plants that can be on-line by July 31, 2001.
1908	The emergencypermitting authority extended to peaker projects that have ISO contracts anhave not begun the licensing process with the local jurisdictions.
1908	Peakerpower plants are simple cycle generators that can be constructed in a relatively small area and can readily connect to the existing electricitytransmission and natural gas system.
1908	The Energy Commission review of the proposed projects will include site tours and informational hearings in both local areas.
1908	Both applications are currently under review by Energy Commission staff for data adequacy.
1908	Oncethey are accepted as data adequate, the Energy Commission plans to expeditethe licensing process under its emergency process to approve projects in assoon as 21 days.
1908	Provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act do not apply to emergency power plant projects.
1909	Hi TJ.
1909	I forgot to request that last week's class be video-ed and I was wondering if someone else requested a video-taping.
1909	It was for Tasker's (E221?) class that meets on Thursdays.
1909	Thanks very much.
1909	Best, Jeff
1910	If you're referring to the conversation we had on today's call, it's actually a bill by Dede Alpert (sp?) that, if signed by the Governor, would cause demand to go up.
1910	Were you referring to that or something more general?
1910	Best, Jeff
1911	Greetings: Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.
1911	Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project on Thursday.
1911	I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and merger/valuation analysis.
1911	Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would like to do, I can certainly suck it up.
1911	Any thoughts?
1911	Best, Jeff
1912	absolutely NO need to be sorry, my dear.
1913	Kristen: My edits to the declaration.
1913	Best, Jeff
1914	Apologies.
1914	This is the correct version.
1914	Best, Jeff
1915	Soda Springs used to be a ski place (on the summit).

1918	Best, Jeff
1919	I'll be there.
1919	Thanks.
1920	We'll do our best.
1920	It'll be that much tougher w/out your help.
1920	Go to Giverny and paint some flower gardens for me.
1920	Best, Jeff
1921	Could be a move to create some negotiating leverage to persuade suppliers to take a haircut on the utilities undercollection.
1922	I'm having the same problem.
1922	She states on the izio site that that the cases are in the reader.
1922	they ain't.
1922	if anyone has them and could fax them to me at 415.782.7854, would be greatly appreciated.
1922	Best, Jeff Also, I like both ideas--Anil's and Mark's.
1922	I think that we could discuss at break and write it up then and turn in at beginning of second half of class.
1922	I'd lean a bit toward the Amazon suggestion, but could go either way.
1923	ok wiseguy, what the hell is an npvcd (why do i have the sinking feeling that i'll be sorry that i asked?).
1924	what specifically are you referring to?
1924	could you call me?
1924	i'm supposed to finalize, like now.
1924	thanks.
1925	Shoulda known.
1925	Congratulations.
1925	Thanks.
1925	Best, Jeff
1926	Kirsten: I've made two small changes.
1926	Moved the last sentence in paragraph 5 to the second sentence in paragraph 6.
1926	I think it makes more sense there.
1926	I've modified the last sentence in paragraph 10 to be what I think is a more accurate statement.
1926	It now reads: "It could instead prohibit further direct access arrangements as of the issuance of the order, when and if that occurs, or as of some other unspecified date in the future. " Let me know if you're comfortable with these changes and I'll print out the last page, sign and fax to your SF office.
1926	Best, Jeff
1927	thanks.
1927	did she hand out the second reader last thursday?
1928	FYI.
1928	As part of our defense against the UC/CSU suit, I've been asked to provide a declaration.
1928	The gist of the declaration is that the future of Direct Access in California is very uncertain.
1928	Best, Jeff
1929	FYI.
1929	In a letter to the California Legislature, the independent California Legislative Analyst is predicting significant shortages for this summer in excess of those predicted by the governor and the Cal Energy Commission.

1938	Any progress made?
1938	Best, Jeff
1939	See update on SBX47, below.
1940	FYI.
1941	That's the right story.
1941	Only thing I'd be prepared for is the following, "OK, Mr. Belden, California's stupid, they did it wrong, and your company told them so right at the outset. Does that give you the right to rob California's consumers and businesses blind?"
1941	Regarding the story with Peace quoted saying "we exported our stranded costs out of state."
1941	I recall seeing that story on several occasions.
1941	Karen, do we have someone who can do a search (lexis/nexis) and find those articles?
1941	Shouldn't be too tough.
1941	Best, Jeff
1942	you better be at home and not in the office.

1944	Hi Katie: Thought IEP folks might be interested.
1944	Best, Jeff Wednesday March 14, 12:22 pm Eastern Time US Senate rejects California utility bankruptcy measure By Patrick Connole WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid to force California utility companies to repay power generators for electricity they bought under a federal government sales order, even if utilities go bankrupt.
1944	In a motion on the Senate floor, lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled California utilities.
1944	The utilities in question are PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) Southern California Edison.
1944	The amendment was sponsored by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.
1944	Proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the federally-owned Bonneville Power Administration and other Northwest utilities from unfair rate increases due to the California energy crisis.
1944	``I don't think it's fair for consumers in other Western states to get caught holding the bag if California utilities take our power and then run into bankruptcy court to avoid their debts,'' Wyden said.
1944	``The Northwest has been more than a good neighbor to California during this crisis,'' he said.
1944	Interestingly, the California Senate delegation was split on the matter.
1944	Democrat Dianne Feinstein opposed the amendment, while fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer supported it.
1944	Feinstein called the proposal a ``dangerous amendment'' that would create two classes of creditors and ``probably force an involuntary bankruptcy.'' The broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the Senate by the end of the week.
1944	Separately, talks between California and its three investor owned utilities on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued this week with no deal in sight.
1944	The state is negotiating with PG&E and Edison, along with Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric.
1944	The deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into PG&E and SoCal Edison to keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $13 billion in red ink since last spring, paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market.
1944	PG&E and SoCal Edison, under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment with market deregulation, have been able to pass on to their retail customers only a fraction of their power purchase costs.
1945	thanks.
1945	it's too complicated for such a simple mind.
1945	i'm gonna take a pass.
1945	how's things?
1946	Jennifer: I'm on a call with Delainey that just got convened, which means that I might be delayed till 11:45.
1946	Unfortunately, Harry's on vacation.
1946	I'll call in just as soon as I get done with Delainey.
1946	Also, I was on a call with Eric yesterday, during which I went over the S.D.
1946	legislation, so he should be fairly up to speed.
1946	I'll get on just as soon as I can.
1946	Best, Jeff
1947	if i try to think about one more thing, my head will explode.
1948	cute.
1949	FYI.
1949	There is a great catalogue of the legislation currently pending attached as an appendix to the leg analyst report that I distributed yesterday.
1949	Best, Jeff
1950	Well done.
1950	One other point: If the PUC rules on the 27th that the rate freeze is not going to end retroactively, that should put Ken Lay in a much stronger position to negotiate with Glynn on reaching a deal on payment.
1950	Best, Jeff
1951	Nokia Expects to Meet Earnings Forecast Despite Lowered Sales, Industry Outlook Dow Jones Newswires HELSINKI, Finland -- Despite market conditions that have cut into its sales growth, Nokia Corp. said Thursday that it expects to meet its earnings target for the first quarter of 2001, thanks to better-than-anticipated profit margins.
1951	Nokia estimates it is likely to earn 19 European cents a share in the first quarter, in line with estimates it provided in January.
1951	Nokia's shares received a boost from the statement, rising 2.60 euros, or 11%, to 27.15 euros in early-afternoon trading in Helsinki.
1951	In midday trading in the U.S., shares of Nokia were up $3.20, or 15%, to $25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
1951	The company said it expects year-on-year sales growth in its networks division during the first quarter to be 30% to 35%, and 15% to 20% in the mobile-handsets division.
1951	Total sales growth is expected to be around 20%, the company said.
1951	That is lower than the 25% to 30% sales growth the company forecast in January, when it released full-year results for 2000.
1951	The company said it has had to confront "difficult market conditions," particularly in the U.S. "We feel confident about our strengths and our performance during the early months of the year," Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Jorma Ollila said.
1951	"Despite the more difficult market conditions, we have been able to show good progress. We expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole, with better-than-anticipated margins."
1951	As a result of the tougher conditions, Nokia said it now expects global handset sales for 2001 to be between 450 million and 500 million units.
1951	It had previously forecast a range of 500 million to 550 million units, saying sales near the bottom end were more likely.
1951	1Motorola Announces More Job Cuts In Wireless-Phone Handset Business (March 2Ericsson Issues Profit Warning Amid Sagging Economy, Sales (March 13) 3Ericsson to Outsource Handset Sector to Stem Losses in Consumer Goods (Jan. Just last year, manufacturers were expected to sell about 650 million cellphones world-wide in 2001, but the industry is slumping as many consumers delay buying or upgrading their phones. Nokia's statement comes three days after Swedish rival Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson warned that it expected a substantial loss in the first quarter because of slowdowns in both its handset and networks businesses. And Motorola Inc. of the U.S. said Tuesday that it will slash 7,000 jobs in its cellphone- and pager-manufacturing business, and will take a still-unspecified charge against first- and second-quarter earnings. Including the latest cuts, Motorola has set plans to eliminate 18,000 jobs since December, or 12% of its 147,000-member work force. Ericsson, meanwhile, has taken the unusual step of deciding to outsource its entire phone production to a third party -- a major retreat by a company once famous for manufacturing the most-sophisticated cellular phones in the world. Nokia said it has reacted to the changing market conditions by accelerating programs to improve efficiency and cut costs, but it didn't provide details. The company also said it has widened its market share in the handset market above the 32% it achieved in 2000. And it said its own stock levels, as well as the stock levels of Nokia phones already shipped to stores, are lower than at the end of 2000. "More challenging times like these test your mettle as a company," Mr. Ollila said. "We believe that truly great companies emerge from challenging times much stronger." The company said it would comment further on its performance on April 20, when it releases first-quarter results. URL for this Article: Hyperlinks in this Article:
1952	you need to have a chat with ken.
1953	David: Thanks so much.
1953	I'd almost given up hope.
1953	I will be distributing the proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across the nation.
1953	Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard to try to bring people together.
1953	I'll be in touch soon.
1953	Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss it further.

1956	Does that mean that you're finally freed from that hairball?
1957	FYI.
1957	Also see proposals regarding gas.
1957	Best, Jeff
1958	do we really not know who is speaking on our behalf at the event in LA?
1959	probably Dave Parquet........................(kidding! if we can't laugh, what do we have left, by god.)
1960	Greetings: Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.
1960	We looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities.
1960	We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved.
1960	The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a couple of months ago.
1960	When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot of large ("noncore") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs.
1960	In response, SoCalGas filed with the Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.
1960	The Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.
1960	The Commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.
1960	Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to respond to the following: Have you "stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract. If your company has stopped or intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the non-core customer(s) the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts."
1960	There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in California.
1960	Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've expired, etc. Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?
1960	Thanks.
1960	Best, Jeff

1967	Great points.
1967	Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.
1967	That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this "study" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it.
1967	I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate "To de-regulate or not."
1967	As such, I wouldn't see issues like "PJM or APX" or "competitive default supplier or not," or "divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets" being the focus.
1967	That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in "Round 2," once the initial debate over "deregulate or not" is won.
1967	To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, "right" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably.
1967	And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment.
1967	In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot.
1967	Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on "how to do it," but that would not be the emphasis.
1967	In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of "to deregulate or not," and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study.
1967	I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the "go/no go" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.
1967	Best, Jeff
1968	Do we know what case this request has been made in and if we're one of the 5 listed?

1969	State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.
1969	State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging $49 million a day.
1969	That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.
1969	The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, which purchases power on behalf of the state.
1969	It was handed to a group of lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much California is spending on power purchases.
1969	Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw it.
1969	"I don't think it was a surprise," said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- Redding.
1969	Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.
1969	For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education programs and transportation projects.
1969	The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in Davis' proposed budget.
1969	Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the utilities become financially stable.
1969	The watch list typically precedes a credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans to rise.
1969	"This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that tracks state spending.
1969	"Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look like in the future."
1969	The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour.
1969	The smallest day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per megawatt hour.
1969	Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.
1969	"That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time," he said.
1969	"Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be."
1969	The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.
1969	Maviglio said if generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could force up the price the next day.
1969	But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right to know how its money way being spent.
1969	"People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on," he said.
1969	"We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces."
1969	Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by Davis.
1969	The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers.
1969	The governor's office has sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional money was needed.
1969	Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water Resources document.
1969	Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a house of cards.
1969	The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds.
1969	The bonds will be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every month.
1969	Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage?
1969	Gov. Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to hear it.

1978	Hi Dale: Please call me to discuss your question.
1978	(415.782.7822) Customers could try to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.
1978	There were other forms of "bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.
1978	Give me a call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).
1978	Glad to talk to you on Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire any follow up.
1978	Best, Jeff
1979	Agreed.
1980	thank you very much for dinner last nite.
1980	really nice of you.

1980	great to see you guys.
1980	really something about eldon's solo.
1980	would have liked to see it.
1980	plz make sure that he tells about it next time.
1980	and don't worry, we'll get the luggage thing worked out.
1980	why don't you and i do the planning on that one.
1980	what's the chance of you dropping of the "community bag," or the wine box with me on Friday nite and i can just check it in as mine?

1989	Thanks, Scott.
1989	Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev: Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort underway in San Diego.
1989	Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., He'd like Erki to be the contact person.
1989	Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert?
1989	Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off.
1989	Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward.
1989	Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers.
1989	As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy.
1989	Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.
1989	Best, Jeff
1990	hi.
1990	been trying to call you, but you're not answering.
1990	call me at 505.6633.
1991	Greetings: Sent you a project proposal last Thursday on behalf of Dasovich, Guinney, Sama and Vavrek and just wanted to make sure that you received it.
1991	Could you let me know?
1991	Thanks very much.
1991	Best, Jeff
1992	just got word that my prof's sick, so i don't have class tonite.
1993	Marty: Thanks for the information.
1993	Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion.
1993	Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to complain, I wasn't clear on that action.
1993	Likely makes sense for Eric to coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.
1993	Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR costs.
1993	Let me know if this approach works.
1993	Best, Jeff
1994	Apologies.

1995	Jim: Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.
1995	With respect to the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only offers accepted.
1995	However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks would like that information.
1995	Just let me know.
1995	Prices are included for the offers that had prices attached when submitted.

1999	Best, Jeff
2000	FYI.
2000	Any thoughts Joe & Co.?
2000	Is release from contracts an "increase supply" option?
2000	My fear is that QFs get released and then California's "police state" mentality kicks in, enacting Exec Orders, legislation, etc. to ensure that the power from the QF facilities stays in California.
2000	Best, Jeff
2001	But for the very minor edits attached, the letter looks fine with me.

2003	"Likewise, the state is paying $25,000 through June to a Washington, D.C., firm headed by former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston. He served as chairman of the Senate's energy committee and will advise California on dealing with federal energy regulators. " Best, Jeff
2004	I'm here.
2004	If you'd like to de-brief on my marathon with Kasler, just give a holler.
2004	Best, Jeff
2005	Seems to me that that's exactly what the letter is saying and represents the commitment that we've made to our customers since raising the issue of re-sourcing, i.e., they'll pay the cost embedded in the contract, period.
2005	No more and less.
2005	I've assumed that the exposure associated with the utility-sourced electricity is substantially lower than the exposure associated with the customers remaining DA customers.
2005	Can you verify Mike Smith?
2005	Thanks.
2005	Best, Jeff
2006	How quaint.
2007	Thanks very much.
2007	It needs to go to Bev.

2008	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."
2008	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation.
2008	"With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said.
2008	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment.
2008	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in March 2000.
2008	She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies.
2008	Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of Planning and Research.
2008	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators.
2008	Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said.
2008	"This hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of dollars during the next 20 years."
2008	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the spot market.
2008	Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the general fund to continue buying power.
2008	If the $500 million is granted, the state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion.
2008	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities.
2008	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue bonds to pay for long-term contracts.
2008	But the guidelines haven't yet been released.
2008	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes.
2008	But the commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced.
2008	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly forcing the utilities into bankruptcy.
2008	"We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said.
2008	"With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial situation."

2039	Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has learned.
2039	A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges that rates would remain unchanged.
2039	Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell the state their transmission systems and some land.
2039	The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers.
2039	The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from runaway wholesale electricity prices.
2039	The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped utilities.
2039	The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
2039	Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's dysfunctional electricity market.
2039	"Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment," said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that is advising Davis in the talks.
2039	"The past situation has not worked well," he added.
2039	"The utilities want some certainty about their future."
2039	TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion.
2039	Discussions with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks.
2039	An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale.
2039	"Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall," the official said.
2039	"One of the dominoes is the rate freeze."
2039	A PG&E spokesman declined to comment.
2039	In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the rate freeze for months.
2039	The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion in debt accrued as a result of the freeze.
2039	"They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in various forms," said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC.
2039	"Adding it to the present talks is consistent with past behavior."
2039	Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be making progress.
2039	Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, told clients on Monday that the discussions "may have lost some momentum in recent days."
2039	He did not give a reason.
2039	For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent.
2039	SECRET STICKING POINTS "We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, and we will work out an agreement," Davis said at an appearance in San Jose.
2039	"But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm not going to reveal."
2039	One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze.
2039	Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the additions was not realized by state officials until this week.
2039	One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the radar screen of state negotiators.
2039	But the upshot, once the words had been parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates.
2039	CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking the PUC "to support the creditworthiness" of the utility.
2039	"This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions," it says.
2039	Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from ratepayers.
2039	"There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends if it is adopted," the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to disagree with such assumptions.
2039	But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch.
2039	"This is a very complex transaction," he said.
2039	"God and the devil are in the details."

2041	PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening.
2041	A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates.
2041	Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who requested the order.
2041	Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities that buy their power return to solvency.
2041	Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or "QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates.
2041	"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said.
2041	"It's immoral and has to stop."
2041	Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's supply of electricity.
2041	But many are shutting down because utilities have not paid them since November.
2041	The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid.
2041	The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said.
2041	The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more than 600 alternative energy producers around the state.
2041	Davis said to favor one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings from other creditors.
2041	The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work.
2041	"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion.
2041	"The utilities owe it to the people of the state to pay them."
2041	Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative producers ahead of their other creditors.
2041	But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the governor's office about possible payment structures.
2041	Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash they must close their plants.
2041	"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers.
2041	CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with Edison which has paid them nothing since November.
2041	CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract.
2041	Edison owes the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day.
2041	"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager.
2041	Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar.
2041	"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.
2041	The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude.
2041	Those negotiations eventually failed to move forward.

2042	California governor blames utilities for blackouts By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Gov. Gray Davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators.
2042	Davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the alternative plants, which use renewable forms of energy like steam and natural gas to generate electricity.
2042	The state has been spending about $45 million a day since January to buy power for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them.
2042	"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators," the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday.
2042	"They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop."
2042	The state lost about 3,100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 3.1 million homes, on Tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they can't afford to keep operating because the utilities haven't paid their bills in weeks.
2042	Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the utilities to pre-pay future bills to the alternative plants.
2042	PG&E called Gray's statements "inappropriate and unjustified," adding that it was negotiating a payment plan with the suppliers.
2042	Edison said it is intent on paying creditors and working with the Public Utilities Commission to pay the plants for future power sales.
2042	Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.
2042	Keepers of the state's power grid were cautiously optimistic that California might get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts after two idle plants were returned to service.
2042	"Never say never - but it appears we are going to be in better shape tomorrow (Wednesday) and for the rest of the week," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid.
2042	About a half-million customers were hit by Tuesday's blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into darkness from San Diego to the Oregon border.
2042	On Tuesday, Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell called on PUC President Loretty Lunch to resign.
2042	Lynch was appointed by Davis.
2042	Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but a spokesman for the governor dismissed Campbell's complaints.
2042	Meanwhile, a leading lawmaker on energy issues said the PUC may soon have to raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities' bills.
2042	"My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able to plan for it," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley.
2042	"They don't have to like it, but I think they'll appreciate it."
2042	Davis has said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills without further rate increases.
2042	In the meantime, the ISO is counting on conservation to avoid more rolling blackouts.
2042	Dorinson estimated that conservation accounted for about 900 megawatts in savings during Tuesday's peak usage.
2042	"That probably was the difference today in helping us avoid any rolling blackouts late into the evening," Dorinson said.
2042	Tuesday's outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2 p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order.
2042	They were blamed for at least one serious traffic accident.
2042	The blackouts were caused by a combination of problems, including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the Pacific Northwest, numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of power from alternative generators.
2043	Mike: Here are my comments.
2043	Apologies for the fact that they are quick and dirty.
2043	All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think, statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California is not "material."
2043	Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California has been a "financial disaster," that "Enron has lost over $300 million," and that "Enron stands to lose millions more."
2043	The losses are described as "huge."
2043	Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the market, but I'm not aware of it.
2043	And if it hasn't, it could represent a significant conflict with previous statements.
2043	Seems prudent to run this by IR and perhaps others before releasing.
2043	Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.
2043	It would seem prudent to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to making public.
2043	Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed "unanimously."
2043	I think that there was 1 nay vote.
2043	The statement is made that "the utilities were required to sell off most of their generating capacity."
2043	The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).
2043	They chose voluntarily to sell of the remainder of their fossil-fired plants.
2043	It is stated that stranded costs are "investments in imprudent power generation facilities."
2043	These investments were in fact found in the past to be prudent by the PUC.
2043	Would therefore not seem accurate to call them imprudent now.
2043	Is it now "virtually impossible to manage commodity risk" in California?
2043	Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation somewhat.
2043	From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing UC/CSU in the following manner, "It was actually a relatively easy decision to make."
2043	Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.
2043	Best, Jeff
2044	I have but one life to give for my industry....
2044	Please see my comments on Dennis' declaration---got some serious concerns.
2044	Can you give me a ring when you get a minute 415.782.7822?
2044	Thanks.
2044	Jeff
2045	I'm available.
2045	I have another call at 10 AM PST.
2045	Jeff
2046	when are comments due?
2047	I think that it's a good idea.
2047	The only red flag is the perception of marketers being in the same room together.
2047	However, from my perspective, though it's a significant concern, it's one that can be addressed.
2047	I would suggest running the notion by Sanders and Yoder to get their take.
2047	Best, Jeff
2048	chapter five but i can't remember the name of the case "home manufacturers"?, or some such thing.
2048	Have you checked the web site for the questions?
2049	Hi Professor: Could you let me know if you receive this?
2049	I've been sending you emails lately and, having gotten no response, am concerned about whether there's some sort of problem on my end, your end, or both.
2049	Thanks very much.
2049	Best, Jeff
2050	Class on Thursday.
2050	Something that we can talk about in Mexico?
2051	I'm here.
2052	Yes, we'll be talking about ROI, too.
2052	I'll let Karen know.
2052	Figure that she'll likely bring a couple of people.
2052	Mind if I ask Trish and John?
2053	I agree with Pat's suggestions.
2053	Thanks very much for the great work, Jeanne, particularly given the short notice.
2053	Best, Jeff
2054	yes, that's the assignment.
2054	i don't have the questions with me to fax (or the case).
2054	questions might be on the website?
2055	FYI.
2055	Just got a call from someone inside McKenzie & Co..
2055	Seems the good Governor has figured out that the gas industry is a problem and want to talk to me about it.
2055	I'm scheduled to talk to them by phone Friday at 1:30.
2055	I called Kari Dohn to try to find out more.
2055	She told me that they've figured out that the gas industry is a mess, that "McKenzie gets it," and she asked to tell it like it is.
2055	Seems useful to get our view across to them.
2055	The name of the person from McKenzie that will be on the call with the Davis folks on Friday is Daniel Poller.
2055	Thoughts?
2055	Best, Jeff
2056	FYI.
2056	We've been given permission to distribute, but no "on behalf of" the Air Force.
2056	Best, Jeff
2057	See highlighted portion.
2057	We should throw this back at Davis next time he points the finger.
2058	They must have realized that Loretta could use some PR help...
2059	Hi Laura: Is it possible to get a copy of the report?
2059	Thanks.
2059	Best, Jeff
2060	No. Yes for PG&E, no for SoCalGas.
2061	Agreed.
2061	I think that we can expect a strategy focused on saying, "we don't owe you anything, you've illegally hiked prices."
2062	eeks.
2062	i'm sorry.
2062	what does this mean?
2062	i don't quite understand the code.
2063	Greetings: Unfortunately, I'll be in Mexico getting the Mexican version of hoof and mouth.
2063	Bummer.
2063	Of course, the highlight of the semester for me was seeing Ms Deepika at Squaw last weekend.
2063	We should commit to a ski trip next year.
2063	Best, Jeff
2064	Will do.
2064	Do you know yet who will be on the call from your end?
2064	Thanks.
2064	Best, Jeff
2065	Hey, Neville.
2065	FYI.
2065	Best, Mike Kahn's best buddy
2066	Environmental issues and the permitting will be the biggest (and could be very big) obstacles---particularly given the Santa Barbara location (e.g., Channel Islands, etc.).
2066	Might be a good idea to have GA look into that side of things.
2066	If we feel that can be overcome, then the next big deal will be getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas.
2066	Finally, the issue you raised Steve---will Davis want to be the counterparty?---will loom somewhat large.
2066	Overall sounds like an exciting idea/opportunity.
2066	Best, Jeff
2067	That answers it.
2067	Thanks very much.
2067	Best, Jeff
2068	Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell Electricity Elsewhere Business Wire (Copyright , 2001, Business Wire) today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.
2068	Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the Salton Sea.
2068	The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is unable to pay for power demand.
2068	David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, "We applaud this short-term solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean, renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation."
2068	Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced since Nov 1.
2068	The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said.
2068	"That debt will continue to place a great strain on our operation."
2068	He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.
2068	On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E.
2068	That lower price had been incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the California Public Utility Commission's proposed order.
2068	California taxpayers will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.
2068	"It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our electricity," Sokol said.
2068	"That is the result of inaction by the state and bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what we are allowed under federal law."
2068	Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.
2068	But, Sokol cautioned, "While we are hopeful that this legislative and regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills from qualifying facilities."
2068	He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.
2068	CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.
2068	Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes.
2068	Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground.
2068	Magma rising in fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit.
2068	The generating plants convert the water to "live" steam, the pressure of which turns turbines to produce electricity.
2068	The plants then return the slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a renewable resource.
2068	CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore options to collect back payments from Edison.
2068	Together, the group is owed more than $300 million by Edison.
2068	Note to Editors: David Sokol will discuss today's ruling in a media teleconference at 2:30 p.m.
2068	PST today, March 22.
2068	Call 800/810-0924 and enter code 509085.
2068	Identify the CalEnergy conference.
2069	Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.
2069	It's a technicality.
2069	That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another provider, the rules would require Enron to "de-DASR," after which the new provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.
2069	The utility stands in the middle of all this.
2069	I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU is claiming the problem is.
2069	Might be viewed as a bit "cute" by the judge.
2069	Also, the legislation "fixing" the prohibition passed our of policy committee today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.
2069	Best, Jeff
2070	This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; they can and will only make matters worse.
2070	Caps are a policy chainsaw when a scalpel is needed.
2070	The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be doing.
2070	FYI: I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.
2070	Sokol blasted Edison over and over (e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).
2070	Sokol said that, at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically to force an involuntary.
2070	Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar tack.
2070	Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out of state).
2070	He said he expects to get a "market price" from El Paso and that if the "prices are higher out of state, well......."

2077	Lamentably, I'm out of the country next week.
2077	Given the B.S.
2077	that continuein Sacramento, I suspect that these legislators are likely to be extremelycranky at this event (assuming they're not forced to cancel due to the continued inability to find an answer).
2077	Under the circumstances, I wouldsuggest that it's likely not the best forum for us.
2077	Might be best to let the legislators slow roast a bit.

2079	Hey, is there a call-in # for the press call?
2080	The call in number is 1-800-374-2393 ...
2080	pass code: Independent Energy Producers
2081	I spoke yesterday with President Lynch's gas advisor and the PUC staffer who first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding whether we were returning customers to the LDCs.
2081	I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up (on our part) that has since been cleared up.
2081	Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to President Lynch's letter.
2081	(I said that our preference was not to respond formally, but would be happy to do so.) I asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries from our customers.
2081	Thanks to all for the help in responding.
2081	Please keep me in the loop on our marketing activities, etc. If I hear anything about customers calling the PUC, I'll let you know, and I'll let you know what I hear back from Lynch's office regarding whether we need to respond formally.
2081	Best, Jeff
2082	John: Please keep this confidential, but as you can see, this is not at all what I'm looking for.
2082	I need what we discussed yesterday.
2082	Thanks, Jeff
2083	dear arse: i can move it to the guest room closet for the weekend and plan to take it to mendocino soon as we return from mexico.

2086	What time will the daily team leads call be and when's it gonna start?
2087	Sorry, been away.
2087	For what it's worth.
2087	The footnote looks great.

2087	Best, Jeff
2088	Gas hearings ever resume?
2089	Michele: I apologize.
2089	I was unavoidably detained, and missed the call.
2089	I've just returned to my office.
2089	I would be happy to reschedule at your team's convenience.
2089	Please forward my apologies to your colleagues and tell them I'm very sorry an any inconvenience that I caused.
2089	Best, Jeff
2090	I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss.
2090	Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today.
2090	The legislature is, however, holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e., focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging").
2090	They held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities underway in the Legislature.
2090	I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship.
2090	One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and December.
2090	I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting the PUC to appear that it's doing something.
2090	I'll report more on the Legislative hearings as they occur.
2090	Best, Jeff
2091	Thanks.
2091	You do the same.
2091	Best, Jeff
2092	No, I think Paul intends to have the call.

2092	Paul wanted Hedy, Scott, Bev, Sandi, Paul and Sue to be on the call?
2092	I won't be on the call.

2093	Trying to figure out how to plant 10 acres of grapes on my land in Mendocino (rather have 10 acres of grapes than a place in S.F., I've decided---what do you think?).
2093	I was thinking of taking a pass on "sunner" school and just going all 6 semesters.
2093	Am I stupid?

2110	HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein BODY: ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis fails to clean up the power mess.
2110	??"All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down," said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda.
2110	"If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic."
2110	??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters understand Davis didn't create the problem.
2110	??"It won't be solved in six months," South said.
2110	"This is an immediate problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year process to get this situation back under control."
2110	??As for the governor's critics, "I think they should be asked to produce their own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read about in the newspapers have no plan."
2110	??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage.
2110	??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete.
2110	Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the state's congressional delegation.
2110	??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state.
2110	This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised to make the hallmark of his first term.
2110	??But electricity now overshadows everything else.
2110	To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates.
2110	And he is not shying away from the spotlight.
2110	??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park.
2110	That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, "We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We don't need to go to Disneyland for that."
2110	??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled the events of the past week.
2110	"In many ways, he appears to have gone politically tone deaf," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University.
2110	"His instincts are not serving him well."
2110	??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them that a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign.
2110	??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature.
2110	??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue.
2110	"I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks," said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch.
2110	"There's a high level of frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is."
2110	??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control.
2110	"No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do."
2110	??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and Democrats remain in a strong position.
2110	After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices.
2110	??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis.
2110	"People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives," he said.
2110	??"My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis)."
2110	??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.
2110	??"The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are," he said.
2110	"That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this summer."
2111	You're sweet.
2111	I'm responding from under a palapas.
2111	(From yesterday's 1:30 call, I see much ain't changed since I left. :) Best, Jeff
2112	Thank you.
2112	Sounds like it was a good meeting and Lay did a great job.
2112	Best, Jeff
2113	thanks.
2113	i'll review.
2113	Best, Jeff
2114	Hi Margaret: I'll get you my comments first thing Monday morning.
2114	Best, Jeff
2115	Hi Avrim: So sorry this took me so long, and I hope you haven't already left---I recayou saying that you guys were leaving on the 1st, which I hope is the case.Anyway, hope that this finds you before you depart.
2115	First, if you didn't buy a "Plan du Paris" ("map of Paris, in English) onyour first trip, I highly recommend it. All Parisians use it, it costs abou$10-15 and you'll use if for all your other trips to Paris. It's a must fogetting around the town. Every street in the city; all the "arrondissements": map of the subway system, etc. OK, here goes. It's been a while, and I don't have my "Plan" with me here in Mexico, so I'm working from memory. Hope that it's helpful. Once you'vebought your "Plan," you can reference my suggestions and get yourself oriented, link the walks together, etc. For an exotic (and cool) experience, go to "the Mosque" ("La Mosquee") inFrench. It's in the southeastern part of the city (15th arrondissement, or5th?). Go the cafe in the mosque and have tea. It's just very cool. La Rue Moufftard (sp?). It starts on the top of the hill where the Pantheois (across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens). It's a neat little street that winds down the other side of the hill. Go before noon when themarket fills the street---you can buy a few things and picnic in the Luxembourg Garden. Speaking of the Luxembourg Gardens, it's a neat place. I'd take a walk through---check out all of the "espaille'd" fruit trees----truly a work ofart. Walk to the other side of the Garden (opposite from the Pantheon side) andfind the "St.
2115	Sulpice" church. Very cool neighborhood (St. Germain des Preneighborhood). The church is on a square; there's a lot of very nice cafesand restaurants, and it's the site of the famous "Left Bank" fashion centerWhile you're over there, wander to the Montparnasse neighborhood and stop iat the "Rosebud" bar. Hemmingway and the gang drank there. It's small, thwaiters where little white coats and they play real vinyl records of the best jazz anywhere. Best of all, it's not pretentious. It's hip. Also there is a cemetery where many famous folks are buried (including SergGainsbourg)----cemeteries are of course a big deal in Paris, the most notabbeing the Pere LaChaise Cemetery, where Jim Morrison is buried. They're Interesting enough, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way.... In the Latin Quarter (5th arrond), check out "L'Ecluse," right on the riverat the Quai les Grands Augustins, just off Boulevard St. Michel. Little wibar with tasty things to nibble on. Great place to take a breather in thelate afternoon (somewhat) in style. The Picasso museum in the &Marais8 neighborhood is an absolute must. And while you,re there be sure to cruise the neighborhood. Very gentrified these days (and it,s the gay neighborhood), but been renovated into a lot of vimpressive art galleries and fashion houses---very neat. While there (in the same neighborhood) go to the &Place des Vosges.8 Unreal big old square from way back when---great to look at and there,s shops acafes. Architechturally magnificent and the exhibits inside are modest and very impressive. Rue de la Roquette is now extremely hip---on the east side of the Bastillebehind the &new opera8 (if you get a chance go an opera there---very populist experience and fun. Roquette is where the clubs and the musique are. General hip-dome (and if you,re inclined to do some real people-watching, go to Boulevard St. Germain and sit outside at Les Deux Magots or Caf, Fleureand watch away). Find on your map the church St. Eustache. Walk around east of it for somevery cool neighborhood viewing*used to be big wholesale butchers and suc(extension of Les Halles, which is now a big shopping mall but used to beParis, outdoor market). From there walk to &Place des Victoires, or Place des Notre Dame des Victoires (I can,t remember). And look for GallerieVivienne, too---Belle Epoque little food a shopping corrider*very neat. And finally, while your over there, go to the Palais Royale (by the Louvre)which is where Louis XIV grew up as a boy---fantastic courtyard, controversial artwork (black and white striped columns); walk to the opposite end, exit the courtyard out the back and continue walking in theneighborhood. I,ll leave the museums, etc. to you. Sorry to quick and dirty. Have a great time. See you soon. Best, Jeff
2116	Avram: Ignore the babble about the "Plan du Paris," since you already have it.
2116	Have a fantastic and safe time.
2116	See you in a couple of weeks.
2116	Best to you both in your travels.
2116	Jeff
2117	In all week.
2118	Hi Joseph: Could you please look in that little "legislator info" booklet and email to Janel address, phone #, fax and email (or fax) info for: Robert Hertzberg John Burton Debra Bowen Fred Keeley Janel: let us know if there are others for whom you need the info.
2118	As always, thanks a bunch Joseph.

2121	Best, Jeff
2122	Laura: Good talking to you.
2122	Per our conversation, here's the package.
2122	Thanks very much for passing it along.
2122	If you have any questions, etc., don't hesitate.
2122	Best, Jeff
2123	Hi Jason: Per my voice mail, here's the package of materials for customers to use to make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in California is critical.
2123	As I mentioned in the voice mail, the Legislature's likely to move this week on a variety of fronts, so it's important that the business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly.
2123	If you could forward this along to the SVMG members, it would be very helpful to the fight for cusomer choice and greatly appreciated.
2123	Information on how to contact the key legislators is included.
2123	Also included are "form" letters that folks can print out, sign, and send.
2123	If you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call at 415.782.7822.
2123	Best, Jeff
2124	FYI.
2124	She's forwarding around the Valley, and I'll follow up to make sure that she's having Chambers sign and send.
2124	Best, Jeff
2125	My understanding is that it's languishing but still has a decent chance of getting through.
2125	The question is when.
2125	I'll try to get some more firm information and get back to you later in the afternoon.
2125	Best, Jeff
2126	Any news from the litigation front with UC/CSU?
2127	This should help Prentice's chances for employment come the Fall.
2127	You guys should have a HUGE phone bill on your room charges.
2127	Please fax me a copy of the bill.
2127	I will cover all phone charges.
2127	Also, please forward to me what I owe you for the plane flight and golf and our share of dinners, drinks, guacamole, etc. We played spades at the airport.
2127	My team lost..........again.
2127	My losing streak now ties DiMaggio's hitting streak.
2127	Best, Jeff
2128	oh shit.
2128	you're right.
2129	Yes.
2129	And I'd be happy to call him and harass him.
2129	Better yet, if Ken Lay's willing to call him and harass him, that'd be better still.
2129	Best, Jeff
2130	Thanks a million.
2130	Do you think that you're boss is inclinded to put a call in to the governor regarding the importance of choice and/or sign and send letters to the leadership?
2130	Also, what was the name of the association you forwarded the package to?
2130	Thanks again.
2130	Best, Jeff
2131	My understanding (as of yesterday evening) is that it's on its own.
2131	I'll check and get back to you.
2131	Best, Jeff
2132	I apologize----worked on it Sunday evening thinking that I could finish up yesterday in the office (fat chance).
2132	Here's what I've done thus far, and I'll continue to edit today, if that would be helpful.
2132	Best, Jeff
2133	Thanks a million (as always).
2133	Give my best to Ray and tell him to hurry up and get this messed resolved.
2133	Best, Jeff
2134	I'll call.
2135	You're on.
2136	Laura: Sorry to bother you again, but I'm concerned that Justin is wildly busy and may not have the time to forward the package on to the SVMG.
2136	I'm hoping that you might have the distribution list and might be able to forward to that list, too.
2136	No big deal, just trying do everything we can to try to mobilize the troops on customer choice.
2136	Best, Jeff
2137	Sorry, don't know these folks.
2137	Best, Jeff
2138	I just got this note morning.
2138	Something must be wrong with my or your email (likely mine).
2138	Sorry about that.
2138	Best, Jeff
2139	On interminable conference calls---on another right now.
2139	Flight leaves at 3:30 PM, which I think gets me there around 5 or 5:15 PM.
2139	Why don't you just pick a restaurant and I'll meet you there.
2139	I'm staying at 5th Avenue Suites.
2139	If you want to eat at the resaurant at the hotel, that works for me.
2139	I'll call you when (and if) I get off this call.
2139	Best, Jeff
2140	I'll keep plugging, with plan being to get you the rest today.
2140	Best, Jeff
2141	Thanks.
2141	Best of luck in the prep.
2141	If I can be of any help, you folks know how to find me.
2142	I'll see you at 5:15 outside at the ticket counter level.
2142	I'm taking Alaska.
2143	Thank you.
2143	I'm still working on the first wave of magnums, though.

2145	Jim: Could you send me your version of the California presentation that I drafted for you and Rick?
2145	Thanks a bunch.
2145	Best, Jeff
2146	The entire phone bill is 300 pesos???
2146	Yes, please fax to me.

2148	we got back ok.
2148	(i didn't know tulsa had such a neat airport.)
2149	That's so weird.
2149	Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).
2149	I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.
2149	I thought they'd charge by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 calls), no matter how long one's one.
2150	no idea.
2150	sorry.
2151	I would suggest that we bring Bob in once we've had a chance to discuss internally today.

2154	Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms (Published April 4, 2001) There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that envelops California's energy crisis.
2154	Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control and the die is more or less cast.
2154	Whatever fate decrees - massive summer blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals for blame.
2154	No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with energy and moved to other matters.
2154	Legislative committees are working on the hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis have gone into semihibernation.
2154	Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will backfire.
2154	"Just remember Jimmy Carter," state Controller Kathleen Connell warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have "no excuses" for perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly.
2154	"We will be accountable on Election Day 2002," she said.
2154	Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined sharply in recent weeks.
2154	He devoted much of the weekend to defending his actions, saying, "I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this problem," and trying to pin blame on Republicans.
2154	Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses in the last three elections.
2154	The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis Davis.
2154	The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every sign of worsening.
2154	Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled "Meeting the Energy Challenge" to defend the governor's actions, it's apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit.
2154	The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves.
2154	The long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float.
2154	Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit.
2154	Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission grid have stalled, perhaps permanently.
2154	The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air conditioners or medical equipment shut down.
2154	And the utilities are closer to bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis.
2154	Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy.
2154	With Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

2156	could you please forward me the gas daily story re: investigation into EOL.
2156	I'm having a hard time locating.
2156	Thanks, Jeff
2157	Harry: Could you forward along to the EES folks we talked to yesterday who're interested in ISO's demand-side proposal.
2157	Thanks.
2157	Best, Jeff Market Participants, Attached is the California ISO's revised third RFB for Loads with emergency back-up generators that wish to participate in the ISO Demand Relief Program (DRP).
2157	The ISO would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised RFB.
2157	As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB.
2157	Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load portion.
2157	Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized.
2157	Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB.
2157	This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the next 24 hours.

2158	Hi.
2158	I'm traveling today, but wanted to let you know that those are the balance of my comments.
2158	Best, Jeff
2159	Yo, people.
2159	I love sports.
2159	Love baseball.
2159	Love you.
2159	But I ain't necessarily THAT keen on tying up my Sunday evenings, since, with no school this summer, I plan on spending just about every Sunday night driving back late from Mendocino, where I'll be working on putting vines in, sporting around in that new Zodiac, and shit like that.
2159	And when I ain't there, I hope to be backpacking, endurance riding etc. But y'all should go ahead without me.
2159	Lovingly, One half of The Sidekicks
2160	that is so cool that she's pregnant.
2161	please read your email.
2161	sent it about 3 hours ago?
2162	You might be right.
2162	Apologies if that's what happened.
2163	where are the charges?
2163	and please divide it all equally.
2163	it was a great time and there's just no reason for you guys to absorb the other costs, particularly when the rest of us have the means to help out.
2163	thanks again for a great time (despite the spades!).
2164	I need to check more, but here's my take.
2164	Politically---very popular with legislators; very easy to pass, etc. However, it would be so complicated to implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws, that I think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off.
2164	In addition, the utilities (whose retained generation collected a big portion of the "windfall" selling through the PX) would be subject to a big tax hit.
2164	Would that push them into bankruptcy?
2164	In short, easy to pass politically, pretty difficult to make stick legally.
2164	This help?
2164	You still have your PCG position?
2164	Best, Jeff
2165	I can't do Burton's district.

2166	Thanks.

2169	Best, Jeff Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product 2001-04-04 17:19 (New York) By Christina Cheddar NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise, knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more important.
2169	For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping track of credit risk has always been part of doing business.
2169	That became even more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based commodities trading network.
2169	In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders manage the credit risk.
2169	Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited basis.
2169	Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope.
2169	Last month, the company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
2169	Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known as the "Enron cost of credit."
2169	The rating is expressed as an interest rate.
2169	The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy and other related information.
2169	While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has turned the product into a new revenue stream.
2169	Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for a fee.
2169	The site also can sell a user a "digital bankruptcy swap," which is a way to hedge against credit exposure.
2169	The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against.
2169	For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
2169	According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.
2169	The tool is important because "in just a short amount of time, a company's credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight."
2169	At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into their earnings models.
2169	However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could increase.

2176	Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk: I'm in charge.
2176	Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis (likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to continue that charade).
2176	It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get through it.
2176	Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be likely.
2176	Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
2176	Windfall profits is a good idea.

2181	UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an end no later than the first quarter of 2002.
2181	"The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 2002," said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and Anderson School professor.
2181	However, getting from here to there will involve some painful adjustments, he warns, and "monetary medicine" from the Fed won't stop the pain this time.
2181	According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since December 2000.
2181	Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast made that quarter.
2181	"The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losing first-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to pure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. invested heavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel," said Dr. Leamer.
2181	"Things are different now."
2181	The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology and software has different implications for the principal regions of California.
2181	A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while Southern California will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright recession.
2181	Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a "high-tech" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impact on the San Francisco Bay Area.
2181	"We will most likely see not only a slowing of demand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, but also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries," said Dr. Lieser.
2181	The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002, with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates.
2181	A substantial slowdown in the California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth -- is also quite likely.
2181	"The strong increase in residential building permits seen during the November-January period will likely be short-lived," said Dr. Lieser.
2181	"We expect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. Southern California will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price increases."
2181	Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem for other states than for California, because of the state's lower per capita consumption.
2181	On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 in electricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999.
2181	Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranks only 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption.
2181	And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect California incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricity crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run.
2181	The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed and often-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and Southern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hall at The Anderson School at UCLA.
2181	In addition to providing the outlook for the state and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact of California's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the nation's most prominent authorities.
2181	Speakers included Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein, senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economic and business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting, executive vice president, Union Bank of California.
2182	FYI: The State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced that the melded interest rate on the bonds that he intends to issue (mix of taxable and tax-exempt) will be 5.38%.

2183	Thanks very much, Scott.

2184	Great job.

2184	Jeff
2185	Not that I've heard.
2185	I think that we'll have to wait for the public notice (which will provide the details) to determine that piece.
2186	Poll thus far: Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.
2186	He made the decision after talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say "poor quality receivables"?).
2186	Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase.
2186	Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't know what the position of his members is.
2186	Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports direct access.
2186	Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going to say.
2186	Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.
2186	Thoughts?
2186	I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.
2186	Best, Jeff

2189	Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power to the state, a U.S. court rules.
2189	By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton BEE STAFF WRITERS (Published April 6, 2001) In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state without guarantee of payment.
2189	State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off-line for maintenance.
2189	On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.
2189	Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat."
2189	But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal.
2189	While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market.
2189	The panel directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in July.
2189	The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which maintains and controls power transmissions.
2189	It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.
2189	"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change anything over the weekend," said Detmers.
2189	"But if Reliant decided on a unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely could have a system emergency."
2189	Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but declined to specify their next move.
2189	"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate."
2189	Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District Court decision.
2189	In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and production of electricity.
2189	The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
2189	He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, and that goes directly to an appellate court.
2189	The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly in debt.
2189	Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to the utilities.
2189	The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to sell to companies that are not creditworthy.
2189	But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.
2189	"My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson.
2189	He added, however, that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to emergency demands for power.
2189	Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.
2189	In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.
2189	"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he said.
2189	"But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at risk."
2189	Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend the suit.
2189	The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has jurisdiction.
2189	Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.
2189	In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big utilities and sell its power on the open market.
2189	Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell its power to PG&E.
2189	The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.
2190	Thanks.

2191	Reuters -& CNBC *PG&E SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY RELIEF NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
2191	Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the filing.
2191	They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents.
2191	The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
2191	The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court."
2191	A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail prices.
2191	Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

2197	Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.
2197	Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
2197	HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously described as an internal redeployment of staff.
2197	Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal computers.
2197	"The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are required for technical positions," she said.
2197	The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than expected, she said.
2197	However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue entertainment-on-demand services actively.
2197	Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron units, although there could be some involuntary terminations.
2197	Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment there.
2197	The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and telecommunications stocks in particular.
2197	On Friday it was up 95 cents at Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and electricity trading operation.
2197	Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index.
2197	Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, exceeding the total for all of 2000.
2197	Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to fill some other positions.
2198	This thing's been floating around the web for a while.
2198	Show's what's wrong with good ol' California.
2198	To wit: We want federal water subsidies so we can kill the fish and grow rice and grapefruit in the desert ("and we'll keep it all for us?").
2198	Let's drive our freakin' gas-guzzlin' SUVs all over, but hey, who needs to invest in roads; and somebody else come quick and clean up our air from all those emissions.
2198	And we're 49th in the nation for spending on education.
2198	Great stuff.
2198	Now, we've decided we want other state's with less sophisticated people (in places like Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) to build power plants (and pollution) in their states to feed electricity, and dam their rivers and kill their salmon so that we can heat our hot tubs and STILL pay 3 cents a kilowatt hour.
2198	And oh, by the way, it's federal taxes and the military industrial complex which has funded CA's weapons industry and communications industry.
2198	As no big fan of the military industrial comples, I'm just crying crocodile tears.
2198	Generally the kind of self-righteous doo-doo that turns people off to what is an otherwise great place to be.
2198	Yours in tender diatribes, Jeff PS Scott, I think that you're absolutely right: drilling in the Arctic Refuge in good for America....

2204	Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved.
2204	"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the "precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision.
2204	Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC "should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."
2204	Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the "extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it.
2204	Critics claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.
2204	"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said.
2204	If anything, she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is.
2204	There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted.
2204	"It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm."
2204	The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers.
2204	They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers.
2204	"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said [CP01-106.
2204	For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge."
2204	Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project.
2204	At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted.
2204	"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said.
2204	"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction."
2204	The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West.
2204	An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station.
2204	The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year.
2204	Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects.
2204	The 2003 project recently went through an open season
2205	Hmm.
2205	Interesting.
2205	Thanks for the info.

2221	"The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego" (April 2001) PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000.
2221	Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate freeze.
2221	We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels in San Diego.
2221	We find that average electricity consumption decreased by roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August.
2221	Demand was reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening.
2221	Because of the uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that could be achieved through pricing incentives.

2223	SB 43 has NOT been signed yet.
2224	John: I'm not sure how to read it, but it certainly doesn't seem encouraging.
2224	I'll try to find out more tomorrow.
2224	Best, The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern CaliforniaEdison Memorandum of Understanding: ?
2224	Commitment to Provide Power ) SCE will keep its current generation plaand other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulatedcost-of-service basis for 10 years.
2224	?
2224	Dedication of Power ) Edison International will commit the entire output of Sunrise (one of Edison International,s non-regulated generating facilities) to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years.
2224	Phase I of Sunrise is to be brought online by August 15, 2001.
2224	If not brought online by August 15, 2001Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.
2224	?
2224	Transmission Sale ) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),subject to certain adjustments.
2224	Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gainon sale, will be used to reduce SCE,s net undercollected amount as of Ja31, 2001.
2224	In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certain liabilities associated with the transmission assets.
2224	?
2224	Backup Transaction ) If the transmission sale does not occur within twyears for reasons beyond the parties, control, then if the State elects, SCE shall sell to the State SCE,s hydro generation assets.
2224	If the hydro assets are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.
2224	?
2224	Conservation Property ) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easements to the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectrrelated lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related lands.
2224	Some of the land may be deeded in fee.
2224	?
2224	Contribution by Edison International ) Edison International will refund to SCE not less than $400 million.
2224	This money will consist of a refund of approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
2224	?
2224	Investment ) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
2224	?
2224	Litigation ) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings afiled rate doctrine cases.
2224	?
2224	CPUC Regulation ) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historicalprinciples of ratemaking.
2224	?
2224	Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off ) SCE shall pay an amount that represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1,2001 that is attributable to QF,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE,s failure to pay the QF,s).
2224	SCE will securitize this amount.
2224	?
2224	Securitization ) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou(approx. $3.5 billion).
2224	The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).
2224	?
2224	The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollectedamount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in thenet undercollected amount.
2224	?
2224	The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does notoccur within two years.
2224	Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up in rates for two years, if at all.
2224	?
2224	Buying the Net Short ) The State will be required to buy the net shortthrough December 31, 2002.
2224	After 2002 SCE will be responsible for coveringthe net short.
2224	?
2224	Investment Recovery ) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of serviceratemaking period.
2224	?
2224	Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action): ?
2224	Definitive Agreements ) Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is tonegotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the transmission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other relatagreements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and thFacilities Services Agreement).
2224	?
2224	CPUC Action ) Prior to entering into the definitive agreements, the CPmust undertake certain actions (which include: establishing mechanisms forpreapproval of procurement costs and URG costs, deferring SCE,s general rate case until 2003, granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act).
2225	Works for me, but I have class on Thursday and will have to leave at 5 PM.
2225	That work?
2225	Best, Jeff
2226	Folks in Sacramento said that they haven't heard anything about it and aren't inclined to inquire.
2226	It's about 99% certain that we'll be "invited" to appear before the committee that's doing the wholesale price investigations, however, and very likely that we'll be served with a substantial number of questions in advance of that appearance.
2226	I'll stay on top of it and let you know just as soon as I do.
2226	If there's anything else, don't hesitate.
2226	Best, Jeff
2227	Greetings.
2227	I had a blast skiing--been way to long.
2227	I haven't called Ashish.
2227	I'll pick someone off of your list to call.
2227	Hope to see you soon.
2227	Best, Jeff
2228	Here's how I think this thing has played (is playing) out: PG&E was very tactical.
2228	They knew that the Edison deal was imminent.
2228	They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests.
2228	They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous once the Governor announced the Edison deal.
2228	Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy.
2228	(Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.) So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch.
2228	11, not the way of J. Bryson and Edison.
2228	This make sense?
2228	Best, Jeff
2229	FYI.
2229	PCG is up $1.6 as we speak.
2230	Hi.
2230	Any word on the mower?
2231	very sorry.
2231	hang in there.
2232	Here are the components as I see them: 1999 numbers for C&I are fine; I'd do 10%, 15%, 20% reductions.
2232	Assume C&I takes its proportionate share of the DWR's net short (i.e., if C&I is 2/3 of load, then 2/3 of CDW purchases should go to C&I) You can use the average price used in the DWR presentation to Legislators to the $ amount.
2232	The copy I've got sez that the average price for the first 5 years is $79/MWH.
2232	That seems like the # we ought to use.
2232	Now the hard part.
2232	The state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering.
2232	So how do we factor that in?
2232	Not sure that we can get detailed data (but check with Alan Comnes, who might be able to provide ISO real time prices (which is where the net short (of the net short) is being filled ISO---the ISO then sends that bill to PG&E. An easier way might be to use PG&E's numbers. In their bankruptcy announcement, PG&E sez that it's been costing them $300MM per month ($300MM * 0.67 * 0.10 =~$20MM). We could scale this number up to account for summer purchases. Alternatively, we could use ENA's forward curve. This is very quick and dirty (apologies) and I may have gotten something very wrong. If I've got any fatal flaws in the thinking (which happens often), please point them out. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate. Best, Jeff
2233	God help us.
2234	Works for me.
2235	That is so cool.
2235	Congratulations.
2235	That ain't an easy job (you know how traders are); but you'll do great.
2235	Where's Christi going?
2235	Best, Jeff
2236	OK, wondering why there ain't no charges on your credit card from our FABULOUS trip to Squaw Valley?
2236	I just found out that they're all on mine!!?!?!?
2236	I had the best time up there, but I couldn't figure out how it coulda cost $1700.
2236	Just called them to inquire.
2236	They said: There's no mistake those are all the carges for rooms 432 and 450.
2236	They're sending receipts.
2236	Unreal.
2236	Best, Jeff
2237	Worry not.
2237	Great deal.
2237	Best, Jeff
2238	Thanks.
2238	Any idea of what time it will air?
2239	Not a problem.
2239	Just couldn't believe that they screwed it up so much.
2239	There's 3 ft of new power at Squaw!!!!
2240	Hi: Could you send me a copy of the Trustee letter?
2240	Email would be great; otherwise, fax is 415.782.7854.
2240	Thanks.
2240	Best, Jeff
2241	where've we been?
2241	where've you been?
2241	really only stay at my house on school nites (monday/thursday).
2241	will be chez toi tonite.
2241	would LOVE to go back this weekend (it's gorgeous---TONS of iris, apple blossoms, wild flowers, etc.), but alas, we promised you're folks we'd plant tomatoes this weekend.
2241	I'm going to put down nice gravely rock around the beds, so it looks more like Italy, or France or something and we don't get all the weeds.
2241	Sorry about S.D., but it will be super nice down there.
2241	Be sure to go to Black's Beach.
2241	And golf and Torrey Pines.
2241	See you tonite?
2242	No problem.
2242	Worry not.
2243	lemme guess.
2243	you were a standup comic in another life?
2244	I was afraid you'd ask that.
2244	Don't know the exact number, but I'm assuming that it's a whole heckuvalot less than the May 1-December 31 exposure.
2244	Best, Jeff
2245	Thanks.
2245	FYI.
2245	The Negative PX Credit language in the MOU reads (on p.31): "the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; " Could go several different ways, but arguably could be read to say that SCE will make good on credits up to 12.31.2000.
2245	If that were the case, I'm assuming that about 75-90% of our exposure would be covered?
2245	Best, Jeff
2246	Ouch.
2247	So it could be one way or the other...
2248	Greetings: Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the following.
2248	Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.
2248	For California it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC Commissioner).
2248	Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who can explain what the heck California's doing).
2248	Hertzberg then asked that FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.
2248	Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.
2248	Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be under considerable pressure to give in to caps).
2248	The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 9 republicant governors opposing price caps.
2248	Sue will be distributing the letter.
2248	Best, Jeff
2249	Not a problem.
2249	There's 3 feet of power at Squaw.
2249	The interest on the charges was $500.
2250	Hi Hedy, Scott, Sandi: Any news on signing of SB 43?
2250	Eric Letke mentioned that Sony--a potential customer--told him that the Governor signed it on Friday and that they (Sony) had a representative at the signing.
2250	Any news would be great.
2250	Thanks a bunch.

2254	Pleasure's all mine.
2255	Comrades: Attached you will find the call assignments for the new admits.
2255	We all have five or six people to call in the next 7-10 days.
2255	I made a couple of matches where it seemed there was some kind of similarity in background or career, but for the most part, the assignments were essentially random.
2255	The list includes names, phones at home and work, company and title.
2255	Remember these are newly admitted students who have not yet accepted our offer of admission.
2255	The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th.
2255	A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be: 1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School 2) indentify yourself as "involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program. Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around. EMBA office will coordinate. 5)remind them of the "New Students Admit Reception" on April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent email for other particulars. Some pieces of information you might want to have handy -required new student orientation is August 11-12; classes start on the 13th -fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required, including the two units for MPAR -orientation packages will be sent out mid-June -administration will call each new student in July with class schedules -second round of admits come out in early June Thanks very much for helping.

2256	Ah Jeez: Hey Joseph, I was supposed to trade a name with Deepikah and, wouldn't you know, with all the fine print, I grabbed one of yours (bet you're sorry you asked me to help out now).
2256	Anywho, I called and left a message with Tim Taylor.
2256	You call him yet?
2256	If so, he'll think he's very special, what with all of us calling him.

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a ``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price controls on wholesale power.
2260	Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California, engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that are expected to go only higher this summer.
2260	``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC commissioners.
2260	California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999.
2260	But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt, said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed.
2260	FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power generation.
2260	Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to propose a price cap for deliberation.
2260	Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be tempered with common sense.'' ``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago.
2260	Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million in refunds on California power sales.
2260	He also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of tracking market abuses.
2260	The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided over whether the government should regulate electricity prices.
2260	Keeping tabs as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them, five against and three uncertain.
2260	Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in Olympia, Wash. ``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the problem.
2260	Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&E into bankruptcy.'' Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
2260	California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based price cap in the Western markets.
2260	``We have done our part.
2260	We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker of the California Assembly.
2260	He cited state actions to boost conservation, increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is ``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a year ago.
2260	Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing.
2260	``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting.
2260	Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls.
2260	She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price implementation plan.'' The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator.
2260	Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control.
2260	Neither nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate.
2260	While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little to address problems in the power markets.
2260	The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging unreasonable prices.
2260	FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and reasonable'' wholesale power prices.
2260	``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said.
2260	``Politically we're getting beat up.'' Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to deal with the troubled electricity market.
2260	Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power prices have yet to hit consumers.
2260	In many cases state officials must still give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers.

2261	Michael: Do we know who from Enron will actually be on the committee?
2261	Best, Jeff
2262	FYI.
2263	Thanks.
2263	Any view on the likelihood that the brief will have weight?
2263	Best, Jeff
2264	Disregard previous note.
2264	Saw your name on the official document.
2264	Best, Jeff
2265	Thanks.
2265	Would be useful to get a copy.
2265	Best, Jeff
2266	You betchya.
2267	Thanks very much Scott.
2267	Any view on when we can expect the clean-up bill will be signed?
2267	And is there anything of substance in the "clean-up" provisions that we ought to be aware of?
2267	Thanks again.
2267	Best, Jeff
2268	Hey, when will the announcement be made?
2269	Thanks again for the help.
2269	Much appreciated.
2270	FYI.
2271	Thanks very much.
2271	I'll give him a ring at home.
2271	Best, Jeff
2272	You're kidding.
2272	You mean they've double billed us?
2272	Can you find you're credit card bill?
2272	They can find each and every receipt, who signed it, etc., so that we can make sure they don't screw us.
2272	I'll bring my stuff over tonite.
2272	If they've double billed us, I'm going to suggest that they owe us a comp up there.
2272	No worries, though.
2272	They've got the paper work, and if we've paid twice, they're just going to need to credit my card.
2272	No big deal.
2272	Just a hassle having to deal with 'em.
2272	You around tonite?
2273	Dinner would be great.
2273	Best place to stay--given where you need to be---but sometimes a bit difficult to get in to, is the Park Hyatt.
2273	If full, try the Griffin (or Griffith) Hotel (or might be the Hotel Griffin(th)).
2273	Let me know if you have problems and I'll throw some more names your way.
2273	Best, Jeff
2274	Wow.
2274	Call my travel agent.
2274	Book me on a heavy guilt trip....
2275	did they charge your credit card, too?
2275	if they double-booked us, we better get a free weekend out of it (in addition to getting the money back).
2276	Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities.
2276	Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the California State University and University of California systems.
2276	Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices.
2276	Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab.
2276	"It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for," Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said.
2276	He later described the case as being "all about money. It's all about money."
2276	Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems.
2276	Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a "marketing game" with the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times more than what the electricity cost Enron.
2276	He said lawmakers may have "left the keys in the car" when they approved California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy crisis, "But it is still theft to steal the car."
2276	The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds.
2276	When the judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose the suit.
2276	"I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim," the judge said.
2276	UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is about $26 million.
2276	CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and $20 million for natural gas.
2276	The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.

2277	You got it.
2277	I'll put my thinking cap on and start pondering.
2277	Best, Jeff
2278	This seems principally to be a "help Davis now" sort of exercise, but perhaps there's a business opportunity in it for EES.
2278	Thoughts?
2279	If you need me to, I can do it.
2280	what day you planning on golfing?
2281	nope, but prentice has informed me that we need to be at david and nina's (i think around 4 pm) on sunday.
2281	so we could either play at 9 on sunday, or in the afternoon on saturday (say 2 pm?).
2281	your call.
2282	Wow.
2282	That's fascinating.
2282	Sounds neat.
2282	I would be very concerned, though, given the current environment about having us listed as a sponsor.
2282	In short, I would recommend against sponsoring, at least at this point.
2282	Best, Jeff
2283	Thanks very much.
2283	And, yes, I did get a haircut.
2283	She cut a TON off.
2284	doesn't look like it at this point.
2284	i need to talk to prentice some more.
2284	she talked to nina.
2285	I don't know about the roommate info, but I do know that they go back a very long way.
2285	Then Gov. Jerry Brown (now Mayor of Oakland) appointed Bryson to be the President of the California PUC.
2285	Way before out time---I think that it was in the early '80s.
2285	At the same time, Davis was Brown's chief of staff---so their relationship goes way back.
2285	Best, Jeff
2286	Is it possible to get the call-in number for the 2:30 call?
2286	Thanks very much.
2286	Best, Jeff
2287	Thanks.
2287	Which attorney is this info from?
2288	Greetings: I'll be bringing the beginnings of the valuation model and an idea (for folks to beat up on) for the approach in the presentation.
2288	Best, Jeff
2289	Agreed.
2289	That time works for me.
2289	Jeff
2290	It would be useful for me to have the opportunity to listen in on these calls.
2290	Let me know if that's a problem.
2290	Best, Jeff
2291	FYI: I listened in on the analyst call.
2291	Bryson made it very clear that, under the agreement, Edison would re-assume the procurement role on 12.31.02 and would "administer" (i.e., takeover) the DWR contracts.
2291	Seems pretty clear that the State is actively looking for a strategy to exit the procurement role.
2291	Best, Jeff
2292	You're point?
2293	Ralph: Apologies for taking so long.
2293	Here's the URL for the details of the MOU.
2293	Look forward to reviewing your proposal.
2293	Regards, Jeff
2294	Lemme know how it goes.
2295	Sorry, been on calls.
2295	Just got your message.
2295	From my perspective, you got it exactly right in the note.
2295	If you have any additional questions, just holler.
2295	Best, Jeff
2296	As I feared, Belden's on vacation this week.
2296	I've left a message with him to call, however.
2296	Will let you know just as soon as (and if) I hear anything.
2296	Best, Jeff
2297	Amen.
2298	Were you on the call yesterday---I went ballistic.
2298	And where are you now!?!
2298	The calls underway.
2299	Ralph: Thanks.
2299	Really looking forward to discussing further.
2299	The proposal is very promising.
2299	As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns: 1) ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the "terms specified by the Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers from financial harm" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of killing direct access (like AB 1890 did).
2299	Appreciate you sharing this.
2299	You can count on Enron's support.
2299	(Though I understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after commodity---I leave that up to your judgment. We'll be prepared to help in away way you see fit.) Have a nice weekend.

2300	FEA's asking for a uniform percentage increase on top of existing rate allocation structure.
2301	CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.
2301	CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.
2301	The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.
2301	Specifically: Service Eligibility: Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered Customer Eligibility: Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.
2301	(As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.) Customer Charge Surcharge: A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.
2301	In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.
2301	Optional Summer On-Peak Period: Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.
2301	Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability.
2301	The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.
2301	Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc. All bear upon such an effort.
2301	Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service: Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.
2301	The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality.
2301	In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.
2301	These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday.
2301	Notice and Service: An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.
2301	The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.
2301	Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.
2301	Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.
2301	Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.
2301	It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities.
2301	In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the following is observed.
2301	For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.
2301	Of the 163, all but 8 can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.
2301	The 8 would appear to require a field visit.
2301	For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or 3% of the total are SIC 20.
2301	Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly interval meters.
2301	The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming.
2301	Conclusion: Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a significant barrier to establishing the program.
2302	This is unreal.
2302	If TW ain't on the A list, who is?
2303	I'll look at it and get back to you first thing Monday.
2304	I'll be getting you stuff tonite or tomorrow.
2304	Best, Jeff
2305	Dudes: Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to Jimmie's model.
2305	I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some talking to do on the model.
2305	Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow (as opposed to NI).
2305	I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow model.
2305	All my stuff is highlighted in yellow.
2305	It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).
2305	I get at 25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions.
2305	I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.
2305	Others agree?
2305	Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some work.
2305	Take a look and let me know what you think.
2305	Best, Jeff
2306	Guess I was lazier still.
2306	Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.
2306	31% and 40% growth rates are (I would argue) wildly unrealistic.
2306	In addition, the capex numbers would (presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there.
2306	Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 price (though "irrational exuberance" may permit Netscape to pull it off).
2306	Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for the memo.
2306	Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.
2306	Great job on the case.
2306	Thanks.
2306	Best, Jeff
2307	no problem.
2307	give me a call and we can go through your list.
2307	Best, Jeff
2308	OK folks.
2308	It's about 80% of the way there.
2308	My brains are oozing out looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well.
2308	I'll continue to check it and de-bug it.
2308	Mark, you and I should talk, too.
2308	(You'll note that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.) Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).
2308	If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.
2308	I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together.
2308	And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend?
2308	In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including Dupont, for OAT.
2308	Does this work for folks?
2308	Other thoughts?
2308	Best, Jeff
2309	These slides look very good and good to go from my perspective.
2309	I have no comments.
2309	Best, Jeff
2310	Apologies.
2310	My dead just fell into a million pieces.
2310	I won't have a chance to review Jimmie's fine work (nice name for the CFO, by the way), and I've just been informed that I'll need to have dinner with our bankruptcy guy this evening (turns out we're on the unsecured creditor committee for PG&E's banckruptcy).
2310	So I won't be able to be in class tonite.
2310	Again apologies.
2310	Great job Jimmie, particularly in light of the Easter holiday.
2310	Best, Jeff
2311	We'll be at the party, Overture, or no Overture.
2311	The Squaw thing ain't a problem.
2311	No worries.
2311	But let's settle soon.
2311	My accounts are a little wacky these days---I'll explain later.
2311	Thanks for letting me know.
2311	With the playing, there's a lot of little issues that I think are no big deal, but from our weekend at Squaw, it seems that there are some major fucking huge issues that you and the mighty C needed to work out.
2311	If you've got those worked out, then I'm all fer playing again, though the next 2-3 weeks are pretty fucking ugly.
2311	Best, Jeff
2312	Prentice and I talked.
2312	She's going to come back from the sports gig for the dinner party.
2312	Don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---Prentice is cool.
2312	She's ready to play.
2312	She and I have been playing together (though our respective repertoires, as designed by Avram, diverge more than they converge).
2312	We're getting pretty hot on Earl's breakdown, though.
2312	P.S.
2312	Comes a point in one's life (like, when you're an adult), that you take personal responsibility for your actions---"my dad made me do it" must simply give way.
2312	And "my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist" must REALLY really give way.
2312	Best, Jeff
2313	-FYI.
2313	This is an internal email of the SVMG.
2313	Please keep confidential.
2313	I'll be monitoring.
2313	Thanks.
2313	Best, Jeff As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing, specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday.
2313	A copy of his proposal is attached.
2313	As I indicated at last week's meeting, I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain conditions, for the following reasons: - It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments (blackouts).
2313	- It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers.
2313	This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention.
2313	- It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods.
2313	The following is a "strawman" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday.
2313	I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible, an issue of concern to some.
2313	Also, I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting.
2313	Thanks.
2313	Peter Evans Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices).
2313	This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts.
2313	Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers.
2313	We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels) at the real-time energy price.
2313	Our support for this concept includes the following conditions: 1.
2313	Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's historical load profile.
2313	Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume.
2313	Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build in some expectation of conservation.
2313	2.
2313	Participation All customer classes would participate.
2313	In the absence of real time load data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price.
2313	3.
2313	Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to.
2313	This could include self-generation, bilateral forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR.
2313	4.
2313	Sunset This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring government or regulatory action to extend it.

2314	Our schedules make it messy.
2314	I can come over tomorrow during the break if Anil and Carolyn want to meet.
2314	Mark, if you want to hunker down with the model tomorrow, you should feel free.
2314	The only thing about Thursday is that Carolyn's got a commitment with Dian.
2314	Can we talk about meeting this weekend?
2314	I can be flexible.
2314	Best, Jeff
2315	Having worked with you on the Perfect project, I now know that your power point skills are legendary.
2315	Would you mind volunteering to coordinate putting all the stuff in to power point?
2316	How's Tues, may 1, or wed may 2, work for dinner?
2316	sorry it's two weeks out, but i'm in serious crunch time for school (and work).
2317	Oh, that's very funny.
2317	Just like the good old days?
2318	I can attend if feel it is necessary that we participate.
2318	Just let me know.
2318	Jeff
2319	Sunday works for me, and we can meet in my office.
2319	But if it's OK, 10 AM works better for me.
2319	Let me know.
2319	And Anil has very graciously offered to coordinate the power point presentation for the project.
2319	And having worked with Anil on another project that required power point, I can vouch that he is at wizard with the technology.
2319	Best, Jeff
2320	do you have access to the actual report issued by PIRA, to which the article refers?
2321	Hey, darlin'.
2321	What's our freshly-minted MBA up to these days?
2321	You gonna stay in good 'ol Texas?
2322	Thanks, Dennis.
2322	If we could get a copy of the analyst's report, it would be very helpful.
2322	Best, Jeff
2323	Here it is.
2323	Give me a call when you get a chance to look at it.
2323	Also, please tell Jeff A. that I'm still doing reconnaissance on smart types to join your group.
2323	Best, Jeff
2324	call with EES at 1 pm.

2324	jeff
2325	got message.
2325	hearing start yet?
2325	jeff
2326	That's the ticket on the recipe.
2326	I can give you some more ideas if you like.
2326	Please let Prentice and me know what we can do to pitch in. Best, Jeff
2327	hearing on yet?
2327	jeff
2328	Greetings Dorothy: Hope all is well.
2328	I can participate in your meeting tomorrow.
2328	Is it possible to participate by conference call, or would you prefer that folks attend in person?
2328	Just let me know.
2328	Best, Jeff
2329	FYI.
2329	The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt O'Loughlin.
2329	They will make up the first panel, titled, "California's High Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors."
2329	In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular-- to show that SoCalGas has considerable market power in California and abuses it.
2329	(Edison was a long-time, very unhappy gas customer of SoCalGas', until it sold off its power plants. The animosity remains, however.) Should be interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel.
2329	CA PUC lawyer, Harvey Morris, is the sole witness on the second panel.
2329	Harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate markets serving California and is the PUC's lead attorney on such matters at I plan on attending the hearing.
2329	It's likely that I will also be attending a hearing on price caps at CMA's offices in the afternoon.
2329	Best, Jeff
2330	Greetings: I tried to log in and the system told me that I'm not authorized to use the system.
2330	Best, Jeff
2331	I'll actually be in Sacramento tomorrow (need to hear the hub-bub at the gas version of the energy war crimes trials taking place up there tomorrow).
2331	Steinberg's hearing starts at 9, so I should be able to pop by at 1 if that works for you.
2331	Best, Jeff
2332	Agree.
2332	I think she's already gotten a helluvalot better--a marked and very positive change.
2332	Reflection and realization are powerful things.
2332	I'll bring all the paperwork over tonite.
2332	We can go over it then.
2332	It actually adds up, as far as I can tell.
2332	It was fun as hell, but it sure weren't cheap.
2332	Best, Jeff
2333	Thank you.
2333	I'll give it a go.
2334	congratulations on being "re-commissioned."
2335	FYI.
2336	It's nothing.
2336	I eat your food, drink your wine, eat your tomatoes, stay in your time share, date your daughter, use your pool table, stay at your dome, and get feted by you on my birthdays.
2336	Paying for Ms Beautiful's golf is a small token, indeed.
2336	Best, Jeff p.s.
2336	hope everything at work is going well--i'm sure that it is.
2336	p.p.s.
2336	we say barry's 500th last nite!!!!
2336	It was so cool.
2336	go giants.
2337	Here's the document that I referenced.
2337	Dan Allegretti asked me to forward it to you.
2337	He'd like to distribute to the leadership team and have it on the agenda during his part of the conference call.
2337	Thanks a million.
2337	Best, Jeff
2338	What day is here birthday?
2338	Is it the 5th of May?
2339	As always, thanks very much for your help.
2339	Best, Jeff
2340	Greetings: I intend to clear my calendar to help with this for the rest of the week.
2340	I'll call you/you call me first thing in the AM.
2340	Best, Jeff
2341	wouldn't miss it for the world.
2341	for the record, ms silva has stolen an idea that i originated years ago, i.e., favorite take out.
2341	Colleen, as you'll remember, there were nothing but cigarette butts in the food by the end of the party.
2341	Ah, the days of wine and song.
2341	nostalgically yours,
2342	3 of my 5 have said that they're accepting (indeed, may have already accepted).
2342	i'm awaiting 2 call-backs.
2342	will report more tomorrow in class.
2342	best, Jeff
2343	rite spot.
2343	17th and folsom.
2343	the best.
2343	Best, Jeff
2344	Shoot.
2344	Remember that I asked many moons ago if you wanted the tickets?
2344	I thought you said no.
2344	So I let it go.
2344	Now they've all been snatched up.
2344	But I'll see if if those folks are still planning on going.
2344	I think that chances are extremely slim, though.
2344	I'll let you know.
2344	Sorry.
2344	Best, Jeff
2345	If those times are CDT, 5 PM works best for me.
2345	Best, Jeff
2346	Jay: As we discussed, we are comfortable with EES' participation in the ISO's load curtailment RFP.
2346	If you have any other questions, just give me a call at Best, Jeff
2347	Dorothy: Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday.
2347	From my perspective it was veruseful.
2347	Per yesterday's conversation.
2347	More (much) to follow (soon).
2347	This is what we gave the Govenor, Hertzberg, Burton, Brulte, etc., about 2 months ago (i.e.prior to Davis' 20-20 announcement, etc.) You know how to get a hold of me.
2347	Best, Jeff Proposal to Alleviate California,s Electricity Shortage Through Incentives to Reduce Demand Objective =15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand Proposal =15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately conduct on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs =15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-downprogram.
2347	However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authorito execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and directhe CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediateThe Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program) =15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction =15 If the &supply8 of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds 2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission whythey chose not to accept them =15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continuepayment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone dto demand reductions A Single Price Approach =15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages: =15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PCoverpaid lower cost generators.
2347	The state would overpay for reduced demandunder the single price approach.
2347	=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaintregarding the cost of demand reductions.
2347	By conducting an auction the statwill be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting withthe lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to the cost the state is willing to pay.
2347	=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customers who would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.
2347	A well publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than last year would further reduce demand in the state.
2347	Thus the auction and the single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
2347	=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consumers, since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service interruptions caused by the demand reductions =15 If DWR implements the program, DWR, would recover its costs through rates, similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would incprogram costs in rates collected from customers =15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transparency and reduce the time required to complete the process Hazards to Avoid =15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementation of the reductions _ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail toachieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001 _ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility _ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and presentthe contract to the California PUC for prompt approval _ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders _ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of makingparticipation as easy and expansive as possible _ Pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transactiontime _ Once the PUC has approved the auction process, the PUC should not apply aadditional review to the auction results _ Auction &pre-approval8 will ensure that the utilities are actively and constructively engaged Actions =15 Governor,s office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential program =15 CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within 30 days _ Establish abbreviated schedule _ Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment _ Finalize decision approving auction proposal within 15 days of utility submission =15 CPUC rules in advance that results of auction are prudent, and utilities conduct auction by May 1
2348	Thanks very much, Doug.
2348	Good to see you yesterday.
2348	Best, Jeff
2349	FYI.
2349	Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.
2349	If you have any questions, call me at 415.782.7822.
2349	Please forward to others whom you think might be interested.
2349	Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?
2349	Best, Jeff
2350	Thanks, Steve.
2350	I'll coordinate with Rosie.
2350	Best, Jeff
2351	Apologies.
2351	I need to get off and do this new assignement that Kean just gave me.
2351	Jeff
2352	Bob: I'm not going to be able to make this time (particularly given the assignment that I just got from Kean).
2352	Can I catch up with you after?
2352	Best, Jeff
2353	You mean fighting the MOU?
2354	Jennifer.
2354	I apologize.
2354	I have to turn to assignment that Steve Kean just gave me.
2354	I made it almost all the way through the document.
2354	You did a fantastic job under the circumstances and given the time constraints.
2354	If I can get Steve's assignment finished quickly, I will turn my attention back to this.
2354	Hope it helps.
2354	Best, Jeff
2355	Crudely put (my apologies), I think it goes something like, "don't sacrifice the $200+ billion US electricity market for a $150 MM claim."
2355	(Akin to the "domino theory" applied to the electricity market.) That make any sense?
2355	Best, Jeff
2356	Hmmm.
2356	FYI.
2356	Dear old Edison.
2357	Shoot.
2357	I'm sorry.
2357	Is this what you called to discuss?
2357	I'm here.
2357	(with a "need yesterday" assignment from Steve).
2357	Give me a call at 415.782.7822.
2357	Best, Jeff
2358	Will do.
2359	what happened at the exec committee meeting?
2360	Make sense for me to attend the meeting?
2361	Greetings: Look forward to it.
2361	I've just had two "need them yesterday" requests that I need to complete today.
2361	Are you available tomorow to discuss further?
2361	Best, Jeff
2362	Folks: My apologies.
2362	This is not proofed, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had a chance to review and comment.
2362	Apologies for any unintentional omissions and errors.
2362	I think it tracks closely with the direction agreed to on the call today.
2362	All comments are encouraged and welcome.
2362	Best, Jeff
2363	Attached is the final.
2363	Thanks to all for help and comments.
2363	Best, Jeff
2364	See email.
2364	All comments compiled/integrated.
2364	Final just sent.
2364	Jeff
2365	Huh?
2366	Today's the 7th anniversary of the release of the California Commission's now infamous "Blue Book" that launched Direct Access.
2366	Would it be bad taste for Skilling to note the anniversary on the call with Bryson?
2366	Viva Choice....
2366	Best, Jeff
2367	Thanks, man.
2368	Karen: See highlited section of story below.
2368	PG&E's got it right.
2368	Recall that DWR was only buying power that it determined was "priced reasonably."
2368	Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.
2368	That meant that the ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.
2368	The ISO would then charge the utilities for the power purchased.
2368	Recall that Bob Glynn referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.
2368	Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.
2368	So it's therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by Governor Backbone.
2368	Best, Jeff

2372	jeff
2373	Greetings TJ: Well I'm in a pickle.
2373	The memo you sent said we had from 11:30 AM to 10:00PM on 4.19, and from 7 AM to 9 AM on 4.20.
2373	But the documentation I received from Telebears said from 1 PM on 4.19 to 1 PM on 4.20.
2373	All that aside, I have obviously missed the times, it's my fault, and I apologize.
2373	I spoke with Diane this morning and she suggested that I throw myself at the mercy of the court by writing you an email with my picks.
2373	Here they are: Class Control # My Priority Units Financial Institutions and Markets 09472 4 3 Leadership and Change 09520 5 3 I'd like to take 7 units (2, 3-unit classes and the 1-unit class).
2373	Sorry for the mix-up.
2373	Thanks very much for you help.
2373	If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.
2373	Best, Jeff
2374	I thought that the call was at 4 pm today?
2374	I'l llikely be in the office, but just to make sure, have them call me on my cell phone at 415.505.6633.
2374	Best, Jeff
2375	FYI.
2375	Looks like this is moving along.
2375	I'll get this folks what they need and let you know how it's going.
2375	Best, Jeff
2376	I'll read it then call you.
2377	Looks good, Scott.
2377	One thing: I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit (which, I believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based on market and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers.
2377	Mike Day: Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?
2377	Like your arguments, Scott.
2377	Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest.
2377	Best, Jeff
2378	You got it.
2378	Just give me a call and we'll walk through "the other side of the story."
2378	Best, Jeff
2379	The pleasure, Ms Denne, is all mine.
2379	Have a great weekend.
2379	Best, Jeff
2380	Happy to.
2380	It'll have to wait till Monday, though.
2380	That work?
2381	I nabbed the Co's 4 tickets (not great, but free) for the game against the Bums on Wed June 27th.
2381	Starts at 4 PM.
2381	Interested.
2381	The Tuesday game's at 7:30, but thought it'd be nice to see an early game.
2381	Let me know.
2381	Best, Jeff
2382	You mean I can register in Telebears this Monday from 7 AM to 8 AM?
2382	I have a 7 AM conference call on Monday, but I'll do my darnedest to register then.
2382	Thanks for being patient.
2382	Best, Jeff
2383	Harry: You clearly did a fantastic job, particularly under the circumstances described by Leslie.
2383	Thanks a million for your help--we really needed it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact, to boot.
2383	And thanks.
2383	too, to Leslie.
2383	The EES piece of the California puzzle is extremely challenging (as you know) and your and Harry's efforts are greatly appreciated.
2383	I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday.
2383	Thanks again.
2383	Best, Jeff
2384	Bradford's a former career--PUC Commissioner (I think he's now with Moskovitz' RAP group).
2384	Severin Borenstein's the UC Berkeley professor who's been vocal on wholesale market power and the need for real-time pricing to encourage conservation.
2384	Don't know the other consultant fellow.
2385	FYI: Here's monthly share price date over last five years for: OAT, KO, PEP, S&P, BRKA, BRKB.
2385	(I included Berkshire in the event we want to say something about Buffet's recent performance. I've attached another file with a chart that shows Buffet versus S&P for 1, 3 and 5 year performance) For the OAT, KO, PEP, etc. file, calculated year-on-year performance (excluding dividends).
2385	Also, you'll see highlighted in yellow month-on-month performance for 2001.
2385	But ain't done any chart for that stuff yet.
2385	Thought we'd discuss first.
2385	Best, Jeff
2386	Yes, we have been working with them.
2386	Stephanie and I were asked to meet last week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at length.
2386	It was a very positive meeting.
2386	Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.
2386	And I believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further in D.C. I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.
2386	I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to contact him.
2386	Best, Jeff
2387	Thanks.
2387	Could you please send around the model, too?
2387	I want to use for the financials table.
2387	Best, Jeff
2388	You'll be pleased to know that I registered over the web version of telebears this morning.
2388	If there's anything else, please don't hesitate.
2388	Best, Jeff
2389	Delainey/Whaley buy off on the approach?
2390	I mean on the approach for dealing with Edison re: alternative structures for payment.
2390	When's the drop dead for getting edits to Jennifer's "solution" piece.
2390	You looking at it?
2390	Best, Jeff
2391	Not a problem.
2391	My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and are comfortable with the back and forth banter.
2391	I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.
2391	She has worked hard on this, and I think wants to be involved and participatory.
2391	I had the sense that she was feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a piece of the presentation for Thursday.
2391	I was sensing that she was frustrated.
2391	Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on his plate right now.
2391	My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given the nature of group dynamic.
2391	I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which is a pretty good goal to go after.
2391	Thanks a bunch for the note.
2391	Best, Jeff
2392	Sorry.
2392	Don't work.
2392	I can do 1:45 California time, or after 3:15 California time.
2392	Or 12:15 California time.
2392	Or before 11:30 AM California time.
2392	Thanks.
2393	I'm the lower right hand corner of the matrix (which I think, is like, ENTJ, or ENTP, or something), which I think translates to anarchist....
2394	Please include Sue on the call-in info.
2394	Thanks.
2394	Best, Jeff
2395	Carolyn: I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.
2395	It's clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I apologize.
2395	You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.
2395	At some point, though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.
2395	Seems to me that, in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what groups and compromises are all about.
2395	After all, it's school.
2395	We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.
2395	Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.
2395	For my part, I felt that I pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much use going to the mat.
2395	Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has been, well, bumpy.
2395	But thanks very much for all the work you did.
2395	It was important, and the presentation is better off for it.
2395	Best, Jeff
2396	In all week (as best I can tell right now).
2397	u still on call w/Edison?
2397	jeff
2398	when u get a chance, can you call and let me know how it went?
2398	thanks.
2398	jeff
2399	Dude: Two things.
2399	First, in the midst of the craziness on Friday, my black, Northface parka ended up getting put someplace at Sarah's that I wasn't privvy to, and consequently I couldn't find it.
2399	My house keys are in it, so it would great to get it back.
2399	Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if it's floating around someplace over there?
2399	Muchos gracias.
2399	Second, could you do me a favor?
2399	Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?
2399	Sorry to be a pain in the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to manage it that way (at least from my end).
2399	And to be an even bigger pain.....since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close, could you stick the check in the mail?
2399	My address is: 366 Dolores St., #3 SF, 94110 Sorry for all the hassle.
2399	Happy birthday, man.
2399	Best, Jeff
2400	Do you have a copy of the order?
2401	Here are my comments.
2401	Great job.
2401	I think that the rate design table is a little impenetrable for folks who ain't close to it.
2401	It might benefit from an addition bullet of explanation.
2401	Best, Jeff
2402	You have specific questions about the order?
2402	Perhaps the best thing to do is jot down the specific questions, then we can route them to folks in the know (which is likely to be more than one person).
2402	That make any sense?
2403	FYI.
2403	Her take on the Senate going after the creditors' dedicated rate component as the first (and most important) change is on target in my view.
2403	Best, Jeff
2404	FYI.
2404	From our folks in Sacramento: AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.
2404	It's not an emergency bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer.
2404	AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be "regulated."
2404	Also no an emergency bill.
2404	AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.
2404	Best, Jeff
2405	My apologies for getting the sponsor incorrect.
2405	I'll notify folks.
2405	We'll need to discuss tomorrow on the call what position, if any, we (Enron) takes vis-a-vis New Power's attempts to get default provider.
2405	Thanks very much for the info.
2405	Best, Jeff
2406	Apologies.
2406	The competitive default provider bill is actually being sponsored by our brave compatriots at The New Power Company.
2406	Best, Jeff
2407	Carolyn: If you'd planned on making a chart similar to the one that you did previously, the symbols are STISPBEVA for the S&P 500 beverage index and ?STISPFOOD for the S&P 500 food index.
2407	Best, Jeff
2408	You available to talk today?
2409	I'll be going to everything, whether it makes sense or not, and spending a lot of money.
2410	Thanks, man.
2410	Up until the trauma and the drama (the genesis of which remains a mystery), I had a great time.
2410	Please thank Sarah and Bob---great food, great company, etc. Tell them sorry for leaving all my stuff lying around.
2410	Thanks for sending a single check.
2410	$736 is the amount.
2410	Talk to you soon.
2410	Best, Jeff
2411	My apologies.
2411	It ain't proofed.
2411	Let me know if this is what you're looking for.
2411	Best, Jeff
2412	While I, too, am frustrated at how things turned out, I'm glad your content overall with the course.
2412	Definitely one of the best--if not THE best--classes I've taken.
2412	I really think that we need to get together tomorrow nite to finalize, but I don't feel like pushing it too much.
2412	Your thoughts?
2412	Best, Jeff
2413	Hi.
2413	Is there a reason I keep getting this stuff from these guys.
2413	Sincerely, Clueless
2414	I'm available.
2415	Nice job.
2415	You take a self-promotion course over the weekend?
2416	I love you very much and of course want to be together, but some things need to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with those incidents.
2416	They have to stop.
2416	I have never been embarrassed to be with you.
2416	I'm as proud as can be.
2416	I think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on, but I'm willing to help.
2416	I don't want to end anything, but we need to fix it, or we'll have have to end it.
2416	I love you and miss you.
2417	FYI.
2417	Bob Williams should be touching base with you; or it would be useful for you to touch base with him.
2417	Edison appears to be staking out it's negotiating position with us through their filing.
2417	In short, they "recalculate" the PX credit post-Jan.
2417	19 (when DWR took over procurement).
2417	That recalculation turns our $125 MM dollar PX credit claim into $63MM.
2417	So we're pretty far apart.
2417	We agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say: 1) through the end of the rate freeze, or end of 3.31.02, the status quo remains--"PX credit" based on market price (Dow Jones index).
2417	2) however, if you want to go "utility purchase" price as the basis for the credit, then it must be the utility's full cost of power (retained gen+QFs+DWR+ISO real time).
2417	3) negative credit during the transition can still occur.
2417	3) Edison's proposal should be rejected.
2417	Best, Jeff
2418	The "big" meetings, which happen about every quarter, are de rigeur.
2418	The summer "big" meeting is an absolute must (and generally very fun).
2418	I'll be there.
2418	Hope you're there, too.
2418	Best, Jeff
2419	Plz look up decision no.
2419	01-04-006 on the commission's website.
2419	it has to do with interruptible and curtailment issues and rotating outages, i.e., blackouts.
2419	Thanks a million, Jeff
2420	Carpenter is saying that prices went up due to manipulation, pure and simple, we're saying that it's the reasons listed on the 1 1/2 pager that I sent.
2420	Give a call and we can discuss further.
2420	Best, Jeff
2421	Greetings: Could you email me the final version of the stipulation.
2421	Thanks a lot.
2421	Best, Jeff
2422	FYI.
2423	FYI.
2423	Might be useful to have the bill forwarded to the larger group, in addition to Gavin.
2423	Best, Jeff
2424	Thanks.
2424	Please also fax copies to Jim and Rick in Houston at 713.646.8160.
2424	Best, Jeff
2425	The interim settlement never got voted out.
2425	Therefore it ain't official, so there's no requirement yet to refile anything.
2425	(Welcome to California.) In fact, folks are still trying to get the Commission to reject the IS and approve the one that we worked on (though the chances of that are not huge, at this point).
2425	Give a holler if there's anything else.
2425	Best, Jeff
2426	Greetings all: I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to all this evening.
2426	I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.
2426	Apologies.
2426	But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to ensure that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what slides they're responsible for presenting, etc. What about lunch tomorrow (we're all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?
2426	Lemme know.
2426	Best, Jeff
2427	could you send my the slides that you put together on Saturday?
2427	Muchas Best, Jeff
2428	Greetings Ms Hunter: I'll be participating via conference call.
2428	Best, Jeff
2429	Works for me.
2430	Vicki must be tired of me being the perpetual bearer of bad tidings...
2430	You bet.
2430	You want to call me at my office?
2430	Best, Jeff
2431	Actually, could you call me on my cell phone @ 415.505.6633?
2431	Best, Jeff
2432	I cleaned this up a little bit.
2432	Best, Jeff
2433	merci.
2434	Can't wait to meet the little bundle of joy.
2435	Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).
2435	The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).
2435	Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.
2435	Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.
2435	Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
2435	They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to "obscene" levels).
2435	That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.
2435	Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.
2435	It's attached.
2435	Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.
2435	Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.
2435	Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.
2435	Best, Jeff
2436	Presume we'll talk tomorrow re: Cal solution?
2436	jeff 415.782.7822.
2437	Harry: Per my voicemail.
2437	Let's talk first thing in the AM to discuss.
2437	Best, Jeff
2438	Here's the ratio analysis.
2438	Let me know if you'd like me to put it into a text table for the presentation.
2438	Best, Jeff
2439	It was only a draft.
2439	The commission has to vote it out for it to become effective.
2439	They've delayed doing that.
2439	Therefore it's status quo on the SoCalGas system.
2440	Apologies.
2440	My schedule's been difficult to control.
2440	I am in fact in the office this morning, so you can call me here at 415.782.7822.
2440	Best, Jeff
2441	Yes, I can do the call.
2442	Wanted to make sure u knew: S&P downgraded CA rating--two notches--from AA to A+.
2442	Only Louisiana is lower.
2442	AND S&P kept CA on cred.
2442	watch--could go lower.
2442	It's slipping thru Davis' fingers.
2442	Jeff
2443	Also, talked to M. Day.
2443	those one-pagers should be coming in the next hour.
2444	I have one: Houston's coming to town for a meeting on Friday, the 4th.
2445	I'll be there about ten after 12.
2445	Here are some minor comments I have on the presentation.
2445	I'm going to try to go thru the rest and give any final comments by 8 PM tonite.
2445	Or maybe we can do that over lunch.
2445	Best, Jeff Slide #1 Coke,s acquisition of Quaker Oats: Why did it fizzle?
2445	=15 In November 2000, Coke offered to purchase Quaker Oats for $15.75 biin stock.
2445	=15 In December 2000, Coke withdrew its offer.
2445	=15 The press and analysts credit Warren Buffet, Coke,s largest shareholder, with killing the deal.
2445	Was Buffet right to kill the deal?
2445	Slide #2 Summary of Deals [[Need to put labels on each of the deal values.
2445	I think that this slideshould go after the &History of Deal8 slide.]] Slide #3 History of Deal Need dates: Pepsi offers OAT rejects Pepsi KO offers 15.75 B KO withdraws offer8
2446	Thank you for helping on this.
2447	chk email.
2447	memo from Day just arrived.
2447	Best, Jeff
2448	No thanks necessary.
2448	My pleasure.
2448	Hope that it helped.
2448	What was the gist of his comments regarding the gas side?
2448	Best, Jeff
2449	If Ken Lay's going to be in Sac, seems that he should meet with John Burton.
2449	You agree?
2449	Jeff
2450	You're a saint(esse).
2451	Yes.
2452	i wouldn't worry about that....
2453	If Ken Lay's going to Sac to have meetings, seems that he should meet w/Burton.
2453	You agree?
2453	Thx, Jeff
2454	Thanks very much for helping arrange the meetings.
2454	Here is the list thus far.
2454	There may be additions.
2454	I've also suggested dates for the meetings.
2454	May 3rd in Sacramento (after the meeting with David Freeman): Governor Davis (he spends a lot of time in Los Angeles and you may find that he prefers to meet there).
2454	House Speaker Robert Hertzberg House Republican member John Campbell (Republican's point person on energy issues) House Minority Leader David Cox Senate Majority Leader John Burton Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte May 4th--Morning, in Los Angeles John Bryson, CEO Edison International Governor Davis (unless the meeting occurs on the 3rd in Sacramento) May 4th--Afternoon, in San Francisco Bob Glynn, CEO PG&E Joseph Alamo from our office will provide you with the phone numbers for John Campbell, David Cox, John Burton, and Jim Brulte.
2454	I assume that your office has the numbers for John Bryson and Bob Glynn.
2454	If you do not have the numbers, let me know and I will get them for you.
2454	Thanks again for your help.
2454	Best, Jeff
2455	call when you're ready to start up again.
2455	jeff
2456	make sense to do this if sanders can't make it?
2456	jeff
2457	Got your message.
2457	Thanks.
2457	I think that 2 hours is the most we'll want to take with Freeman.
2457	Might be shorter, but I can't imagine that it would go any longer.
2457	Best, Jeff
2458	note from linda sez he can't make it.

2459	You got it.
2460	Thanks.

2465	Let's get back together first thing in the AM to finish the "solutions" doc.
2465	I've done some more editing.
2465	Off now to school stuff.
2465	Jeff
2466	Here are my brief edits to the presentation--added a couple of bullets to the Quaker slide and tightened up the deal summary slide.
2466	Also attaching a word doc of additional info for everyone for use during the presentation and Q&A.
2466	Also attached is the deal comps table.
2466	Best, Jeff
2467	hey buddie.
2467	our stock's up (so FERC order ain't so bad?).
2467	w/the lay thing, Vickie's memo's gotta wait.
2467	You concur.
2467	best,jeff
2468	thanks.
2468	jeff
2469	poor thing.
2469	what else is there after dual 790s?
2470	looking at it right now.
2471	One minor edit---it's the PX, not the ISO, that's taken itself into voluntary bankruptcy.
2471	See redline version attached.
2471	Only other comment: I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks enter into transactions with NYMEX).
2471	(See opening line of last paragraph.) We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide particular issues.
2471	In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other counter parties via the PX market mechanism.
2471	That said, seems to me that, for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise the flag.
2471	Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.
2471	Hope this helps.
2471	Best, Jeff
2472	I thought that you're going to be at pacbell park all weekend.
2473	Greetings folks: Just checking in to see how we're doing and if folks got the files that I sent last night.
2473	Should we try to meet at 5:30 to do a final run through?
2473	I think that we might be the very first presentation (yikes).
2473	Best, Jeff
2474	Greetings Ms Guerrero: I'd suggest that we set up the briefing with Ken for Tuesday afternoon, given that we've got a lot to do between now and then.
2474	Best, Jeff
2475	Thanks a bunch for all the work you've done on this bloody thing.
2475	Best, Jeff
2476	FYI.
2476	As you recall, based on the meeting that I attended at SVMG with Karen Denne and Jeff Skilling, they put me on their internal distribution list (though I'm not sure that they realize it).
2476	Here's the latest from Carl Guardino, the groups Exec Dir, and Davis appointee to the ISO.

2479	Jim: Am doing my final edits to solutions.
2479	Know Jen and Robert are still working, but I'm continuing through.
2479	Will email to you within hour.
2479	Then turning to SCE MOU.
2479	Best, Jeff
2480	electronically tagged prior to departure, though, I'm sure.
2480	Hey, did you sent the check yet?
2480	(signed, scrooge)
2481	ain't got anything yet.
2481	you get the stuff that i sent last nite?
2482	Yeah, gave the disc to Prentice.
2482	Also (and don't ask me how this happened, cuz I couldn't tell ya), Cameron put the battery to her camera (I think?) in my shirt pocket.
2482	I gave that to Prentice last night, too.
2482	So she's got both of them.
2482	Thanks a million (or at least $736) for the check.
2482	Best, Jeff
2483	call me on my cell phone (415.505.6633) when you get a chance.
2483	thx, jeff
2484	Looks good to me.
2484	See you at 5:30 at Mr. Beans.

2485	Best, Jeff
2486	CEO of Edison.
2487	Buddie: Solutions doc is in your in-box.
2487	I'm moving on to SCE MOU analysis.
2487	Call if need anything.
2487	Best, Jeff
2488	You gotta go.
2489	Don't have my car here.
2489	Planned on taking BART, but if possible, might be useful to carpool--give us additional time to discuss the presentation.
2489	I'm game.
2489	Best, Jeff
2490	yes, you ain't seen it?
2491	faxed at noon california time.
2492	Greetings Rosie: As you confirm meetings with Mr. Lay next week, could you drop a line to Maureen, Janel and me?
2492	Thanks very much.
2492	Best, Jeff
2493	let me see what i can do.
2494	I think that there's something wrong with your email..
2494	I'll be at market and best,
2495	what time you picking up?
2496	Thanks.
2496	If you'd like to have a conversation that doesn't include the whole gang on the conference call about the Brattle Group stuff, give me a call and we can have a calmer, more detailed discussion without all the noise.
2496	Best, Jeff
2497	thank you.
2497	nice job on the call today.
2498	FYI.
2498	This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting groupthat Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to the legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the CaliforniaBorder.
2498	The day following this presentation (which was followed by a presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called ElPaso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's presentations.
2498	Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I'veseen in the press.
2498	Best, Jeff Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in thestate,s current energy crisis.
2498	In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leaneheavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utilitySouthern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.
2498	But the state,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso NatuGas -- is not ready to take the rap.
2498	The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which irecently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.
2498	As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CPare pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California bordeprices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding.
2498	And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Group,s study of the California market.
2498	Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairmanof the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle Group,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was notcaused by normal market forces (GD 4/20).
2498	His remarks followed an oversight hearing duringwhich Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement inthe California market.
2498	El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly.
2498	In a reporpresented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergenceof factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.
2498	Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Paso to conduct work on several fronts.
2498	In its study of the California market, Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of themain culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.
2498	Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,said he "didn,t see any smoking gun" in either report.
2498	"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I,m not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell said.
2498	"I believe FERC is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that,s theappropriate place."
2498	Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature togive support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It,s being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said. The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level: "There,s a concerted effort, not just on natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point thefinger elsewhere for the problems that we,re having in this state and I think you,re seeing some of that with the public utilities commission."
2498	Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies seem to have taken on a life of their own. The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavilylitigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round outThe Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading. Several parties resisted FERC,s call for market information, saying therequested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restrictingaccess to evidence Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in theircase. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of alarge block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC,s recent ruling on thCalifornia border controversy obviated the need for more investigation. The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered ahearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to drivup the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take placethis summer. (RP00-
2499	Just for the record, I just reviewed my "Jeff's Goals for 2001" that Paul and I worked up, and "doing time for the company" didn't make the list this year.
2499	Paul, I double-checked and "dating Loretta Lynch" is, likewise, not on the list.
2499	Best, Jeff
2500	There a call-in number for this?
2501	I'll make sure that you're on this distribution list (you're not currently on it, right?).
2501	Best, Jeff
2502	FYI.
2502	Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group already running mock "black out" drills.
2502	Best, Jeff
2503	Thanks to all.
2503	Ended up working out pretty well.
2503	We may have been the only folks thus far that finished within 20 minutes (or 45 minutes, it seems, for that matter).
2503	Best, Jeff
2504	you still ain't got it?
2504	I sent it to you twice yesterday.
2504	You think we have an email problem?
2504	Best, Jeff
2505	The Bryson meeting will likely be Steve and Ken, or me and Steve and Ken---at least that's the poop that I've received thus far.
2505	Best, Jeff
2506	Give me a call.
2506	I'm thinking that from your note, the CA meetings are getting in your way.
2506	I was hoping that KL could meet with Bryson on the 4th, but looks like they already scheduled.
2506	I just want to make sure that Rosie doesn't get all crossed up with many of us sending her stuff.
2506	Let's talk and maybe I can get the Bryson meeting rearranged.
2506	Your pal, Jeff
2507	Hey buddy: I'm going to have to bail on the solutions doc at this point so that I can focus on the backgrounder, the MOU and the buy down.
2507	Also, I'll be in Houston on Monday.
2507	Best, Jeff
2508	you get a chance to see the work that I did on the document and sent you yesterday?
2509	Hi: I'm going to call you in a bit--I'm on a conference call right now.
2509	We need to coordinate just a wee bit.
2509	Landwehr's all over Rosie, and we're getting mixed up between her RGA meetings and the CA meetings.
2509	I talked to her a little this AM and expressed a concern that we not get poor Rosie all wrapped around an axle and confused.
2509	We may have several points of contact here for various issues.
2509	No big deal, but I want to make sure things don't get more complicated than they need to be.
2509	I'll forward you a note from Sue to Rosie (and me) that you weren't on.
2509	Also want to talk about your voicemail last night--i.e., I may need to travel with KL, which is fine by me if that's necessary.
2509	Best, Jeff
2510	Thanks.

2516	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California.
2516	Executive Order D-34-01 Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago.
2516	Executive Order D-34-01 will speed up implementation of the measures.
2516	Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this summer.
2516	With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding.
2516	The programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included: Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA); Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters; Municipal Program; and Cool Roofs/Building Materials Executive Order D-33-01 Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation rebate of the "20/20" program to the customers in the territory serviced by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company.
2516	The program is designed to help the state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who significantly conserve energy.
2516	In addition, it could save the state up to $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state must buy during expensive summer peak periods.
2516	Executive Order D-32-01 In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation of the power plant construction incentive program.
2516	Incentives will include: $5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001; $4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and August 1, 2001; and $3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and Executive Order D-32-01 Executive Order D-33-01 Executive Order D-34-01
2517	Talked to Les.
2517	give a call and i can fill you in. Best, Jeff
2518	you ever get the Brattle prez?
2518	jeff
2519	are u serious?
2519	jeff
2520	let me no when you hear from SK re: accompany lay, so i can re-arrange schedule if necessary.
2520	thx,jeff (want to see if you really wear pager :))
2521	u ah dead.
2522	I'm assuming that you're in the loop on this decision making?
2522	Best, Jeff
2523	i got an email bounced back from your address.
2523	let me know if you get this one.
2524	Greetings: On the call between Ken Lay and Bob Hertzberg, Hertzberb asked us to resend any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.
2524	I've combined our on-line auction proposal with the "federal" solution recently worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California consumption).
2524	Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in Washington next week.
2524	Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office today.
2524	Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before COB?
2524	Thanks very much.
2524	Best, Jeff
2525	I have cleared my calendar, so any time in the morning works for me.
2525	Best, Jeff
2526	Here's the final that Scott Governar will deliver to Hertzberg today.
2526	Best, Jeff
2527	Thank you.
2527	What's "the report."
2527	Best, Jeff
2528	u need to participate by phone if you can.
2528	Best, Jeff
2529	Thanks very much.
2529	I think, rather than Crawford, you might be referring to David Cox, Republican leader of the California Assembly?
2529	Really can't thank you enough for you help on this.
2529	Have a great weekend.
2529	Best, Jeff
2530	FYI.
2530	given this info, there's a chance that i might try to get in. how's the sign-u look at this point?
2530	Best, Jeff
2531	Dudes: I'm am officially responsible for the case and of course appreciate all Dylan's (and everyone else's) efforts.
2531	Here's my game plan.
2531	I'm going to spend the day working on it---adding to what's already been passed around.
2531	Dylan, I'll look at the numbers and perhaps send you (and others) thoughts regarding the crunching, since you've already starting crunching.
2531	I'll try to do as much of the write-up (building on what others have done) and send around by COB today.
2531	Once everyone's had a chance to comment, etc. I'll finalize tomorrow night.
2531	I have to fly to Houston at the crack of dawn on Monday and therefore can't go to class, so I'm hoping that someone else can turn it in. Let me know if this works for folks.
2531	Best, Jeff
2532	Thanks.
2532	If you need to talk just page me at 888.916.7184.
2532	Best, Jeff
2533	Here's the gov's analysis of the MOU.
2533	Have a good weekend.
2533	Best, Jeff
2534	Left you a voicemail last nite.
2534	I get on the plane Houston at 6:30 AM PDT, so you'll have to do it solo.
2534	I'll get to the office around 130-200.
2534	I'll come to your office and you can fill me in on how it went.
2534	Best, Jeff
2535	OK Gang: Well, I,ve been crunching numbers all day, and haven,t yet gotten to the writing.
2535	I've attached Dylan's original responses for reference.
2535	Figureit'll be a memo from Time's CEO to the Time Board.
2535	I,ve leaving now for Mendocino, but will be back early tomorrow to finisthis up.
2535	Please check out the spreadsheet.
2535	The case is sort of confusing*how do Time,s analysts value Time at $1when they,re trading at 109 the day before the announcement of the deal with Warner.
2535	That doesn,t jive.
2535	Are they saying that, absent synergies, thecombined Time/Warner is worth the enterprise value of Time at 189-212 plusthe enterprise value of Warner at $63-71 (again, the analysts valuation)?
2535	That just seems ridiculous, give where they,re trading.
2535	Anyway, here,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if I,m smoking crack.
2535	The deal isn,t really $175 per share.
2535	It,s $175 LESS the taxes that will have to paid (since it,s a purchase deal) PLUS the value of the tax shiecreated by the net increase of $8.9B in new debt that Paramount will takeon.
2535	Does this seem right?
2535	Could folks look at my spreadsheet?
2535	I,ve got it conceptually set up, but I,m not quite sure how to calculate the taxes paid under the purchase method or the value of the tax shield (assuming that thiis correct. If I,m just completely out of it with this angle, just let me know. In any case, seems that there,s some value in the tax-free (Time-Warner) versus the taxable (Time-Paramount) deals. Presumably, we could take the total enterprise value of Time-Warner (nontaxed) and compareit to the total enterprise of Paramount-Time (taxed) and compare the two. ve got a hunch that the Time-Warner number may win the day, but I haven,gotten that far in the crunching yet. In any case, I,ll be back around Noon tomorrow and will crank the puppy out. Best, Jeff
2536	Thanks to all for your comments.
2536	I've tried to weave together the various (and insightful) comments I received from folks with the great stuff that Dylan put together initially and the stuff that I whipped up.
2536	They're attached.
2536	Please proof the thing---I fear that there's a typo, or two.
2536	Since I'm off to beatiful Houston at the crack of dawn, Dylan has graciously agreed to take any further comments, integrate them, and print the final thing out to turn in at class tomorrow.
2536	Thanks a million, Dylan.
2536	You folks should discuss whether you want to include the Excel exhibits as I've included them in the memo---no pride of ownership, so don't be timid.
2536	Dylan, they are formatted for printing, so all you should have to do is print away.
2536	See you all soon.
2536	Best, Jeff
2537	I'd vote to let Hap do it.
2538	Ms Fleming: No apologies necessary.
2538	Anybody would be confused with what we've thrown at you.
2538	Just to be sure, it's David Cox (new Republican leader in the Assembly) and John Campbell (Republican Assemblyman).
2538	Can't thank you enough for you help.
2538	Hope you had a nice weekend.
2538	Jeff
2539	Yes (sort of).
2539	I'm in Houston.
2539	Up on 47.
2539	What's up?
2540	Hey!
2540	I'm in Houston.
2540	You'll have my backgrounder tomorrow.
2540	(The way things are going today, I'll be working on it till the wee hours tonite.) Best, Jeff
2541	You can reach me on my pager at 888.916.7184, and during the day, Ginger and Maureen can get a hold of me as well.
2541	All the offices in the Capitol are in the same building--so it's possible to get from one to other in about 5 minutes.
2541	If there's anything else, don't hesitate to contact me.
2541	Best, Jeff
2542	Yep.
2543	So was his angle, the shareholders should take the $175 and run?
2544	there was a strong case for that.
2544	only thing preventing was the internal DCF of the time-warner deal being 183-212 (or something)---so why didn't the market put that value on it?
2544	I went with what i thought the flow of the group was, but it was a tough row to hoe.
2544	where were you on it?
2545	Thank you, Rosalee.
2545	Best, Jeff
2546	FYI.
2546	Karen, can you forward along to Marathon.

2550	Best, Jeff
2551	Greetings: Joe, I just ran into some El Paso guys that I know (I'm in L.A.) and asked them about the Lukens study.

2551	They intend to submit it with their testimony in the FERC case.

2554	I registered for 1-unit courses, but have not "signed up" in the office.

2555	Thanks man.
2555	Jeff
2556	I am available for the meeting.
2557	Thank you very much for the briefing paper.
2557	Best, Jeff
2558	FYI.
2559	As of right now, I'm available, but with the crisis in California, I might be called away.
2559	At this point, though, I'm clear and will plan on meeting.
2559	My apologies for the uncertainty.
2559	Best, Jeff
2560	Thanks for the note.
2560	We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the electricity crisis in municipalization). If spun right, could provide an interesting opportunity, however. Best, Jeff
2561	Are you working on this bill for Wild Goose?
2562	I'm available if needed.

2565	FYI: I'm scheduled to meet with CMA and the Chamber on Monday to discuss the comprehensive solution and urge them to support it.
2565	Best, Jeff
2566	You're welcome, but no need for thanks.
2566	I was just telling it like it is.
2566	You do a great job for us, and we appreciate it a lot.
2566	I'm going to be up on there on Monday.

2566	Thanks.

2567	Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue Book).
2567	He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.
2567	He was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to Glynn at this morning's meeting.
2567	He was particularly positive about the core/noncore proposal.
2567	He asked to meet to discuss it further.
2567	I have an appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.
2567	He offered--as a board member of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass.
2567	I'll report back after the meeting.
2567	And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.
2567	Will report back on the meetings.
2567	Have a good weekend.
2567	Best, Jeff
2568	Hi folks: Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.
2568	Worse, some nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's worth of work and school gone, kaputt. Anyway, if there's any chance that someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would be greatly indebted. Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday. Best, Jeff
2569	Seems that Fergus' folks should be able to get their hands on it.
2570	Folks: Let me know if this captures the results of the conversation on Friday.
2570	Best, Jeff Basics of Proposal Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's contracts) Concessions -IOUs (MOU modifications) -Generators (past due amounts) -investigations Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit securitization) Message This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that will see us.
2570	We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with our proposal We intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution---it's vital, and time's running out Corporate leader strategy---Karen Denne Meetings with legislators in Sacramento---Sandi McCubbin WPTF, IEP, ARM---Sue Mara
2571	Agreed.
2571	Great idea on characterizing it as a "melding."
2571	Need to fill you in on the "investigation" discussions with the Republicans in today's meeting with Lay.
2571	You still around?
2571	Best, Jeff
2572	This is real helpful.
2573	Thank you.
2574	Greetings Laura and Marybeth: Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation.
2574	I apologize for the brevity of this note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.
2574	In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of center).
2574	The deal would be bi-partisan.
2574	If successful, the deal would: Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right price signals for efficiency, but fall short of "shock therapy."
2574	Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates.
2574	Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate changes.
2574	Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market.
2574	NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).
2574	Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers.
2574	Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc. Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of "wise persons" to help get the deal done.
2574	L. Summers is willing; others are being considered.
2574	Your name has come up.
2574	But that issue can be addressed later.
2574	The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, which are breaking quickly.
2574	Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.
2574	Congratulations on Haas' #7 ranking in US News and World Report.
2574	Best, Jeff Office 415.782.7822 Pager 888.916.7184 Home 415.621.8317 Cell 415.505.6633

2577	Best, Jeff
2578	You got it.
2579	Agree with your suggestion on how to "re-package" the solution.
2579	They should write and call legislators and the governor and all sign a document endorsing it.

2580	Hi: Just got your page re: talk today at 2PM.
2580	I'm assuming that this note is no longer valid and that you're not trying to set something up for 2 PM tomorrow (Wednesday)?
2580	Thanks.
2580	Jeff
2581	What's Sunday?
2581	Would that be "frog gras?"
2582	Greetings: Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres.
2582	of the California Manufacturer's and Technology Ass.
2582	and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California Chamber of Commerce.
2582	Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information regarding the core/noncore proposal.
2582	We have a meeting set up for Thursday morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.
2582	Stewart will bring Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.
2582	Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.
2582	Though he, too, would like more details.
2582	Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read "grow up") and do a comprehensive deal.
2582	Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.
2582	We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support and pitch: 1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve this now, and 2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've described.
2582	They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly didn't reject the idea.
2582	Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.
2582	Best, Jeff
2583	I'm serious.
2583	Are you referring to the proposal that no one knows about that everyone knows about?
2583	We going to celebrate?
2584	Marybeth: My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter returning to Houston.
2584	Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, if that works with Laura.
2584	I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the information to you.

2606	some additional information beyond duh would be useful.
2607	shoot, we're going to see Tom and Karen on Saturday.
2608	FYI.
2608	Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).
2608	This is the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.
2608	Will check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes were made.
2608	Best, Jeff
2609	Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea (lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week: They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
2609	McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for core/noncore has a lot of merit.
2609	Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when the markets settle and prices come down, 2) everyone (core and noncore) should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects would be and would share it with them when we're done.
2609	While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the necessary support to get passed.
2609	They are also withholding final judgment until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
2609	They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge and Loretta Lynch.
2609	They place very little trust in the Governor or the Legislature.
2609	Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to CMA.
2609	Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.
2610	Don't know how I got on the list, but just got my invitation to the Western Conference of PUCs meeting June 3-6 where the guest speakers are Frank Wolak and Gary Locke.
2610	Oh dear....
2610	Best, Jeff
2611	Hi: please add $4 of tolls for each day that I went to Sac this week.
2611	Thanks, Jeff
2612	Wednesday works next week.
2612	But I warn you, I have NO control over my schedule these days, but I'm putting it on my calendar.
2612	Lemme know if that works for you guys.
2612	Best, Jeff
2613	yes.
2614	Can we have a call tomorrow to discuss status, etc.?
2614	10 AM Houston time work for folks?
2614	Best, Jeff
2615	yes.
2616	This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.
2616	Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a summary that we could provide him.
2616	Zaremberg is convinced that no one in California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.
2616	If we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing it to Zaremberg?
2616	Thanks.
2616	Best, Jeff
2617	your call, baby.
2618	hey, when are you scheduled to go in for your attitude labotomy?
2619	why?
2619	(touchee)
2620	yes.
2620	in fact, i suggested it.
2620	be great to book jim.
2620	thanks.
2621	Marybeth: I apologize.
2621	As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.
2621	I also mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got resolved.
2621	I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).
2621	It starts at 1PM.
2621	We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.
2621	I'm hoping--but not altogether hopeful---that the call will end before 2:30.
2621	I can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems, particularly since I'm the one who originated the request to chat with Laura.
2621	We can do it one of several ways; it's completely your call: 1) play it by ear, and I can let you know around 2:15 if I think the call's going to wrap up by 2:30.
2621	2) we can reschedule (I would of course very much like to brief Laura on what's going on).
2621	3) you can decide it's too much trouble and throw up your hands, which I would understand.
2621	Let me know how you 'd like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies (and best) to Laura.
2621	I have to get on the call right now, so if you need to speak to a live person, give Joseph a call at 415.782.7841.
2621	Best, Jeff
2622	Hi Alan: In our ongoing analysis of the MOU, and in our attempt to put together a solution for California, we need to do a reality check on the implied curves the Governor's consultants are using to arrive at their rate proposals.
2622	To ensure an "apples to apples" comparison, we're hoping to get our curve data for 24X7 power, averaged on a quarterly basis, from 2001-2010.
2622	Hoping that you can get that for us.
2622	That possible?
2622	Let me know.
2622	Thanks a bunch.
2622	Best, Jeff
2623	1) if he's got 30 minutes, then he should join for 30 minutes.
2623	2) quite urgent, since the analysis needs to be done pronto.
2623	3) if he can't join, that's ok.
2623	we can fill him after the meeting.
2624	I'm trapped.
2624	Could I impose upon you to buy me my usual burrito from downstairs before I pass out?
2624	Greatly appreciated.
2625	Thanks a bunch for your help with this.
2626	we should distribute our comprehensive proposal to this group.
2627	Marybeth: The call's ended and I'll be available for the 2:30 call.
2627	Best, Jeff
2628	Good job.
2628	It's got traction.
2628	Can you call when you get a chance to
2629	OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.
2629	Wanted to lay out the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is the analysis that you're already working on: Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
2629	Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 years).
2629	Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the short for the core) Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date. Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed. Thanks. Best, Jeff
2630	Hi Maureen: Could you ask Steve if he will be able to make the 4:30 (CST) with Laura Tyson?
2630	I think you 've got the call-in number.
2630	Tell him it's not big deal if he can't--I can handle--but if he can, it might be useful for him to be on the line.
2630	Thanks a bunch.
2630	Best, Jeff
2631	FYI.
2631	Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group ain't happy about the rate increas(surprise).
2632	So does this mean we're right where we left off with respect to status of bills like wind-fall profits, jails for generators, etc.?
2633	You are so sweet.
2633	Thank you.
2633	WHAT are you doing working so late????!!!!!
2634	See Riordon note below.
2635	Thank you.
2636	Will do.
2637	Great.
2637	Thanks.
2637	I intended, and will be sure, to include Karen on the stuff that I pull together today.
2637	Karen, if there's anything else I need to do to coordinate.
2637	Best, Jeff
2638	Take a look.
2638	Interesting stuff.
2638	I'd say it further adds to our momentum.
2639	I don't have an attachment.
2640	plz see email for hertzberg talking points for phone call.
2640	turning to CEO materials now.
2640	jeff
2641	This looks fantastic.
2641	I apologize profusely.
2641	I've got a dozen assigments to finish by COB.
2641	But having read this, you obviously needed no help from me.
2641	Let me know how the call with Riordan goes.
2641	Best, Jeff
2642	Got message re: letter from Sherman to OPIC.
2642	I'm in all day Monday.
2642	Best, Jeff
2643	Hi Maureen: Could you please make sure that Steve gets these?
2643	Thanks a bunch.
2643	Best, Jeff
2644	Michael: did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?
2644	I would worry about that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).
2644	I suggest that we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.
2644	Best, Jeff
2645	FYI, another arrow in our quiver: ?
2645	Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another downgrade.
2645	Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed California that "the only way the state will improve its credit rating and look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the
2646	Yes, please submit my name.
2646	Thanks a bunch.
2646	I'll be talking about everything.
2647	Bibi's the man---he's the guy I mentioned when we discussed the other night.
2648	can we use the MOU total load numbes (e.g., 93 GWH for PG&E) and divide it up using the proportions in the PG&E numbers?
2649	Greetings Piper: My name is Jeff Dasovich.
2649	I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.
2649	I think you've spoken with Karen Denne.
2649	Scott asked for some background materials on our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.
2649	I'll be forwarding those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.
2649	Does that work for you?
2649	Best, Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp
2650	agreed.
2651	Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.
2651	Said she'd heard that Ken Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron buying Edison's transmission system.
2651	I told her that Enron is not in the market for transmission systems.
2651	Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the nukes.
2651	Best, Jeff
2652	Amen.
2653	Please, please keep Dave out of it.
2653	Note to follow.
2654	It'll be to you in about 10-15 minutes.
2655	chk vmail when you get a chance.
2655	best,jeff
2656	You're much too kind.
2656	Thanks for the feedback.
2656	My brains just about spilled out end of the day Friday.
2656	Spent the weekend in a haze.
2656	Best, Jeff
2657	coincidentally i did see governor backbone on the show.
2657	i don't think that we can count on him toning it down anytime soon, which will not be helpful in getting a solution out here.
2657	best, Jeff
2658	I'll be on the call.
2658	Hope all's well on your end.
2658	Best, Jeff
2659	I saw "the event" re-reun on local cable access TV (randomly viewed on Saturday).
2659	It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!
2659	Unfortunately, I wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in order.
2659	Best, Jeff
2660	Thank you very much.
2660	Best, Jeff
2661	Hi Piper: The email I sent on Friday to Scott McNealy's address (listed below) got bounced back to me.
2661	Just wanted to make sure that you folks received the materials.
2661	Best, Jeff
2662	Greetings: As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.
2662	As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.
2662	McNealy and others have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try to advance the ball.
2662	I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all errors, omissions, ramblings, etc. Wanted to distribute, however, to make sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.
2662	Know folks are busy, but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.
2662	Best, Jeff
2663	I'll assume that you'll follow up with Piper on this?
2663	Best, Jeff
2664	Greetings: Can we meet at 5 pm CDT/3 PM PDT to see where we are on the analysis?
2664	Best, Jeff
2665	Hi Twanda: I can make the call.
2665	Best, Jeff
2666	Thank you again.
2667	From the Dow Jones Newswire:
2668	Thank.
2668	Talk to you then.
2668	Best, Jeff
2669	Your call.
2669	Let us know what we can do to help.
2669	Best, Jeff
2670	you getting pages in Tokyo?
2670	jeff
2671	thx for call.
2671	no about plan "B" but haven't seen anything on paper.
2671	jeff
2672	s.
2672	govenar is faxing me a copy.
2672	thx very much for the info.
2672	jeff
2673	Man, you rule!
2673	Good job.
2673	I'll give you a call.
2674	Thanks.
2674	Will be very interested to hear how the meeting goes.
2674	My sense is that the timing could be just about right.
2674	Best, Jeff
2675	I can make either time.
2675	Just let me know.
2675	Best, Jeff
2676	It was a beautiful day (and evening).
2676	Congratulations to you both.
2676	It is a very sweet thing for two very sweet people, and I'm sort of choked up for being asked to be in the wedding party.
2676	It was a great day for everybody.
2676	Congratulations.
2676	Best, Jeff Beware, the mighty reefer....
2677	Maureen: Few things.
2677	I was on the call with Steve today and he asked me to do a couple of things.
2677	1) Send a summary of today's call to the email list that you've put together.
2677	I've got the list from the note you forwarded to me with the call-in info for today's call.
2677	Is that the complete list?
2677	If not, could you foward me the most recent one, which I'll use to distribute the summary?
2677	2) Could you set up another call for this Friday (May 18th) for 60 minutes at 10 CDT/8 AM PDT, and distribute to the same bunch of folks that were on today's call?
2677	Thanks a million.
2677	Best, Jeff
2678	FYI.
2678	Best, Jeff
2679	Got a message from PG&E.
2679	Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll be accepting bids up to 30 years.
2679	Will talk to PG&E and get back with more information.
2679	If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.
2679	Best,
2680	FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail that wags the dog.
2680	P.S.
2680	I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.
2680	Looks like about $75K for three months.
2680	Best, Jeff
2681	Great suggestions.
2681	Thanks so much for the help.
2681	Best, Jeff
2682	FYI.
2683	I can do tomorrow.
2684	Thanks a million.
2684	FYI, I meant to send you a "thank you" note in response to the note with Friday call-in info, but it went to Steve instead.
2684	Best, Jeff
2685	Message(s) received loud and clear.
2685	I'll await Paul's email and proceed according to that plan.
2685	Best, Jeff
2686	Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get as many people as possible to do the same.
2686	Let's face it, California's gas industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess (despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning offered by the Brattle Group).
2686	The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps back.
2686	Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call them and try to get them to show up in support?
2686	Best, Jeff
2687	How's this look?
2687	Steve Kean Rick Shapiro (GA) Paul Kaufman (GA) Vicki Sharpe (EES) Mike D. Smith (EES) Karen Denne (PA)
2688	Thanks.
2688	I'll get you one more name then.
2688	FYI: To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted."
2688	I'm on a litigation call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched out Scott Governor yesterday).
2688	On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes yesterday."
2688	I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to fax it to the San Francisco office.
2688	Unreal....
2688	Best, Jeff
2689	Thanks Robert: One caution.
2689	It's important that the first-cut analysis be "simple" and uses, to the maximum extent possible, the MOU numbers and modeling.
2689	This allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily "numbers oriented" and to do so with an "apples-to-apples" comparison.
2689	That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of "here's what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model."
2689	That said, I understand that even with the simple base case, some tweeks are likely.
2689	Talk to you in an hour.
2689	Thanks again for the help.
2689	Best, Jeff
2690	I am on back to back conference calls.
2690	What would you like me to do to help get materials prepared for Ken Lay?
2690	I'm available at about 11:45 AM my time if you'd like to try to talk then.
2690	Just let me know.
2690	Best, Jeff
2691	What are the details for tomorrow?
2692	Looks complete to me.
2692	No comments.
2692	Best, Jeff
2693	sorry to bother you with this, but could you please fax me the governor's response to plan B?
2693	thx, jeff
2694	My apologies in the delay getting this to you.
2694	Best, Jeff
2695	Was a pleasure.
2695	Never hesitate to get in touch if you need anything.
2695	Best of luck.
2695	Look forward to working with you folks.
2695	Best, Jeff
2696	As always, can't thank you enough.
2696	I get the sense that Loretta's decision will have to get somewhat friendlier to business (and our poor economy).
2696	Best, Jeff
2697	CTO or CIO, or both.
2697	Phillip is first name.
2698	You going to brief me tonite on tomorrow's meeting?
2699	You did an absolutely fabulous job on Sunday.
2699	It was a great time, the food was extraordinary, and the wine was better still.
2699	Thanks so much for it all.
2699	You're very sweet.
2699	Almost makes any more engagements superfluous, don't you think.
2699	(kidding!) Don't forget to water the tomatoes!
2699	Best, Jeff
2700	Thanks for the commnets, Lynn.
2700	I've faxed you a copy of "Plan B."
2700	I'll let others chime in, but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed, comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion.
2700	But at a minimum we'd want to get "the process" nailed down by very early next week.
2700	Best, Jeff
2701	Thanks very much.
2702	i won.
2703	"Plan B" As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that has been working on a "Plan B."
2703	They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's MOU with Edison.
2703	The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU.
2703	First the good news about Plan B: a fairly bright group of legislators is rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be bi-partison about it.
2703	(There is at least one idea in Plan B that is attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis may be emerging.
2703	Now the bad news: because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to require a lot more work to get right.
2703	Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable.
2703	On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it to the Legislature to take the lead role.
2703	The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter.
2703	Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of the discount that suppliers would be willing to take.
2703	The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable.
2703	The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the process of negotiations underway.
2703	Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power deals with CDWR.
2703	It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps.
2703	Finally, there's been some confusion.
2703	My apologies.
2703	Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."
2703	Sandi mentioned that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.
2703	For those that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to the back of the Plan.
2703	The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).
2703	Joe Fichera is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor hired to advise him on the crisis.
2703	If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll get it to you.
2703	Best, Jeff
2704	No problem.
2704	We will fax it to you.
2704	Best, Jeff
2705	What wine tasting?
2706	Greetings.
2706	Will there be a call-in number?
2706	Best, Jeff
2707	never mind.
2707	I actually bothered to read the ENTIRE note and answered by own question.
2707	Apologies.
2707	Best, Jeff
2708	Sorry, but thanks.
2709	FYI.
2710	I'll be here.
2711	Very nice touch; particularly the opening paragraph.
2711	You do good memos.
2711	Should one expect any fireworks?
2711	Best, Jeff
2712	Hi Maureen: Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.
2712	The letter 1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key components of a comprehensive solution.
2712	Could you please get a copy of the letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken Lay?
2712	Thanks very much for your help.
2712	Best, Jeff
2713	I'll buckle up.
2713	P.S.
2713	1Scott faxed you a letter from Cox and Brulte to Hertzberg and Burton.
2713	Check it out.
2713	It's a pretty darned smart letter: 1) very cooperative 2) substantively attractive and rational.
2713	Best, Jeff
2714	Sorry I had to get off the call early.
2714	Hope it helped.
2714	If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
2714	Best, Jeff
2715	yep.
2715	it's on its way.
2716	aye aye.
2717	FYI: Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis.
2717	The administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.
2717	They were shooting for this Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.
2717	Go figure.
2717	Best, Jeff
2718	Thank you for the feedback.
2718	We're "sanitizing" the document a wee bit (taking out the "opposing view--response" part).

2740	jeff
2741	PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
2741	It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
2741	The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
2741	The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
2741	Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
2741	Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
2741	Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
2741	About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed "Gas Accord II," (the first one expires end of 02).
2741	As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
2741	PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
2741	In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
2741	The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
2741	How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
2741	No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).
2741	Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.
2741	If you have any questions, just holler.
2741	Best, Jeff
2742	it was really good.
2742	how'd you cut up those damned potatoes like that?
2743	u up for going to the dome wednesday night?

2747	Michael Tribolet and I (about 99% Michael) have put together a rough cut analysis of the core/noncore structure, and some scenarios Hertzberg has asked for.
2747	Hertzberg's expecting some info from us on Monday (and I'm sure that he'll want more scenarios, too).
2747	Are you available first thing Monday morning to be briefed on the analysis, my conversations with Hertzberg, what Hertzberg's strategy is, etc.?
2748	Can you talk early Monday AM w/me & Tribolet re: core/noncore analysis for Hertzberg?

2752	Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the issue......
2752	Davis announces four new energy advisors Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.
2752	Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new director of communications.
2752	Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.
2752	Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.
2752	McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal regulators and with generators.
2752	Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.
2752	Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, Maviglio said.
2752	-- Associated Press
2753	No word from Steve.
2753	Ken thought the meetings were very worthwhile, though he was pooped by the time he got to the airport.
2753	We laughed (cried?) about Riordan during the car ride.
2753	Best, Jeff
2754	8:30 AM PDT, every monday.
2754	be great if you could join regularly.
2754	Best, Jeff
2755	Nice job.
2755	Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market power under every rock and in every pipeline.
2755	I think there's a chance that someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.
2755	Might want to say "significant supplier" or something similar.
2755	No big deal, but I thought I'd flag it for your consideration.
2755	Best, Jeff
2756	Yes.
2757	On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to try to resolve it.
2757	Attached are: A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last week A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more detailed "backgrounder."

2758	Seem like it's up to Cameron.
2758	In the past, she's said that she doesn't like her B-Day to be included in the weekends' festivities.
2758	I'm happy to celebrate then, though?
2758	And happy to do anything else that anyone wants to do to celebrate.
2758	Signed,
2759	You guys are stars.
2759	Thanks so much for all you did for Prentice.
2759	I think she had a really, really good time and felt really neat about the whole thing.
2759	She's wonderful and you guys gave her the wonderful day that she earned and deserved.
2759	Thanks so much.
2759	And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid yourself with dinner).
2759	OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday night.
2759	If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up and then you two can take my SAAB up.
2759	Then, coming back, you can drive the Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.
2759	What do you think?
2759	Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?
2759	I'm looking for the number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).
2759	Can you find a couple "hauler" numbers in there and send me the numbers?
2759	Thanks a million.
2759	Best, Jeff
2760	Yes, my trunk can handle that easily.
2760	Sounds like a plan!
2760	I'm going to inform folks that I will be off Thursday/Friday.
2760	I'll let you what reaction I get.
2761	chk out today's news.

2762	Power shortage shifts attitudes Posted at 10:51 p.m.
2762	PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001 BY NOAM LEVEY Mercury News Sacramento Bureau California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new poll shows.
2762	Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California.
2762	And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll.
2762	``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey.
2762	``But what is most surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	It is very Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide.
2762	Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and 6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues.
2762	In recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top issue.
2762	And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply, demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a 46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose.
2762	Results dismissed The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as predictable.
2762	``The voters are in a very bad mood.
2762	They are not happy with anyone in this drama,'' South said.
2762	``But these poll numbers need to be taken in context.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	People don't understand what he's done because it is very hard to communicate that in this state.'' South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year.
2762	Davis is expected to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him.
2762	Davis also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004.
2762	The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current electricity crisis.
2762	Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's landmark deregulation five years ago.
2762	``He didn't make the deregulation disaster.
2762	I think that's Pete Wilson's legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose.
2762	Criticism for Davis But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading California out of its power troubles.
2762	Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the governor for not doing more.
2762	Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to control the price that California is being forced to pay for power.
2762	The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected.
2762	But for the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support price caps on electricity.
2762	Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power.
2762	The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the crisis.
2762	But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18 percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8 percent favored federal price controls on generators.
2762	That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of power to mine the California market for excessive profits.
2762	``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association.
2762	Electricity generators argue that price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants.
2762	Backing re-regulation Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will come when Californians' power bills start rising next month.
2762	``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
2762	``But in three weeks, California is going to face a catastrophe.
2762	This is going to hit supernova status.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	.
2762	Once people understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the only solution will be re-regulation.'' Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear, however.
2762	``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California.
2762	``There is less confidence in the state's ability to plan for the long-term future.
2762	And that is giving people worry.
2762	``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and its leaders.'' Mercury News Staff Writer Mike Zapler contributed to this report.
2763	No problem.
2763	Let's talk.
2763	I'm really comfortably having you and me and your mom and keith talk about.
2763	I'm very interested in buying Jay's property, but I don't even the details yet.
2763	Here's my suggestion.
2763	If they want to come up that bad, they should.
2763	My agent is a very cool person up there.
2763	Here name is Sharon Burningham.
2763	She is with Coldwell Banker.
2763	Her number is 707.884.5270.
2763	ext.
2763	308.
2763	You should feel free to tell your mom that Prentice and I have always have the intention of buying Jay's place, and we've had a sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first "head's up" when he decided to sell.
2763	To be honest, we didn't expect it to be this quick, but hey, it is what it is.
2763	You can also tell your mom that I'm very happy to talk about partnering with her.
2763	But it's WAY to early right now.
2763	As we discussed, I need to spend some time with Jay---the other very important thing for me is that Jay's a very good friend, and I want to protect that, too.
2763	In the meantime, I think that it would be great for your mom and Keith to have Sharon take them around and show them some killer million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what the area has to offer.
2763	I'm real happy to call Sharon, too.
2763	That sound like a plan?
2763	Where can I call you?
2763	Best, Jeff
2764	Ditto.
2764	Hope to get to see you in person again soon.
2764	Lay said the CSU meeting went pretty well.
2764	Best, Jeff
2765	Oversight.
2765	No other reason.
2765	Thanks for noticing and letting me know.
2765	Best, Jeff
2766	FYI.
2766	Apologies for the oversight of not including you on the list.
2766	If you have any questions, etc. just give a holler (415.782.7822).
2766	Best, Jeff
2767	Hertzberg called.
2767	We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him.
2767	I've attached the file.
2767	the supporting spreadsheets are not included.
2767	If folks would like them, let me know.
2767	Please keep the file confidential.
2767	Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers.
2767	Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore).
2767	(In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates.
2767	Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon.
2767	In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which will require yet additional increases.
2767	I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail (he would still like to put 100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive market and out from under Loretta).
2767	I will report back after we've spoken.
2767	All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome and appreciated.
2767	Best, Jeff
2768	So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt.
2768	Lodi's a possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic storage assets on the coast.
2768	In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, so there's some uncertainty in the short run.
2768	Bottom line, folks are trying to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very hostile environment.
2768	We should discuss further, though; very interesting idea.
2768	Best, Jeff
2769	I'll have Joseph clean up the letter and send you the email/fax #'s etc. for the list, for the cards that I gathered.
2769	Best, Jeff
2770	The advocacy ad blitz has started.
2770	I don't know if I have the title correct, but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).
2770	The head of the committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we" want to make sure that they're held accountable."
2770	Best, Jeff
2771	plz call as soon as you have a second.
2771	thx, jeff
2772	I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with pro bono financial advice on the crisis.
2772	Hertzberg is still hot on putting all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south of 100% (if this thing gets legs).
2772	Hertzberg asked for, and we provided today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.
2772	It's attached.
2772	Will report back with any further developments.
2772	Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with this one.
2772	That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for both Edison and PG&E.
2772	Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 cents/kwh.
2772	It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's Recent Decision."
2772	Best, Jeff
2773	Here it is.
2774	sigh....
2775	Greetings Hap: Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.
2775	Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up on filings like these in California prior to filing.
2775	As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous forums.
2775	Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.
2775	Want to make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to get this ridiculous state back on track.
2775	Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical.
2775	Thanks much.
2775	Best, Jeff
2776	Congratulations sweetie: Everything OK?
2776	So glad to hear.
2776	All the best to all three of you.
2776	Best, Jeff
2777	Ideally, we'd leave earlier--gotta go to Napa to pick up the Suburban, Annie, etc.---but otherwise, let's try to leave as close to 9 pm as possible.
2777	Best, Jeff
2778	Duly noted.
2778	I'll send you the latest.
2778	I'll include you from this point on in the distribution list.
2778	If it gets to be too much in your in-box, just let me know and I'll try to pare it back.
2778	Here's the bottom line.
2778	Folks have asked me to coordinate California to some degree and there'll be an expectation that we're well coordinated.
2778	Again, this is not at all about making your life more difficult, just a case of being well-informed.
2778	And my apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner.
2778	Best, Jeff
2779	FYI.
2779	We're trying to keep the stuff confidential.
2779	Best, Jeff
2780	Thanks very much for the info Scott.
2780	I'll give Allan a call.

2783	To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and SDG&E to get there. There may be a single tariff for that service, however (rather than taking service off of two tariffs). I'll try to get the tariff numbers and get back to you. All the tariffs are on Sempra's website. Best, Jeff
2784	Here's a map.
2784	Best, Jeff
2785	Good talking to you last nite.
2785	Here's the summary with the 5th scenario.
2785	The Speaker has it.
2785	Give a call if you have any questions.
2785	Best, Jeff
2786	Rick Morrow was very unhappy with it, which in some ways surprised me.
2786	Man, you were loaded for bear!
2786	The points you made came off very compelling.
2786	You enjoying the new role?
2787	do you have eldon's cell phone #?
2788	plz call when you can.
2788	re: core/noncore.
2788	thx, jeff 415.782.7822
2789	Anybody listen in on the press conference?
2789	Anything of note?
2789	Thanks.
2789	Best, Jeff
2790	Thanks a million.
2791	don't have that.
2792	Rosalee: Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr. Lay?
2792	One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our analyis of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been discussing with leaders in California.
2792	The other is a word document explaining the summary tables contents.
2792	If you have any questions, just let me know.
2792	Maureen, can you print out for Steve, too?
2792	Thanks very much for your help.
2792	Best, Jeff
2793	woodward is great!
2793	damned good choice.
2793	who's the 12?
2793	and what day?
2794	Clearly, there are still some really crazy ideas floating around out there.
2795	My apologies, Rosalee.
2795	Not sure what happened.
2795	Let's try again.
2795	Let me know if you're still having problems.
2795	Best, Jeff
2796	Jennifer: I think that Jeff (from Transwestern) should take a look and provide any comments that he might have.
2796	Jeff, feel free to send any comments directly to Jennifer (and copy me, too, since I'm always interested in your comments).
2796	Thanks.
2796	Best, Jeff
2797	That sounds like a fun meeting....
2797	Best of luck.
2797	Best, Jeff
2798	I'm off to a family gathering starting tomorrow (but will be checking in Thursday and Friday).
2798	I'm about 1/3 of the way through reviews.
2798	Any chance of getting a slight delay (say until next Wednesday or Thursday) to complete them?
2798	Best, Jeff
2799	I need to be in Los Angeles at about 10-10:30 am on june 5th.
2799	and we should do the colorado tickets, too, i guess.
2799	i'll call you tomorrow and we can discuss?
2799	thanks for asking.
2799	Best, Jeff
2800	I don't recall Lay saying that the increase should apply to DA customers.
2800	We should discuss further just to make sure that we're all on the same page.
2800	Best, Jeff
2801	I agree.
2802	Seems to have Riordan written all over it.
2802	I say "no big deal."
2802	We're talking to everyone.
2802	No secrecy involved.
2802	We'll keep talking, being constructive and trying to help develop solutions that work for CA.
2802	Your thoughts?
2803	pager (best way to get me) = 888.916.7184
2804	FYI.
2805	Greetings.
2805	Forgive the delays.
2805	The meeting can largely be summarized by the CEC presentation.
2805	I'll have Joseph email it to you.
2805	In a nut shell, there's more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the consumer/business.
2805	The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in California.
2805	The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas infrastructure and do it quickly.
2805	Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry for the delay.
2805	Best, Jeff
2806	I'd blow it off.
2806	Your batting 0.9999999999.
2806	In anybody's book, that's phenomenal.
2806	Don't look back.
2806	And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a stellar job overall.
2806	Vacation was nice.
2806	Thanks.
2806	Bad thing is it made me realize how much more of it I need (and likely ain't gonna get soon).
2806	Best, Jeff
2807	oh come on.
2807	you're kidding, right?
2807	I thought i'd ostracized him from teh enron ranks.
2807	are you sure?
2808	I've got your glasses case with your sunglasses "clip-ons" and a letter to you of some sorts.
2808	May be other stuff, too, but that's all that i've found thus far.
2808	best,
2809	Greetings: Have you seen this?
2809	Any view on whether there's a group of economists who think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to this letter?
2809	P.S.
2809	Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, but I wasn't altogether successful.
2809	Best, Jeff
2810	From Kirsten's second report, sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer legs and moving more quickly.
2810	I'm concerned about Bev speaking on our behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning her to ensure that she has the message down pat.
2810	Thoughts?
2810	Also, I've forewarded the econ letter to Teece to see if we can get the "manifesto" group to respond.
2810	Best, Jeff
2811	just calling them as i see them.
2811	i WISH that i were glad to be back.
2811	but who knows, this core/noncore thing just might work .
2811	please keep all fingers and toes crossed indefinitely.
2811	Best,
2812	Thanks.
2812	Talked to Rob.
2812	He's going to find out timing and cost to do a bigger American Ass.
2812	of Economist number on Wolak & Co., while I work the manifesto gang.
2812	Best, Jeff
2813	The bad news is I left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the Dome.
2813	The good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend!
2813	Thanks again for everything.
2813	Really nice with only the principals---smaller, more intimate, less mess---and the ping pong table is a HUGE hit.
2813	I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.
2813	Best, Jeff
2814	Yeah, tell me about it.
2814	(Payback for what!?!?) So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing?
2814	P.S.
2814	My butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around it......(:
2815	FYI.
2815	For future reference.
2816	You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.
2816	And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).
2816	I'd be happy to talk about it if you want some time.
2816	I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" (the one that comes after teen-age-dom).
2816	So it's less about you and much more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).
2816	I hope I'm not confusing matters more.
2816	Hugs, Jeff
2817	Dear Ms Picky: Thank you and please don't hesitate to comment on such things in the future, because such comments are welcomed and encouraged.
2817	Signed, Grammatically challenged
2818	Thanks, Karen.
2818	Chalk up one for the good guys.
2818	Barrett has been rock-solid (and right) on the issue.
2819	Thanks very much Scott.
2819	Could you also forward to the SF office.
2819	Much appreciated.
2819	Best, Jeff
2820	Status of core/noncore proposal Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing.
2820	Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal."
2820	Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.
2820	Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors) They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats IOU past due) using their MOU numbers.
2820	They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this is pretty consistent with our analysis).
2820	Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me the results tomorrow AM.
2820	Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however.
2820	The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates down).
2820	Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B).
2820	In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't buy 20-year paper.
2820	Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in the event that credit isn't in place by July) Conversation with the Chamber The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and we agreed to stay in close contact. Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn. Best, Jeff
2821	For some reason, the sites not opening.
2821	I'll keep trying and keep you informed.
2821	Best, Jeff
2822	You are most welcome, indeed.
2823	What time's the show?
2823	Do we know what station?
2823	Here are my points: Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric.
2823	If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the investigations have been going on for a year.
2823	Stop the McCarthyist tactics.
2823	Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan More supply Less demand No state takeovers; state out of procurement now.
2823	A real energy market place (competition and choice) Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)
2824	I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his caucus.
2824	Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.
2824	I can make out, however, that it is the core/noncore plan.
2824	I'm attempting to get a better copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.
2824	Please keep confidential that we have a copy.
2824	Thanks.
2824	Best, Jeff
2825	Folks: Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous note.
2825	Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.
2825	It's the copy that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.
2825	Best, Jeff P.S.
2825	Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; Hertzberg has it at about 20%.
2826	u won't believe this (o yes u will).
2826	karen just called and told me that the event's been cancelled.
2826	but don't cancel anything until i get a chance to talk to her live first.
2826	thanks,
2827	Jennifer: To my knowledge, there's been no decision made to date on this issue of exit fees, either at the PUC or the legislature.
2827	But it's my understanding that the rate increases just imposed by the PUC will NOT apply to DA customers.
2827	What happens to customers who switch today, I'm not sure.
2827	Jeanne, any thoughts?
2828	FYI.
2828	I'll be overnighting to you the analysis done for core/noncore by the Gov's finance people.
2828	Best, Jeff
2829	Jennifer: Please be sure to connect Tom and Nancy, since I had a discussion with her about CA gas and had this stuff sent to her.
2829	Best, Jeff
2830	Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers.
2830	The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion back debt through a dedicated charge.
2830	Residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt.
2830	Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created.
2830	"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County).
2830	Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency.
2830	Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt.
2830	The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and "noncore" users.
2830	SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way.
2830	Core users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month.
2830	Noncore would be those using more than 500 kilowatts.
2830	Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers.
2830	But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy.
2830	Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar panels, on contract with the utility.
2830	That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity.
2830	Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to make themselves energy self-sufficient.
2830	The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market.
2830	During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off Edison's debt.
2830	But in 2003, that burden would shift exclusively to the big users.
2830	Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates.
2830	Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells.
2830	Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so.
2830	Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan.
2830	A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks.
2830	"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice president with Edison.
2830	"They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution."
2830	Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity.
2830	"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J.
2830	Smith, a lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association.
2830	"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," Smith said.
2830	Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. They don't want voters to pay because they vote."
2830	CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers.
2830	"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," Rosenfield said.
2830	The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state.
2830	Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion.
2830	Democrats have insisted that for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value.
2830	Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines.
2830	In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset.
2830	In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

2831	Municipal utilities warned Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators.
2831	Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies.
2831	The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 power alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices.
2831	So far this year, the state has paid more than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities.
2831	In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices.
2831	He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance.
2831	"We're going to get that power one way or another," Davis said.
2831	Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies.
2831	In Northern California, there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and Santa Clara.
2831	Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state.
2831	30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities.
2831	He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full details to be made available within 30 days.
2831	Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents, insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations.
2831	The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent.
2831	RUDE AWAKENING While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Davis needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets.
2831	Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis insisted they are required to do by law.
2831	He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as California faces a summer of potential blackouts.
2831	The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed "to make most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market."
2831	Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration.
2831	Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still "trying very hard to promote this notion that we're all in this together."
2831	While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways.
2831	Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes.
2831	Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities Association in Sacramento.
2831	"I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or involuntarily," the governor said.
2831	UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play ball.
2831	To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way.
2831	In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in rolling blackouts during power shortages.
2831	"I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can turn on their lights somewhere else," said Alan Vallow, director of the utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.

2837	To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.
2837	I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes sense.
2837	I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.
2837	Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.
2837	They view it as unfair and punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."
2837	Many questioned Keeley about why the Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.
2837	Keely said that the Assembly is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the Senate (read "Burton").
2837	Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of information used to build the proposal.

2839	FYI.

2839	Might be useful to stress that that under noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of competing providers for their service, not just Enron.
2839	Best, Jeff California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue By Jason Leopold 18:00 ET Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would be on the hook.
2839	In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this week.
2839	The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals.
2839	But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so "desperate" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation.
2839	"The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing out Edison," the aide said.
2839	"We're looking to take the burden off of residential ratepayers."
2839	The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core customers.
2839	Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale market.
2839	The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills.
2839	Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts.
2839	Enron Pushing Access to Customers Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. Burton and Hertzberg said.
2839	An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron.
2839	Enron also has recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the California Chamber of Commerce.
2839	Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with companies like Enron for their power.
2839	Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in place of the utilities.
2839	The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in April.
2839	The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement forward.
2839	State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist."
2839	Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's "core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions.
2839	It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said.
2839	Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity.
2839	"This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said.
2839	"We just got hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states."

2840	I'll forward the piece to Brulte via email and offer to meet with him when I'm in Sacramento on Monday, or have a phone call with him before Monday to discuss the proposal further if he would like.
2840	Best, Jeff
2841	Greetings Senator: I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your message has been forwarded to him.
2841	In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks ago.
2841	It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss solutions to California's electricity crisis. But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have been incurred on their behalf. I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule permits. I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you would like to talk before Monday. If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822. Best, Jeff Dasovich
2842	I think you're dead on.
2843	Not at all.
2843	Should I talk to Jason on background and set him straight?
2844	Municipal utilities lambaste Davis threat to seize power David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, June 1, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: California municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to Gov. Gray Davis' threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices to below-market rates.
2844	"I feel totally betrayed," said George Fraser, general manager of the Northern California Power Agency, an association of 14 municipal utilities.
2844	"It's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business."
2844	This new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the Bay Area, only to cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found.
2844	Davis told The Chronicle in an interview Wednesday that some city-owned municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the out-of- state generators he has accused of gouging California consumers.
2844	He said he was prepared to use his executive authority "to get that power one way or another" if the utilities did not lower their prices.
2844	The state so far has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash- strapped Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.
2844	"What the governor said makes no sense whatsoever," said Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association.
2844	"He was definitely off-base."
2844	Jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to California's electricity market.
2844	However, he said, the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own shortfalls, and thus have a responsibility to their customers -- local city residents -- to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels.
2844	"Our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of California," Jordan said.
2844	"But they aren't going to do that at the expense of customers."
2844	Davis' threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen municipal utilities.
2844	Participants said the tone of the discussion was generally cordial, and it was understood the governor's office would work up a plan for future electricity purchases.
2844	Davis' threat came out of the blue, they said.
2844	"We're willing to sell our excess power," said John Roukema, assistant director of Silicon Valley Power in Santa Clara.
2844	"But we have to deal with the same market conditions that the governor does."
2844	Davis doesn't see it that way.
2844	He believes that many municipal utilities are exploiting California's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits.
2844	The governor's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said in an interview yesterday that Davis' threat to seize the municipals' power was intended as a reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue.
2844	"We want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but doing what they say," Freeman said.
2844	He said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level it cost to generate electricity, plus a reasonable markup of about 15 percent.
2844	Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter.
2844	Before signing on with the Davis administration, he was head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, by far the state's largest municipal utility.
2844	The Los Angeles department has been accused by both federal and state officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity.
2844	Earlier this year, it was asking as much as $1,400 per megawatt hour for its output.
2844	Frank Salas, the department's chief operating officer, said such prices were necessitated by high production expenses.
2844	"We were just recovering our costs," he said.
2844	For his part, Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his watch.
2844	"There was tremendous pressure on me to charge more," he said of urgings from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials for higher profits, demands that Freeman said he had resisted.
2844	"That pressure may have increased now that I'm gone," he said.
2844	"I don't know what they're doing now."
2844	The Department of Water and Power's Salas countered that Freeman should know exactly what his former colleagues were doing.
2844	"We have the same pricing structure now that we had when he was boss," he said.
2844	Fraser at the Northern California Power Agency said it was strange that Davis would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals, which provide only about 15 percent of the state's power needs.
2844	"He's kicking the little guy," he said.
2844	"He's picking on us because he can."

2845	I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 100% of the utilities' past debts).
2845	As folks know, the cost shift provision of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.
2845	The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.
2845	They are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have requested that I be part of those negotiations.
2845	They are not sure that Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.
2845	They will get back to me when they find out.
2845	I'll report back soon as I hear something.
2846	Carolyn Kepplinger (sp?) is calling me---no doubt to talk about core/noncore.
2846	Her number's 202.383.2119.
2846	You want to take it?

2868	sounds good.
2869	Lee: Check the PUC website for information---it sounds like the PUC's inquiry into the adequacy of SoCal's insfrastructure, i.e., in state transportation.
2869	Should be a lot about it on their website (www.cpuc.ca.gov).
2869	If you come up empty, leave me a voicemail (415.782.7822) and I'll track things down.
2869	Best, Jeff

2876	Best, Jeff
2877	In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government (e.g., BPA, Salt River).
2877	Finally, how much did the utilities profit from the high prices (i.e., from selling their excess gen into the PX)?
2877	Best, Jeff
2878	Steve: Please review and edit as needed.

2882	I'm very interested and will try to commit soon.
2882	Best, Jeff "Amy Gustafson Finch" Please respond to afinch
2883	Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the size and other attributes of the customer.
2883	Not aware of any negotiated rates available from the US/Mex border to the burner tip in S.D.
2883	Best, Jeff
2884	Sorry.
2884	Delete previous emails.
2884	This is the final version.
2884	Best, Jeff
2885	we'll likely go to the gym (in Napa) and be back at your place around 7.
2885	That in time for dinner?
2886	I'm assuming that we're not moving to fill the Sacramento position.
2886	If this is correct, let me know and I'll get back to Costigan (who's the Assembly Republican leader's (i.e., David Cox's) Chief of Staff. Best, Jeff
2887	Unless the Commission specifically asked parties to describe how active they intend to be, I don't see any problem with simply stating that we will be a party to the case.
2887	Best, Jeff
2888	Best stick with 10:30 then.
2888	Thanks.
2888	Best, Jeff
2889	email works just fine for the PUC, but it would be good if they followed up with a phone call (no big deal if they don't, but would be helpful).
2889	Best, Jeff
2890	Not a problem.
2890	Best, Jeff
2891	PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.
2891	As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
2891	In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
2891	The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
2891	When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
2891	In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.
2891	The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
2891	The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
2891	Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
2891	The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.
2891	Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
2891	Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
2891	Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.
2891	(My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
2891	All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.
2891	We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.
2891	We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.
2891	Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.
2891	Thanks, Jeff
2892	Glad to hear that there's a meeting set up.
2892	My apologies again.
2892	I'm very wrapped up in trying to help solve California's electricity crisis.
2892	Don't hesitate if there's anything else that I can help out with.
2892	Best, Jeff
2893	Glad to hear it.
2893	Let me know, once you've met, if there's any there there.
2893	Best, Jeff
2894	Coulda sworn I mentioned DB when we had dinner with your guy at Bizou.
2894	Let's talk more to discuss the latest developments.
2894	Glad to hear that it's still moving along.
2894	I'm in town tonite.
2894	You MUST keep this strictly confidential----I've know Colleen for years.
2894	She's a sweet dear friend of mine.
2894	But she's driving me fucking crazy.
2894	I am very happy that you two are buddies and having fun together and that she's being such a big help with your wedding.
2894	But it's going to be best for you and me and Colleen and Scott and Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey and Sammy Soza, and everyone else, if my contact with the wonderful Ms Silva is minimized in the immediate future.
2894	Don't worry about it.
2894	No big deal.
2894	Just want and need you to know.
2894	And please keep it very confidential.
2894	Thanks.
2894	Best, Jeff
2895	Anyone in the market for a $400 hammer?
2895	Alan: I'd like to use the info ( i.e., "we think the contracts are $XX billion out of the money") in the context of the negotiations that I'm in and I'd also like to tell Hertzberg---it will provide a powerful and compelling case to do something about the contracts in order to 1) save the State's rear end and 2) ensure that the core/noncore structure remains alive.
2895	I wouldn't hand out any paper showing any analysis.
2895	How long would it take to refine?
2895	Best, Jeff
2896	Recall that at 4:05 PM on Wednesday, June 27th, we are scheduled to see the Giants clobber the bums.
2897	Please don't use this yet.
2897	Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if marked to market today).
2897	Jim's got it , too.
2897	Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.
2897	Will give you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).
2897	Best, Jeff
2898	Let's do it.
2898	I'll do my darnedest to make it.
2898	Best, Jeff To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Meeting with CERA next week Jeff: As I told you I was planning to do, I have arranged a meeting with CERA nexweek (I will be in town for the infrastructure conference) on Wednesday, Ju27 at 9am in the Enron office.

2900	Missed you lots in Colorado.
2900	You better?
2900	Best, Jeff
2901	Problem is that core has enough through utility retained gen and QF contracts and "noncore" is going to market, so they don't need any of it, which means it's both above market and not needed.
2902	Greetings: This item will be up for discussion in the California negotiations tomorrow beginning at 10 AM.
2902	We're going to have a call to discuss it tomorrow from 9 AM to 9:30 AM PDT.

2903	Best, Jeff
2904	FYI.
2904	Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.
2904	We gave him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.
2904	The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.
2904	We meet again tomorrow at 10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive.
2904	I'll report back with any pertinent info.

2914	Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply.
2914	Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills.
2914	Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past electricity sales.
2914	State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000.
2914	The feuding groups are to meet in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided.
2915	I'll be off on Friday, but will be checking in for messages and will be equipped with pager.

2916	Note PUC decisions that DWR (i.e., the bonds folks) say must occur.

2917	Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Ken Garcia Saturday, June 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out.
2917	This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout, because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite equitably, is suffering his own power crisis.
2917	Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white problem.
2917	How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact?
2917	The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily.
2917	And to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's history.
2917	Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems.
2917	It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist.
2917	Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat of rolling blackouts.
2917	If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics in the dark.
2917	While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers dry.
2917	It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November.
2917	And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State.
2917	But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer.
2917	Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them?
2917	When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain on a certain intern's dress.
2917	The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label "masters of disaster" -- which may be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him.
2917	If only he had considered the accompanying stink.
2917	Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck.
2917	Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of leadership.
2917	So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats, sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents.
2917	The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials, even those who worked in Washington.
2917	And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics - - as required by law.
2917	Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground.
2917	Or as one member of a tax protest group put it: "We are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control."
2917	Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm.
2917	His arrogant treatment of state voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more palatable replacement.
2917	That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election.
2917	And the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas.
2917	Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale.
2917	But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like an urban legend.

2918	If it's no cost to Enron, and if he's good and willing to commute to SF, and if it would be beneficial to the Company, we could certainly use the help and put him to work on interesting things.
2918	But do we we want to infect someone with the lunacy of California regulation and then potentially infect the UK?
2918	Seriously, we can make it work if folks think that it makes sense.

2945	I don't think that we want to give Wood and/or Brown a soap box to stand on by showing our face there.

2946	Best, Jeff Officials criticize energy report Posted at 8:06 p.m.
2946	PDT Thursday, June 28, 2001 Mercury News California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce production and aggravate an already weakening economy, according to researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles.
2946	The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal with the failed deregulation scheme.
2946	The authors of the report released Thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the economic fallout.
2946	``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather the current power crisis without being derailed,'' the report says.
2946	``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow.'' The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office.
2946	Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong.
2946	``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,'' Maviglio said.
2946	``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.'' Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting professor at UCLA, collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from the Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
2946	The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy crisis.
2946	In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 percent in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002.
2946	The report predicts consumers can expect 112 hours of rolling blackouts this year.
2946	However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the wholesale costs.
2946	This could reduce blackouts to 12 hours, lower the debt and interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment in the state to increase energy supplies.
2946	But Peter Navarro, a management professor at the University of California-Irvine, was skeptical of the report's findings.
2946	He said it was almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the factors that affect energy prices in the state.
2946	In addition, he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation of the current market, which Navarro argues could be distorting prices as well.
2946	``How do you justify raising retail rates to 45 cents for power that costs a nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed?'' Navarro said.
2946	``This report seems to have an industry point of view and an industry agenda.''

2948	best, Jeff
2949	Let's discuss further.
2949	I've been in close contact with Chris on this.
2949	I'm not sure that we necessarily need a "presentation" on the issue.
2949	Speaking only for California, policy makers and industry participants know a) that there's a problem and b) that the magnitude of the problem is significant, and there's not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that front.
2949	I would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally, and spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation for external consumption.
2949	As everyone's aware, this issue is a very complicated one and sensitive one for Enron and we need to be very careful w.r.t.
2949	how we approach it.
2949	Thoughts?
2949	Best, Jeff

2975	Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.
2975	I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
2975	The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.
2975	I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.
2975	I would appreciate your feedback.
2975	The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.
2975	In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.
2975	Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.
2975	Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.
2975	For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.
2975	I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.
2975	Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now.
2975	And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.
2975	Your thoughts are appreciated.
2975	In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.
2975	With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.
2975	Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.
2975	If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.
2975	And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?
2975	Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.
2975	Best, Jeff

2982	FYI.
2982	From today's Post.
2982	Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.
2982	Best, Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
2982	Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis.
2982	"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday.
2982	"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."
2982	The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations.
2982	Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise.
2982	"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters.
2982	"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."
2982	The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday.
2982	Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy.
2982	Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
2982	Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
2982	Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media.
2982	Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks.
2982	But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said.
2982	The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said.
2982	Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners.
2982	FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
2982	Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals.
2982	California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices.
2982	When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills.
2982	In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers.
2982	The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years.
2982	That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say.
2982	A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund.
2982	Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
2982	Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.
2982	"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
2982	The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
2982	"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid.
2982	Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.
2983	gee, tough break.

2987	USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.
2987	Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
2987	(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.
2987	Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement.
2987	As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors.
2987	Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said.
2987	The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts.
2987	Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour.
2987	The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities.
2987	These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities.
2987	"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

2991	California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail.
2991	The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.
2991	It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said.
2991	Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts.
2991	This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27.
2991	The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt.
2991	``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail.
2991	``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.
2991	According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday.
2991	One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour.
2991	Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour.
2991	Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate.
2991	Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service.
2991	California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail.
2991	Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market.
2991	The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season.
2991	Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.
2992	gee, tough break.

2996	Technical Working Group Folks- Ok, here is the plan.
2996	We need to draft language on the following issues (including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in our Roadmap Document: Direct Access Large Customer Utility Service options Rate Relief Customer Specific Generation Renewable Energy These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.
2996	I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a work product?
2996	If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know.

3001	Here is a stab at draft legislative language for the core/noncore portion (i.e., section 1) of the agreeement.
3001	See you later today.
3001	Best, Jeff
3002	Below is an update from the weekend's activities.
3002	The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.
3002	The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today.
3002	He will distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
3002	The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
3002	As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
3002	The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
3002	Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
3002	In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
3002	Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.
3002	Best, Jeff
3003	Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.

3006	To: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, JameYoder/ENRON@enronXgate, Bill Williams III/ENRON@enronXgate, Tim cc: Subject: Transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the ISO Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-timetrader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP")for replacement energy.
3006	The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excesenergy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).
3006	There are two phone calls.
3006	The first call is the ISO calling to ask us tohelp it to set the price.
3006	The next call occurs three minutes later and isthe ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.
3006	Our trader told the ISOthat he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything wrong."
3006	Note: I have just learned a complicating detail: Coincidentally, our deskdid put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.
3006	However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called ourdesk.
3006	Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO,s Real Time DeEnron: Enron, this is David [Porter].
3006	ISO: Hi David.
3006	This is Allen at the ISO.

3006	ISO: Allen: Yeah.
3006	Enron: Ryan: This is Ryan [Slinger].
3006	ISO: Allen: Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.
3006	Did you guysput a trade in, replacement [energy]?
3006	Not trade, but a bid?
3006	Enron: Ryan: For which hour, for hour 15?
3006	ISO: Allen: For hour 16?
3006	Enron: Ryan: For hour 16, correct.
3006	ISO: Allen: Can you guys continue to put the price at that?
3006	Enron: Ryan: At what?
3006	At $91.86?
3006	ISO: Allen: Yes Enron: Ryan: Um,(. ISO: Allen: This isn,t on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing. It would be good to keep it [theMarket Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price. It doesnmatter how many megawatts you put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price. Enron: Ryan: Wait, you said we,re not on a recorded line, or we are? ISO: Allen: We,re not. No, we,re not, okay. We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and wewanted you, if it,s possible, to continue to set that, whether it,s 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there. Enron: Ryan: Okay, um(.. ISO: Allen: We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market. Enron: Ryan: Oh yeah. Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn,t it? ISO: Allen: Not replacement. Enron: Ryan: Oh, not replacement? ISO: Allen: No. What happened is that we bought it back(.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties. They were faking it. So we wanted to keep the price uphigh. Allen and Ryan: Unintelligible. Enron: Ryan: So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying itISO: Allen: Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, thebasically they are trying to buy it back at a penny. Enron: Ryan: Oh, that,s ridiculous. ISO: Allen: That,s really ticking us off and right now . . . Enron: Ryan: That to me signals, that,s probably Powerex, isn,t it? ISO: Allen: There,s about four of them right now. Enron: Ryan: Shit. ISO: Allen: And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn,t, we didn,t, we took them out. Basically, we,re not allowing anything over the ties. Enron: Ryan: I didn,t submit one for 17 or (. ISO: Allen: That,s fine. They,ll probably go to a penny and theyprobably get excited and do a bunch, and we,ll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91. Enron: Ryan: Okay. All right. Well, I,ll see what I can do. ISO: Allen: I appreciate it. It,s actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it. Enron: Ryan: Okay. ISO: Allen. Thanks, bye. Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO,s Real Time Delater) Enron: This is Ryan. ISO: Hey Ryan, its Allen. Enron: Ryan: Yeah. ISO: Allen: Hey, did you put it in for the next hour? Enron: Ryan: For hour 16? ISO: Allen: Yeah, no, they already ran 17. Enron: Ryan: Oh, I didn,t do 17, no. ISO: Allen: Well, see, we,re gonna run, we,re gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes. Enron: Ryan: Okay. ISO: Allen: If you have any questions, let me know. I hope you know thisis me from the ISO. I don,t know if you think I,m somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.

3013	Best, Jeff
3014	Folks: Here are my edits.
3014	For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.
3014	They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.
3014	Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."
3014	Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.
3014	In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.
3014	I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.
3014	In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.
3014	Please take a look at the language.
3014	While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.
3014	I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.
3014	In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"
3014	There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.
3014	Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.
3014	I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.
3014	Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

3019	The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts.
3019	But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.
3019	The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary.
3019	The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.
3019	The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
3019	Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
3019	No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."
3019	The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
3019	The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

3022	Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments: Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads: This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service.
3022	I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."
3022	If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in. But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.
3022	As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.
3022	There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.
3022	It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
3022	Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.
3022	We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.

3040	Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that: "Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. " Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.
3040	Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.
3040	Best, Jeff
3041	yep.

3052	Worse, there was no attachment in Rick's note.
3052	Could you forward to me the final.
3052	Thanks a gazillon.
3052	Best, Jeff
3053	You're fired.
3054	FYI.
3054	Please keep confidential until further notice.
3054	Important to note that this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the specific language.
3054	It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the Legislature as soon as possible.
3054	In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue requirement" next week.
3054	I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.
3054	It's going to get very interesting from here.
3054	Best, Jeff
3055	Great first cut.
3055	Thanks very much.

3059	LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones By Jason Leopold LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country, raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a - about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.
3059	That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.
3059	On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan. 18 through May 31 this year.
3059	That price is about $35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers.
3059	Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became Davis' top energy adviser.
3059	Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's two largest utilities.
3059	"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face, because they are robbing us blind," he said.
3059	"The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators."
3059	Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.
3059	The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return calls for comment.
3059	Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.
3059	Power To Sell According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling power to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.
3059	The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed in throughout 2000.
3059	The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as much as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging.
3059	The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt and will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.
3059	"It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in an interview last year.
3059	Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."
3059	According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as $20 million.
3059	Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility.
3059	On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high.
3059	The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001.
3059	On Monday, settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.
3059	Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

3070	Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues (Published July 11, 2001) California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit: The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of dollars to cover the debt.
3070	There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners demand more juice than California can generate or buy.
3070	One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of joining it.
3070	There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin, media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming dominant, while the real situation fades into the background.
3070	This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality and everything to do with the virtual version.
3070	Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and ripped off."
3070	But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended for a refund proceeding.
3070	And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic, Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity.
3070	"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed.
3070	But that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due.
3070	"If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see you in court," Davis said Tuesday.
3070	Why is Davis being so belligerent?
3070	Because it's good politics.
3070	Ever since he began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing.
3070	If he settled for substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be embarrassed.
3070	Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators.
3070	That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year -- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do it.
3070	Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan George W. Bush is a co-conspirator.
3070	But the power purchase records -- which were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
3070	The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic virtual world.
3070	One cannot, however, ignore reality forever.
3070	The likelihood of a pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy court.
3070	The Legislature has refused to act on the Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's debts would be slimmed down by FERC.
3070	This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the utility into bankruptcy court later this summer.
3070	That's part of that nasty old reality that cannot simply be wished away.

3086	FYI.
3086	You may have read that Calpine is close to reaching a deal with the state on its overcharges (about $240MM).
3086	Note from structuring's analysis that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.
3086	That is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts account for about $4.4B So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets $4.4 B. Nice work if you can get it.
3087	Thanks.Glad to hear it.
3088	Sue and I discussed, and if it ain't too much trouble, I think the search should go from 1996-1998 and should include any letters to FERC from any legislator (but Peace in particular) and any PUC commissioner (i.e., Fessler).

3093	This is it.
3093	Really appreciate it.

3094	sorry, thought it had been forwarded this to you previously.
3094	best,
3095	Please forward to others who need this information.
3095	As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.
3095	Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.
3095	The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.
3095	The URL for the bill is attached.
3095	Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are: Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book.
3095	Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above.
3095	Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.
3095	Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility.
3095	Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
3095	Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts.
3095	AB82XX does not address this issue.
3095	Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."
3095	Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week.
3095	The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday.
3095	The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working Will continue to provide updates as events unfold.
3095	If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.
3095	If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

3098	California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1) By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf of the state's utilities.
3098	The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7 billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of the state's Public Utilities Commission.
3098	Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the agency, said no rate increase is expected.
3098	``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said.
3098	``In fact our numbers show that there is no need for any increase beyond what's already been done.'' The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said.
3098	The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra Energy.
3098	The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled to begin in September.
3098	Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases.
3098	His position hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today.
3098	Previous Increases In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the state's two largest utilities.
3098	Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at the time.
3098	The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said.
3098	The increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power purchases.
3098	The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent.
3098	California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by spreading power costs over time.
3098	The debt will be repaid over 15 years.
3098	Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt.
3098	Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment.
3098	That pledge, typical for revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an added cushion.
3098	That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the legislation.
3098	Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of the bond sale.
3099	Barry, et al: FYI.
3099	Some initial info I got from our outside council regarding utility authority to engage in financial risk management tools.
3099	More info to follow as we get it.
3099	If you have quesitons, comments, or suggestions for additional research needed, just holler.
3099	Please forward to others who might need it.
3099	Best, Jeff Electric: SCE, PG&E and SDG&E are all authorized to enter into bilateral forward transactions with non-ISO or PX parties.
3099	D.00-08-023 and D.00-09-075.
3099	These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire on or before 12-31-05.
3099	Initial contracts are subject to a blanket reasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of portfolio=deemed reasonable) but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject to a CPUC preapproval process.
3099	Gas: PG&E authorized to use gas hedges for all purposes (D.98-12-082) but limited to contracts expiring on or beforce 12-31-02 and limited to $200 million in cost or 800 MMcfd in volume.
3099	We are looking for a similar resolution or decision for Sempra.
3099	Haven't found it yet, but we believe they have been given similar authority.
3100	Here's the latest that we have on the legislation ("82XX") released on Friday.
3100	The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an "informational" hearing on 82XX at 1:30 PM PDT today.
3100	"Informational" means that there won't be a vote today.
3100	Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an "author" of 82XX), Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
3100	The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
3100	Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with the "more recent version" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other authors had agreed to final language from their perspective.
3100	Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out tomorrow.
3100	PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the Commission gives up all review of DWR's "revenue requirement" and simply flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree).
3100	As a result, details of any "rate agreement" between DWR and the CPUC, and any public announcement by DWR of its "revenue requirement" is could be postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta.
3100	The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.
3100	(They cite lower gas prices and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, though many remain very skeptical.) However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate would be sufficient, according to the same consultants.
3100	The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.
3100	The bill would then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
3100	It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
3100	In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version of an Edison "MOU," and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the Senate side appears strained.
3100	The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
3100	Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.
3100	Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.
3100	If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to contact me by pager @ 888.916.7184.

3103	Any information on the list of parties who have indicated that they will cross Steve and for how long, and any testimony filed by those parties.
3103	In addition, I would recommend strongly that Dan and Steve (at a minimum) get on the phone and discuss Steve's testimony tomorrow, and plan to meet prior to the hearing on Wednesday.
3103	If you'd like me to participate in a call tomorrow, just let me know.
3103	If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
3103	Best, Jeff
3104	Hi Wanda/Michael.
3104	You aware of this?
3104	I don't recall having received anything from PG&E.
3104	Best, Jeff
3105	Great.
3105	Thanks very much, Wanda.
3105	Best, Jeff
3106	Thanks so much.
3106	What's the RT fare for SF/Denver?
3106	Best, Jeff
3107	thank you much.
3107	Best, Jeff
3108	Jim, I think that the point of the "flurry" is that we in California ain't received anything from PG&E.
3108	Seemed that Wanda, from her note, said that she is on top of it.
3108	Can you check in with Tamara and find out what her issues are?
3108	Greatly appreciated.
3108	(From what I heard on the phone last night, sounds like that little girl of yours is going to be an opera singer.) Best, Jeff
3109	Mike, Please make sure that Paul and Sue and I get on these notes.
3109	Thanks a bunch.
3109	Best, Jeff
3110	FYI.
3110	This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).
3110	Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would "impair" the contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western Civilization as we know it).
3110	The Senate ain't buying that line.
3110	As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.
3110	We urging Brulte to go along, but only in exchange for deleting the "no DA" language in AB1X and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.
3110	Best, Jeff Please respond to sgovenar
3111	I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
3111	Few questions.
3111	Mike, I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar.
3111	Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill?
3111	What about the generators?
3111	Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)?
3111	What about large customers?
3111	They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it.
3111	Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill?
3111	I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem.
3111	There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state.
3111	If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state?
3111	Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.
3111	Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.
3111	Thanks again for the heads up.
3111	Best, Jeff
3112	Thanks very much.
3112	I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist for Wild Goose on this one?
3112	Can you please let me know 1) the outcome of the meeting and 2) any actions the group intends to take.
3112	I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.
3112	Give me a call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.
3112	Finally, what information do you have about where generators and other large customers groups (i.e., CMTA, the Chamber and CLECA) are on the bill?
3112	Best, Jeff
3113	I want to find out what the group comes up with this afternoon, and find out where CMA, the Chamber, CLECA and the generators are first.
3113	You know where they are?
3113	Best, Jeff
3114	FYI.
3115	thx for email.
3115	likely that kirby/dunn will sign deal today?
3115	best, jeff
3116	Thanks.
3116	Call me on my cell, or page me after you meeting this afternoon and let's discuss.
3116	Best, Jeff
3117	Sounds good.
3117	You can reach me at 415.782.7822.
3117	Because my schedule is a mess (thanks to the mess California has created), if you don't reach me on my office line, please try 415.505.6633.
3117	Also, I think that it would be very useful to have Leslie Lawner on, since she's involved a lot in California gas matters, but it's your call.
3117	Just let me know.
3117	Best, Jeff
3118	FYI.
3118	Unclear exactly whose bill this is.
3118	Trying to get a handle on it.
3118	Sue's got a hunch that her buddy Herr Peace is behind it.
3118	Best, Jeff
3119	FYI.
3119	Best, Jeff
3120	did i mention that rental fees to use the truck are $67/day?
3120	that aside, our net account is now: Nancy owes Jeff for Abalone ($67/entree) = $149,756.39 Jeff owes Nancy for parking fees ($67/day) = $189.00 Nancy owes Jeff $149,567.39 Also, thanks a million for the delicious dinner, the very competitive game of spades, letting me do my laundry, and compelling conversation about watery/non-watery tomatoes.

3121	USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
3121	Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
3121	NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
3121	The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. , EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.
3121	The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper.
3121	"I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said.
3121	With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.
3121	Most energy trading platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits.
3121	Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day.
3121	But while ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline one can only trade with Enron.
3121	"It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said.
3121	Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States.
3121	About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic platform.
3121	"As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue to grow," Piper said.
3121	The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals, steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics.
3121	"We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get more traction," Piper said.
3121	"There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't even tapped into yet."
3121	Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success.
3121	The Atlanta-based exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its trade volumes.
3121	"Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Piper said.
3121	"But right now, there is room for the both of us."
3121	He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE.
3121	Many of the energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also Enron's biggest clients.
3121	"Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one," Piper said.
3121	INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States, Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of ways to become more successful.
3121	"The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline," Piper said.
3121	"But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional about it."
3121	One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different markets and regions.
3121	It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal.
3121	But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many exchange.
3121	"We want to focus in providing our markets to others," he said.
3121	"In the near term, we're not changing that."
3121	The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it.
3121	EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats off.
3121	"I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong," said Frank Getman, chief executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet.
3121	"If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the market, then people will continue to use your site."
3121	Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

3122	Dear John: You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset.
3122	Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last week.
3122	To wit: according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the alleged "overcharges."
3122	John, combined, the government sellers, including CA munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, "overcharged" California by a factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have "overcharged."
3122	(See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.) So notes like this, are ill-informed.
3122	I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and LADWP.
3122	Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, "well, it's not the gouging. that's not the problem. it's the "profit motive" we've set up that's the problem."
3122	so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't control.
3122	everyone else is blood-sucking scum.
3122	(in addition, please inform Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to others. it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR contract problem.) Sorry for the flame, but it's gotten extremely tiresome, and it ain't personal; but the emperor has no clothes, which will increasingly become increasingly apparent.
3122	all that aside, we've got other work that's more important, and i look forward to continue working on it.
3122	best,
3123	I owe ya.
3124	I think that you'll be fine for what you need it for on Thursday with the camper shell on .
3124	Trust me.
3125	FYI.
3125	New amendments out on DA that Keeley's accepted that I'm faxing to you right now.
3125	Also, it's 82XX we're talking about, not 83XX.
3125	83XX is the bill that Wright's authoring with the Rs.
3125	Also faxing to you Reliant's "Dear Dunn, Go to Hell, Sincerely, Reliant" letter.
3125	Best, Jeff Vegas still sez best odds are on Edison going in.
3126	Greetings Jeff: Hope all is well.
3126	I hear that my cameo in the video upstaged the pie....
3126	If there's anything I can do to assist on the request from Chambers, just let me know.
3126	All the best, Jeff
3127	Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B By Mark Golden NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion whan adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge wastaken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.
3127	The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and itsestimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by thejudge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliersand the state over potential refunds last week.
3127	Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, thestate is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been callearbitrary by critics.
3127	The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.
3127	FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for notnegotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refunddue may amount to about $1 billion.
3127	Power suppliers offered just over $700million.
3127	Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refunand has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.
3127	The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go throughthe ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources.
3127	Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases, the ISO made estimates.
3127	"We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said.
3127	"The refunamount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."Resetting The Baseline Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through theISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law for California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in additionto sales to the California Department of Water Resources.
3127	The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, newsmsgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January.
3127	DWR hasalso been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated faprices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - byretroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19.
3127	Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generatorneeded to meet demand each hour.
3127	But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagnerecommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula bemodified when used retroactively to determine refunds.
3127	Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mufurther.
3127	For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averagof natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state.
3127	Wagner recommended using power producers' actual gas costs.
3127	Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices woucut potential refunds sharply.
3127	Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by aboutone-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.
3127	ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.
3127	"The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said.
3127	"We just maintain that position."
3127	FERC Baseline Questioned In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that whenfair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the priccap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to havebeen available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand.
3127	That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.
3127	Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.
3127	One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandtsaid, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units.
3127	Consideringonly the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent therewards for such withholding, he said.
3127	"The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit uswould have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect," Hildebrandt said in an interview.
3127	In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference betweenactual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and foevery hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect.
3127	The ISO released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained hisnumbers aren't justified.
3127	"These are based on very tangible records," he said.
3127	"The idea that it's ablack box is misleading."

3128	Greetings.
3128	Hope all is well.
3128	Trade you energy for broadband.
3128	Whaddya say?
3128	Best, Jeff
3129	Have you looked at the places in 82XX that Scott FedEx-ed to you that implicate the "PX credit?"
3129	I've gotta assume that Edison put it in, and I frankly, ain't had the chance to peek at it.
3129	For that reason, I'm worried.
3129	Can you page me and let me know your take?
3129	Best, Jeff
3130	Not going to D.C. after all.
3130	Now the bad news: that means I'll likely have to come back to Sacramento, instead.
3131	Love to catch up.
3131	When you get a minute tomorrow page me (I'm mobile this week) and we can talk.
3131	888.916.7184.
3131	Best, Jeff
3132	Have you seen this?
3133	Looks like Loretta's attempt to peel off the DWR contracts from the bonds at the PUC, which the Legislature has been contemplating but hasn't done anything about.
3133	Best, Jeff
3134	John: I could be wrong about what I think Loretta's doing so make sure that somebody verifies before you pass on what I've said.
3134	Could be totally wrong; but hope I'm right.
3134	Best, Jeff
3135	The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.
3135	In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
3135	Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
3135	The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full.
3135	Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access.
3135	There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.
3135	In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
3135	That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
3135	We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later.
3135	The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.
3135	The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
3135	The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.
3135	The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.
3135	That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.
3135	But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.
3135	In short, little has changed since yesterday.
3135	Best, Jeff
3136	talked to pat.
3136	he wants me to talk by phone rather than come to DC.
3136	happy to go if necessary.

3138	understand.
3138	trying to change.
3138	chk email for leg update.
3138	best, jeff
3139	thanks, babe.
3140	FYI.
3140	How would you like to handle?
3140	Best, Jeff
3141	The wierdness continues.....
3141	In the Senate: After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was "all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
3141	The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same committee.
3141	In the Assembly: Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched his vote and let it get out.
3141	82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
3141	83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today.
3141	Will report back later this AM with any additional information.
3141	Best, Jeff
3142	aye aye.
3143	wow, that's blasephemous, dude.
3143	hey, is there any chance that you might be able to pick up some instruments at Peacock today?
3143	I was going to do it, but now have to go so fucking Sacramento.
3143	need to get the cameron's guitar so you guys can take with you to Colorahdee.
3144	where can i call you?
3144	needed to get cameron's guitar fixed so i can use it during the competition in colorado.
3144	had to get it fixed at peacock, but need to pick up today (and prentice's) banjo, which is getting fixed.
3144	where can i call you?
3145	Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.
3145	Other info from the conversation: With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as they go."
3145	Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass.
3146	chk email re: Dunn info from Hedy.
3146	Jeff
3147	As best I can figure, Reliant's included.
3147	Best, Jeff
3148	How's 8 AM PDT, 11 AM EDT?
3148	Could you summarize for me precisely what she'd like to discuss?
3148	Thanks.
3148	Best, Jeff
3149	Scott: Can you try to find me bios of these folks?
3149	Thanks very much.
3149	Jeff
3150	Could not have happened to a nicer or more deserving bunch.
3150	Congratulations and all the best.
3150	Best, Jeff
3151	Yes, 11 PDT works for me.
3151	Understand what you need.
3151	Will do best to deliver.
3151	Best, Jeff
3152	John: Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.
3152	The language does two things: 1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers.
3152	2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond payments, etc.) We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on SB 18?
3152	Lemme know.
3152	Best, Jeff
3153	Correction: 1) ensures that DA customers' costs are NOT shifted to utility customers.
3154	The Republicans are currently on the Senate floor arguing (noisily, repeatedly and passionately) that California (and the Senate in particular) is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and investigating private companies and ignoring munis.
3154	One Senator specifically identified prices charged by LADWP and SMUD and compared those prices to Enron's (1/3 to 1/2 less than LADWP and SMUD charged).
3154	Best, Jeff
3155	In the Senate: Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the bill out of the full Senate sometime today.
3155	The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR.
3155	The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the "Edison MOU" (SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a vote by the full Senate.
3155	It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR contracts) prior to leaving for vacation.
3155	Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take depositions of individuals.
3155	In the Assembly: The Assembly has thus far failed to get an "MOU" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) will get voted out of the Assembly today.
3156	man, you ain't kiddin'.
3157	Will do.
3157	Sue Mara, my colleague in the SF office, will join the call.
3157	Tom, what's your number?
3157	Best, Jeff
3158	Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum.
3158	In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
3158	The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
3158	The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing.
3158	In the Senate: SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.
3158	The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of DWR contracts.
3158	The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the DWR contracts.
3158	The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or end, Direct Access.
3158	Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to substantial damages.
3158	As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, its chances of passage there are low.
3158	The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50.
3158	The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and leadership is awesome.
3158	In the Assembly: The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX) The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
3158	The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82XX).
3158	Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly Republicans.
3158	In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
3158	Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed.
3158	As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.
3159	Dude: Thanks a million for getting the instruments.
3159	Sorry to burden with the chore.
3159	See you in Cah-lo-rah-dee.
3159	Best, Jeff
3160	Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy Former governor defends himself Carla Marinucci, Chronicle Political Writer Friday, July 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis.
3160	"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday.
3160	Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to blur perception of the current energy troubles.
3160	"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a triumph -- for Davis."
3160	But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power."
3160	Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis -- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as the state's most pressing problem.
3160	Many of those voters blame Wilson, not Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows.
3160	The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history."
3160	"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday.
3160	"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his mess."
3160	The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White House's energy policy.
3160	But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of California's problems.
3160	"They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in California, Bush told reporters Wednesday.
3160	"And guess what? When you grow your state the way they have . . . it creates problems."
3160	Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration.
3160	In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to seek state approval for new plants.
3160	While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I thought the flaws would be addressed."
3160	"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the legislation.
3160	"(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while."
3160	But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's energy woes -- had benefits for the state.
3160	Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians."
3160	Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 1970s -- to build large power plants.
3160	Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions made before he took office, Wilson noted.
3160	"I hope that he's pleased with our handiwork."
3160	Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the California Energy Commission about coming blackouts.
3160	And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a crisis: emergency powers.
3160	Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses.
3160	He used his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the bridges within 65 days.
3160	South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- blown statewide energy crisis.

3161	Good plan.

3165	Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled By Jennifer Coleman Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison.
3165	The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year.
3165	"I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles.
3165	Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly.
3165	The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure.
3165	The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy.
3165	Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices.
3165	Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid.
3165	That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it "neither needs nor deserves. "I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim.
3165	They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers.
3165	Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation."
3165	During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. "It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. "I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."
3165	The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to "iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. "I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said. On the Net: Read the bills, AB82xx by Keeley and SB78xx by Polanco, at Read the governor's Memorandum of Understanding at
3166	Summary of the activities since Friday: Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison MOU."
3166	Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.
3166	In the Senate: The "Edison MOU": As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
3166	The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
3166	The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.
3166	Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective.
3166	The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
3166	Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
3166	Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
3166	Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.
3166	The "Dunn Investigation": Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
3166	The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
3166	Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
3166	In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
3166	She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.
3166	The budget: The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
3166	The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
3166	That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.
3166	The Assembly In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.
3166	The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
3166	Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened.
3166	It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
3166	The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
3166	Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
3166	Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
3166	Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

3172	NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE Looks Like a Recession Economy on the edge Sunday, July 22, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: California, the world's fifth largest economy, the global capital of technology and entertainment, is teetering on the brink of a serious recession.
3172	Unemployment is rising, job creation is falling and respected forecasters are painting a bleak future for the state.
3172	California is not alone.
3172	Nationally, the employment picture is also troubling.
3172	Income is flat.
3172	Industrial production has been shrinking for nine months.
3172	Only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going.
3172	The key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending, so important for California.
3172	Once the engine of productivity growth, and the source of rising standards of living, the double-digit pace of those spending increases slowed dramatically, beginning in the second half of last year.
3172	Since then, Silicon Valley companies have experienced sales declines of 5 to 10 percent, not calamitous drops, but compared to the 40 percent growth they had been used to, an enormous gap.
3172	Hence these companies have been cutting back on everything from production to personnel to facilities.
3172	The "new economy," it turns out, is not immune to the basic laws of economics.
3172	Nationally, the most respected "blue chip" private forecasters believe we will avoid a recession.
3172	They see the economy growing just over 1 percent this year and by 2 to 3 percent next year.
3172	Having been more optimistic for some years, I became more pessimistic last year, and remain so despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and the Bush administration's tax refunds.
3172	Whether we skirt the technical definition of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- will be a close call.
3172	We should see a modest recovery late this year, and a pick-up of steam in 2002.
3172	The California economy is in for a rougher time, at least in the short term.
3172	And this time -- unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California bore the brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry -- the Bay Area will be hit much harder.
3172	While the region grew much faster than the rest of the state in the '90s, most of the symbols of that growth -- full employment, exploding property values, shrinking commercial vacancy rates -- are already history.
3172	Workers who just a short time ago were getting BMWs as a signing bonus are now being laid off.
3172	Statewide unemployment -- 5.1 percent last month -- is likely to increase another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and aerospace.
3172	Still -- and here's some good news -- Bay Area unemployment, even in Santa Clara County, which took a major hit in June, is still below the statewide rate.
3172	In per capita income, the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide, 75 percent above the national average.
3172	What of the longer term?
3172	California faces serious problems, not the least of which is the energy mess, which has exacerbated the current slowdown.
3172	Our recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country.
3172	But the long-term picture is brighter.
3172	Information technologies have brought about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every major industry in the so-called "old economy."
3172	Such enhancements will themselves result in renewed information technology spending, if not at the frenetic pace of the late 1990s.
3172	The main concern is whether California will degenerate into an even more anti-business climate.
3172	We are already viewed by the business community as an overtaxed, over-regulated state.
3172	Gov. Gray Davis' rhetoric, and some of his actions, during the energy debacle have only added to the impression.
3172	While Davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy conservation, his demagogic attacks on "outside" energy companies, and the suggestion that California should go it alone, are not only poor policy solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part.
3172	His plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars.
3172	Do we believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely, efficiently and devoid of politics?
3172	California would be better off if the governor got out of the energy business.
3172	The state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the energy situation.
3172	The initial refusal by Davis' appointees on the Public Utilities Commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened the shortages and sharpened the price spikes.
3172	Then, at the peak of the market frenzy, the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the state into paying unnecessarily high prices.
3172	And by keeping prices to consumers unrealistically controlled, he has passed the burden for energy costs on to the taxpayers -- current and future.
3172	With all the problems and missteps, however, there is great reason to be optimistic about California's economic future.
3172	We are still a beacon of opportunity.
3172	We still attract the best and the brightest.
3172	We are still the best incubator of new ideas and businesses.
3172	However, our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for granted.
3172	With better state policy -- lower tax rates, less regulation, reforms to improve our schools, and a more efficient energy and transportation infrastructure -- California will reemerge as the leader of a strong national economy, providing opportunity, mobility and still higher standards of living.
3172	Michael J. Boskin was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors from 1989 to 1993.
3172	He is now a senior fellow at teh Hoover Institution and the the Tully.
3172	M. Friedman Professor of Economics at Stanford.
3173	Quick add on to Sue's note: Right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy.
3173	There appears to continue to be considerable uncertainty----seems that even many Democratic Assembly members don't know at this point what the plan is for this afternoon/evening.
3173	Our lobbyists are attempting to get more info, which we'll pass on soon as we get it.

3185	Quick update to Jim's note: Still appears that the Assembly only has enough left in it tonite to deal with the budget and then recess; and it is still unclear if they'll get enough Republicans to go along tonite, or be forced to come back tomorrow to try again.
3185	If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap.
3185	(The Legislature is scheduled to be out until August 20th.) The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement with DWR, DWR's rev.
3185	req.
3185	and other issues on August 23rd.
3185	PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August.
3185	As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the PUC.
3185	Best, Jeff
3186	The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
3186	The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
3186	There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal.
3186	For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
3186	The activity now moves to the PUC.

3193	Best, Jeff Figures show state lost big on extra power Posted at 9:53 p.m.
3193	PDT Monday, July 23, 2001 BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.
3193	The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss.
3193	But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts -- and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be needed.
3193	A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers.
3193	``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who requested details of the state's surplus power sales.
3193	``The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less.
3193	``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources.
3193	Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher.
3193	The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month.
3193	State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left California holding more power than it needs.
3193	The revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer.
3193	Price that was paid The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry.
3193	The state has sold 178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the department said.
3193	Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost.
3193	A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour as well as cheaper spot-market buys.
3193	State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1.
3193	Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's July purchases, which totaled $415 million.
3193	The $6.5 million from sales will help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity.
3193	``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations,'' Hidalgo said.
3193	``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal operating procedure for any utility.'' Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a cost of doing business.
3193	The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging ``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy.
3193	Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find.
3193	``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said.
3193	Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable.
3193	State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million this month, in part because the state has so much power.

3194	Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for years (Published July 24, 2001) The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn over internal documents.
3194	Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high.
3194	And it has become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
3194	At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay.
3194	"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said.
3194	With less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor suppliers to California.
3194	Some of it is just buzzword politics.
3194	Lockyer and Davis know that Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of President Bush's major political supporters.
3194	Enron, meanwhile, cites the rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats.
3194	Enron also filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading data.
3194	Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana.
3194	But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."
3194	Does Enron have something to hide?
3194	Or does it sincerely believe that what's happening in California is political scapegoating?
3194	Are the companies' fears about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified?
3194	Would data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light?
3194	Would data be used by competitors?
3194	Or could the information find its way into the hands of class-action attorneys?
3194	Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative purposes.
3194	But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of turning over confidential information to politicians.
3194	Similar information was leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
3194	And there are indications that private lawyers are working closely with investigators.
3194	Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings, that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices.
3194	Duke then refuted the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.
3194	Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.
3194	Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.
3194	Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help in properly getting this information out."
3194	But Aguirre, in an interview, said he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.
3194	The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes will continue for months, perhaps years.
3194	The crisis will cost ratepayers at least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their utility bill checks.

3197	thx.
3197	jeff
3198	is this on the website?
3199	thanks
3200	I think that it would be useful for Ken to join the call.
3200	Your thoughts?
3200	Best, Jeff
3201	Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly members back.
3201	So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make a run at this.
3201	We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.
3201	Some key considerations: The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something done.
3201	The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having "done nothing."
3201	Becauase the Assembly has thus far "done nothing," the only thing it has in front of it is 78.
3201	The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided.
3201	So there's a reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out.
3201	Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where the Senate would have to approve it.
3201	Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that Burton's inclined to come back.
3201	In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes to 78, that "it's 78 or nothing."
3201	Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's amendments.
3201	Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues.
3201	All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be counted out.
3201	We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could move.
3201	Will report back as information becomes available.
3201	Best, Jeff Please respond to sgovenar
3202	Thanks very much, Ken.
3202	This is a helpful start.
3202	Best, Jeff Please respond to "Ken Smith" , "Karen Regarding the one-pager we discussed today and for discussion in a later call, I wanted to offer a suggestion on an approach. I,d like to see something simple that uses headings to show what Enron has done, what concerns remain, and the steps you expect to take in the future. I've put together some very rough sample bullet points (below) as a start tget everyone thinking and as an example of a format that could be effectiveA short preface should also be added to set up the bullets, possibly something that says Enron has been working diligently to meet elements of the committee's subpoena despite remaining disgreements. What Enron has done: Delivered x number of documents Spent x man-hours compiling information requested by the committee Retained a depository in Sacramento for documents Negotiated in good faith on a continuous basis with the committee Enron,s concerns regarding delivery of additional documents: The committee has failed to implement an acceptable confidentiality agreemethat includes sanctions for anyone who breaches the agreement Confidential documents held by the Legislature -- such as in the Quackenbuscase -- have historically found their way to the press or made public, oftein a selective manner The broad nature of the committee,s request and whether requested documeare relative to this inquiry Whether a state legislative committee has jurisdiction over activities thatinvolve interstate commerce What Enron will do: (Bullets on planned steps)
3203	Interesting points.
3203	However, I don't ever recall you agreeing with every Commission decision on disallowances.
3203	And I know you wouldn't establish differing standards for IOUs and state water agencies.
3203	I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg.
3203	You really think that Campbell is a dim bulb?
3203	A Republican, yes, but I haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb.
3203	Best, Jeff
3204	The Speaker (Hertzberg) just phoned.
3204	Been asked to attend a meeting in Sacramento at 2 PM today to discuss his latest attempt to craft a compromise solution to the energy mess.
3204	Am leaving for Sacramento now.
3204	Will report back from the meeting.
3204	Best, Jeff
3205	yes.
3206	Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version of an "Edison MOU": The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
3206	He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
3206	The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
3206	From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.
3206	The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
3206	Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's transmission.
3206	(They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to suppliers.
3206	(Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.) Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to the one created in Texas).
3206	The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new version of 82XX.
3206	The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest proposal.
3206	If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly version.
3206	Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear.
3206	Best, Jeff
3207	plz see email for CA Leg update.
3207	Best, Jeff
3208	While Leslie was out I had a brief discussion with Tycholiz, et al.

3208	Best, Jeff
3209	Just got a call from Hertzberg.
3209	He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this weekend.
3209	Too complicated; too rushed; he couldn't pull it off, but intends to continue working with folks.
3209	He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess, come back on the 20th, and try again.
3209	Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison/energy issue, the focus will now be at the CPUC, which is scheduled to rule on a rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC, Direct Access suspension, etc. at its August 23rd meeting.
3209	Best, Jeff Please forward to anyone else who needs to receive this.
3210	Go Dick.

3215	Please add, subtract, multiply as you see fit.
3215	Thanks, Jeff Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose 3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories.
3215	Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in California.
3215	Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron.
3215	Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California applies the "PX Credit" and 2) harmed EES' financial position.
3215	Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to implement the proposal in California.
3215	Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially sensitive information.
3215	Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a "demand buy-down" proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and 4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility.
3215	Worked with PR and Ken Lay to persuade California's business leaders to get involved in the effort to resolve California's energy crisis.

3220	best, Jeff
3221	Thanks, Hedy: Not good.
3221	John White has a similar view, i.e., Loretta doesn't have many choices given that the Legislature hasn't executed.
3221	John did say, however, that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other than "suspend," Loretta is likely to be amenable.
3221	Seems like it would be useful to try to get the analysis, assuming that there's legal analysis to support an alternative to "suspend."
3221	Hertzberg and I are trading calls.
3221	Will report back as soon as I hear anything.

3222	Story on the effect of FERC prices on supply in PNW.
3222	Best, Jeff Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter.
3222	The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana.
3222	"The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region."
3222	About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power plant.
3222	The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought.
3222	A turbine that size could power about 45,000 homes.
3222	"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said.
3222	After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was ready to build in time for winter.
3222	Both utilities - Tacoma Power and Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%.
3222	But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot market.
3222	NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in Washington that could have added 300 megawatts.
3222	FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open market in the past few months.
3222	The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers.
3222	In addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level.
3222	The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in June.
3222	Not Everyone Blames FERC The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months ago.
3222	Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's price controls have kept prices artificially low.
3222	A smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity.
3222	Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the cancellation of projects to price controls.
3222	"I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said.
3222	"The market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is sending now."
3222	The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months.
3222	Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer.
3222	"Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG.
3222	"The need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling."
3222	Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze.
3222	Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance.
3222	TransAlta is continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago.
3222	"The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director with the Northwest Power Planning Council.
3222	Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap.
3222	Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity."
3222	As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six months.
3222	And orders for new generators have been canceled.

3256	Greetings: With California enjoying a brief respite from Legislative antics, we plan to cancel tomorrow's California call and will reconvene on Thursday.
3256	However, if anyone has pressing matters or information they'd like to discuss tomorrow, we'll go ahead with the call.
3256	Let me know.
3256	If I've missed anyone with this note, please forward along.
3256	Thanks.

3257	we're always looking for new recruits, eh?
3258	Folks, since many law firms have failed to exit the dark ages, they continue to use wordperfect.
3258	To open this, don't launch.
3258	Instead, "detach."
3258	Then open the file that you've "detached" and it should convert from WP to word and you should be able to open it.

3261	Hope you've managed to stay a night or two in your house recently.
3261	Do you think that it would be OK to call your cousin in Sea Ranch?
3261	I have some carpentry work I'd like done on my property (panel interior of cabin; build deck and gazebo) and thought I might get him, or someone who works for/with him, or someone he could recommend to help me out.
3261	If you think he wouldn't mind having me call, might you have his phone number (and full name)?
3261	As always, greatly appreciated.
3261	FYI: Just talked to the guy from UC Davis who's in the field for Mendocino County.
3261	He says that by the sound of it, my property just might end up being All the best, Jeff
3262	Well sometime between 11 PM last night and this morning, my computer died.
3262	However, I will nonetheless get a draft of the letter out today for discussion on tomorrow's call.
3262	Given the glitch, it will likely be out by COB today.
3262	Apologies for the delay.

3263	Who would be attending?
3264	FYI.
3264	David Freeman and DWR....public power working for California.
3264	Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
3264	By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published July 31, 2001) California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.
3264	The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.
3264	"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on the governing board of the Independent System Operator.
3264	The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.
3264	Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.
3264	"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.
3264	ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves confidential bidding behavior.
3264	But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.
3264	The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.
3264	"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said.
3264	"It's not necessarily a good fit."
3264	Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines.
3264	Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing output when demand doesn't match forecasts.
3264	Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a process the industry calls "decking."
3264	But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 a megawatt-hour.
3264	Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.
3264	The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.
3264	The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less than it paid, he said.
3264	Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.
3264	By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for no good reason," Florio said.
3264	"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because they're contracted with DWR," he said.
3264	Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.
3264	In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting costs, Florio said.
3264	For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.
3264	DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a smoother-running system in place by next summer.

3267	Gouger Gray Davis California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
3267	On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis.
3267	The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants.
3267	The weather has been unseasonably cool.
3267	His poll numbers are edging back up.
3267	Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems.
3267	For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart.
3267	For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state.
3267	However, after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated."
3267	Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."
3267	Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked for."
3267	Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics.
3267	Indeed, Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.
3267	Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.
3267	California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state generators.
3267	For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 per megawatt hour.
3267	Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion.
3267	A Davis spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."
3267	Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government.
3267	Davis has signed $43 billion in ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price.
3267	The state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state power purchases.
3267	This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business.
3267	Thus, Davis' regulators are set to eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power.
3267	Who's the real gouger?
3267	No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies.
3268	Thanks.
3268	Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.

3295	It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether Davis will sign.
3295	It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (Edison bailout, etc.).
3295	Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.
3295	Will report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.
3295	Best, Jeff

3321	Good talking to you.
3321	Thanks for taking time out to have lunch with Federico.
3321	I'll be accompanying him.
3321	See you at around 11:45 on Friday.
3321	I'll forward to you shortly some brief information that Federico put together about himself in advance of his trip to the US.
3321	Best, Jeff
3322	Mike: A few thoughts: Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.
3322	If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
3322	No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.
3322	It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.
3322	That said, no shots, no ducks.
3322	We ought to make a push.
3322	The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation.
3322	It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
3322	Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
3322	The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
3322	Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
3322	All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.
3322	I'd propose that we continue with Edison.
3322	If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs.
3322	If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.
3322	On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.
3322	Some preliminary thoughts.
3322	Happy to discuss further.
3322	Best, Jeff
3323	Apologies, forgot to mention that the "consumer" groups generally don't have a problem allowing Edison to pay off its debt to the QFs.
3324	No problem.
3324	Thanks for re-forwarding.

3331	The Sacramento Bee Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m(Published Aug. 29, 2001) Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamicsThe measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court.
3331	That is odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of dollars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.
3331	Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had reached agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the utility's parent corporation.
3331	The Edison deal was announced just a few days after PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court.
3331	Both utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the last six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise retail rates.
3331	Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling aspect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed itself in receivership.
3331	Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, advertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legislature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to do.
3331	Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson?
3331	Or, as some suggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable financial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holding company, Edison International?
3331	Edison scrambled to build a fire wall after bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as strThe dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equally odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians do what they do.
3331	Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the Edison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odds.
3331	One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailout for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed under state control.
3331	Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, ordinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making such a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court.
3331	Why would Davis put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the governor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?
3331	Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" near the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual efforts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall Street would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.
3331	Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryson.
3331	The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bryson was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed by Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to launch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.
3331	The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christopher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state.
3331	Bryson and Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to take command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch the red ink.
3331	Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.
3331	We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, very soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.c|
3332	Thank you.
3333	Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
3333	Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
3333	The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
3333	The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
3333	When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
3333	If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
3333	On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.
3333	The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
3333	In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.
3333	We'll continue to provide updates.
3333	If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.
3333	Best, Jeff
3334	Great.
3334	Look forward to the call.
3335	Apologies, but any chance of doing it before noon central, or after 4 pm centra.?
3336	FYI.
3336	Figured you'd want to write a letter personally.
3336	Jeff
3337	Thanks for the info.
3337	No issues at my end.
3337	Best, Jeff
3338	See SB 85, below.
3338	Best, Jeff
3339	Thanks very much.
3339	Greatly appreciated.
3339	In response: --I'm going to stick with 7 units.
3339	Just don't have the time to take on another course.
3339	But appreciate the info and the suggestion.

3340	"Democratic leaders may bounce a Kern County lawmaker off a special committee considering a $2.9 billion rescue plan for financially ailing Southern California Edison Co. because he says he probably will vote against the plan. Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, said he will resist any move to replace him with another Democrat pledged to vote for the plan."

3341	Hey.
3341	Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite.
3341	Does the course seem like it will be good?
3341	Were there a million people there?
3341	Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.
3341	I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.
3341	Good to see you the other night.
3341	Take care.
3341	Best, Jeff
3342	I absolutely could not BELIEVE that he sent this note.
3342	Unreal.
3343	I'm signed up.
3343	Work kept me away.
3343	What happened.
3343	Do I need to be doing anything?
3343	Best, Jeff
3344	Yes.
3344	Likely not 100% of what you're looking for, but likely some info that will be useful.
3344	Best, Jeff
3345	Yes, would like a copy.
3345	Thanks.
3346	Please update with other info.

3347	The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
3347	If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
3347	It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
3347	If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
3347	That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
3347	Will report back with the events of the Assembly.
3347	Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).
3347	Best, Jeff
3348	will do.
3348	traffic permitting, around 7?
3349	Don't know.
3349	I'll find out.
3349	Any sensitivity if we had?
3349	Thanks.
3349	Best, Jeff
3350	Thanks, Scott.
3350	Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan, centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.
3350	Richmond (Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles between Rs and Ds.
3350	In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.
3350	Scott, are they meeting again on Monday, or Tuesday?
3350	Best, Jeff
3351	Thank god.
3351	I have a commrade in email humilation.
3351	Thank you, Joseph.
3351	Best, Jeff
3352	We'll review and let you know.
3352	Thanks and have a good weekend.
3352	Best, Jeff
3353	vacation all week.
3354	will do.
3354	i'll check my calendar and get right back to you.
3355	I may have school.
3355	If you could plan for it, I would be greatly indebted.
3356	Thanks.
3356	Sounds alot better than #17.
3357	I'm in. Thanks.
3358	On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
3358	The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
3358	Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
3358	The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
3358	In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
3358	The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
3358	We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
3358	We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.
3358	Best, Jeff
3359	I'm in Gloucester, Mass for the week.

3359	Happy Labor Day.
3359	Best, Jeff
3360	This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.
3360	The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.
3360	We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
3360	California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.
3360	They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.
3360	Best, Jeff State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, September 2, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers.
3360	More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped.
3360	State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses.
3360	State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California.
3360	"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said.
3360	State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission.
3360	The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday.
3360	But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday.
3360	"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers.
3360	"Which one were we supposed to take seriously?"
3360	The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts.
3360	Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases.
3360	The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law.
3360	Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers.
3360	But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power.
3360	To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access.
3360	By that time, most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices.
3360	The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions.
3360	But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts.
3360	Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman.
3360	Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer.
3360	"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients.
3360	She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down.
3360	Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law.
3360	He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled.
3360	Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts.
3360	"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said.
3360	State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers.
3360	Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone.
3360	A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs.
3360	The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said.
3360	Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services.
3360	"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

3361	Thanks.
3361	I'm in Goucester Mass this week but am getting the message to folks from here.
3361	You launching on the contracts?
3361	Best, Jeff
3362	Since the bills that passed are all Burton/Senate bills, it may be the case that a deal has been cut at the leadership level involving 78 and the other energy-related bills (SB 18 in particular).
3362	Scott, Hedy, Bev---Can you do a bit of checking to see if this is the case?
3362	Thanks very much.
3362	Best, Jeff
3363	FYI.
3363	Update on windfall profits bills.
3364	Barry: Good to meet you last week.
3364	I'm out of the office until Monday, but will get on this as soon as I return.
3364	Of this group, Dynegy is involved in the State Senate's investigation.
3364	Best, Jeff
3365	Thanks.
3365	Love to catch up on Tuesday when I get back, if that works for you.
3365	Best, Jeff
3366	Ditto.
3367	FYI.
3368	I've mentioned both Becky and Leslie to Barry.
3369	Oh boy.
3370	No Steffes?
3370	Talk to you at 1.
3370	Best, Jeff
3371	I think ours has bigger issues associated with it...
3372	Bet Mike ain't thrilled about not being the firm to draft this...How's it look thus far?
3373	Greetings.
3373	E296-1 is not showing up in my account.
3373	Best, Jeff
3374	Please disregard last note.
3374	296 is in my account.
3374	Best, Jeff
3375	So I'm assuming 1) SB 78 did NOT get out of the Assembly yesterday and 2) Bowen's DA bill did NOT get out of Senate yesterday.
3375	Is that right?
3375	Best,
3376	Hey, man, how'd the dinner go?
3376	You get everything squared away with the Legislator?
3376	Best, Jeff
3377	Greetings.
3377	You taking the course?
3377	It looks very good to me and I've added it.
3377	If you're taking it, could you let me know what the assignment is for Tuesday?
3377	I'm on vacation, and the course hasn't yet been added to my Izio account.
3377	Best, Jeff
3378	FYI.
3378	Indicates where CMTA is on key bills working their way through California's wacked out Legislature.
3378	Best, Jeff
3379	I'm in. thanks so much.
3379	Best, Jeff
3380	I'm in. Thanks.
3380	Best, Jeff
3381	FYI.
3382	I'm starting to get concerned about this.
3382	A) I didn't pick the time.
3382	B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter.
3382	Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.
3382	If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.
3382	As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.
3382	If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.
3382	I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.
3382	From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.
3382	I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.
3382	There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.
3382	These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.
3382	I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership.
3382	I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.
3382	For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year.
3382	I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.
3382	I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.
3382	And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.
3382	Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.
3382	Talk to you at noon your time.
3382	Best, Jeff
3383	Greetings Eldon and Nancy: Here are the picks.
3383	Hope you're well.
3383	Gloucester's been great.
3383	Incredible weather; New England charm; LOTS of lobster; lots of golf.
3383	We get back into town around 7 tonite.
3383	Talk to you soon.
3383	Best, Jeff
3384	I owe ya.
3384	Thanks a million.
3384	See you tomorrow nite.
3384	Best, Jeff
3385	We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.
3385	Seems there would be two issues that might concern us: 1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.
3385	Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.
3385	Thoughts?
3385	Best, Jeff
3386	I'm hearing that it may be as early as today or tomorrow.
3386	Best, Jeff
3387	Thank you.
3388	I agree.
3388	Sue, I'm willing to join Mike in a meeting with Bilas.
3388	Mike, can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning?
3388	Sue: Can you meet with Brown/Gamson?
3388	Others have thoughts about these meetings?
3388	PS Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.
3388	Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron."
3388	Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.
3388	Best, Jeff
3389	We are OUT of the pool.
3389	I want my money back.
3389	Prentice, please get your stuff out of my apartment.
3389	You can have the cats.
3389	Love, Jeff Thanks for helping, Nancy.
3389	So what place are we in?
3390	FYI: To update what we've learned today regarding possibility of Senate going forward on Wed.
3390	with contempt.
3390	At this point, appears they intend to go forward.
3390	Best, Jeff
3391	See email.
3391	Call w/Sanders et al @ 5PM CDT to update contempt action.
3391	Best, Jeff
3392	See my and Sue's email.
3393	>FYI.
3393	Please keep confidential.
3393	John White's trying to go after the contracts.
3393	Hap Boyd, who's on his Board, is opposing John's action and asking him not to go forward.
3393	Too bad.
3393	He was ready to launch.
3393	Not sure what Hap's sensitivities are.
3393	John's asked me not to intervene at this point.
3393	Best,
3394	What do you think?
3395	Tee hee (ki barber)
3396	Seriously?
3396	(I'd be happy to.)
3397	The Senate Rules Committee just met.
3397	During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that: the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).
3397	the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.
3397	That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.
3397	If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.
3397	Burton generally sticks to his word.
3397	But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by.
3397	However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.
3397	Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.
3397	More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.
3397	Best, Jeff
3398	Hear you're in London.
3398	Hope you're OK.
3398	Unfathomable tragedy.
3398	We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.
3398	Call will be brief.
3398	With respect to Hap, John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals.
3398	I agreed.
3398	I'll keep you posted.
3398	The State Capitol is closed down completely today.
3398	Be safe.
3398	Best, Jeff
3399	We continue to attempt to kill the hearing altogether.
3399	Will advise with info as it happens.
3399	Best, Jeff
3400	FYI.
3400	Please keep to yourself at this point.
3400	You hear anything from Norm about the PUC machinations?
3401	how we doing on the one-pager?
3402	FYI.
3403	Thanks very much for dinner, the guacamole and the company.
3403	I left you a check for the truck window work on the kitchen counter.
3403	(That was the best dinner I've ever had in my entire life! kidding! :) ) Hope that you're not getting beat up by your bomb-throwing colleagues.
3403	Best, Jeff
3404	Thanks very much again for getting the truck window fixed.
3404	I left a check on the kitchen counter.
3404	Best, Jeff
3405	FYI.
3405	Unless I hear from you, I'm telling Hap that it's fine.
3405	Best, Jeff
3406	Hap: I've been in a panic.
3406	I will review shortly and get back to you just as soon as I can.
3406	Best, Jeff
3407	In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.
3407	Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.
3407	Best, Jeff
3408	You getting these?
3408	You care?
3409	Hap: Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.
3409	Do you have particular concerns?
3409	I'll call you to discuss further.
3409	Best, Jeff
3410	This work for you?
3410	Lemme know.
3410	Best, Jeff
3411	no need for invoice.

3416	Can you get there direct?
3416	If not, let's do LAX, but Burbank is preferrable.
3416	Less of a zoo.
3416	Best, Jeff
3417	I think it would be great for us to have one.
3417	Man, it's tough using that thing.
3417	You gals sounded great from Prentice's bedroom when you were doing the final cuts.
3417	Are we getting a copy?
3417	Might be nice to have a copy of the "raw" tape.
3417	Best, Jeff
3418	DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
3418	In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
3418	Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.
3418	Best, Jeff
3419	FYI.
3420	Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
3420	In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
3420	This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.
3420	A story related to the deal is attached.
3420	If you have any questions, just let me know.
3420	Best, Jeff
3421	I think Sanders has always thought that the Reliant deal offers sufficient protections.
3421	Not sure that Kirby and Gibb agree.

3424	Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA 94111
3425	Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.
3425	The provisions could--and likely will--change.
3425	The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.
3425	No suspension of DA.
3425	All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not.
3425	Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.
3425	Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.
3425	The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.
3425	Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.
3426	This is the last straw: Peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue.
3426	He then went on ad nauseum--and I mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world.
3426	Unreal.
3426	I told him that in exchange, we expected him to get rid of Bill Lockyear.
3426	Richard: He complained a little about Kirby.
3426	I told him Kirby was worth his weight in gold.
3426	Best, Jeff
3427	Immediately?
3428	Thank you.
3429	Kean, Kirby, Gibb, me.
3429	Lots of fun.
3429	Not.
3429	Best, Jeff
3430	My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.
3430	Apologies.
3430	About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
3430	Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
3430	Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
3430	Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.
3430	The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
3430	Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.
3430	A press account and Davis' statement are attached.
3430	Best, Jeff GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win approval in the California State Senate.
3430	"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness. Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done. "It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000 Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers.
3430	We worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts, back on-line earlier this summer.
3430	"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint."
3430	California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer Saturday, September 15, 2001 ?2001 Associated Press URL: The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.
3430	As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval.
3430	So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.
3430	But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison.
3430	They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.
3430	"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton.
3430	"It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."
3430	The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.
3430	Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility.
3430	The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs.
3430	Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.
3430	The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.
3430	"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday.
3430	"Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."
3430	The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores.
3430	They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.
3430	The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law.
3430	Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.
3430	It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.
3430	While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.
3430	Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.
3430	The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.
3430	The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.
3430	"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

3431	Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.
3431	I'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.
3431	We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter.
3431	Reliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up.
3431	They would of course love to have Enron "lead the charge."
3431	I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose.
3431	Best, Jeff
3432	Dear folks: Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.
3432	I would very much like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school has started (last year!).
3432	Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.
3432	I'm going to have to cancel.
3432	If there are any charges, please let me know.
3432	Hope to see all of you very soon.
3432	Be safe.
3432	Best, Jeff
3433	Jim: FYI.
3434	No, I don't think so.
3434	Haley and Wil's vocabularies may expanded a bit, though.
3434	Thanks again for having them.
3434	Very kind of you.
3434	Best, Jeff PS You guys get all the cards.
3435	I actually did get them, it appear.
3435	Apologies.
3436	Sweetheart, very sorry to hear.
3436	You're in my thoughts and prayers and I hope you're doing OK.
3436	Sometimes, things just aren't very fair.
3436	Best, Jeff
3437	You ain't kidding.
3437	Hope you and yours are OK, given the circumstances.
3437	All the best.
3437	Jeff
3438	Thanks for the invite, but I have class.
3438	She have a job yet?
3439	I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday.
3440	Thanks.
3441	There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.
3441	We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.
3441	It is attached.
3441	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).
3441	Best, Jeff
3442	You take care.
3442	If for whatever reason, there's anything I can do, please just ask.
3442	Best, Jeff
3443	Here's the proposal: There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
3443	The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.) If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.
3443	Thoughts?
3443	Best, Jeff
3444	Just talked to Fielder.
3444	U have 5 minutes to debrief?
3444	Sending this to Kean/Shapiro/Steffes.
3444	Jeff
3445	Gee, now that's a "rib"-tickler.
3446	Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.
3446	The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
3446	The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.
3446	The Legislature's options: 1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
3446	2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.
3446	However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3446	3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.
3446	In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.
3446	Where to from here?
3446	Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
3446	Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."
3446	The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.
3446	The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.
3446	Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.
3446	It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
3446	With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.
3446	We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
3446	Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said: Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
3446	He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
3446	With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.
3446	If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.
3446	We'll report back with additional information as we get it.
3446	Best, Jeff
3447	Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.
3447	As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.
3447	The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.
3447	That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks.
3447	Let's regroup.
3447	Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E.
3447	Thoughts?
3447	Best, Jeff
3448	Sounds good.
3448	How about first thing tomorrow morning for a call?
3449	Religion, huh?
3449	Interesting.
3449	Your folks may disown you, though.
3449	I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?
3449	The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.
3449	Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.
3449	The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?
3449	Next week or week after?
3449	(May want to wait until plane service gets normal?) Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?
3449	Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!
3449	Sell the flat, dammit.
3449	Kisses, Jeff PS Colleen doing OK?
3449	I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are....
3450	FYI.
3451	Thank you.
3452	Left him a message earlier.
3452	Haven't heard back yet.
3452	I'll call him again first thing in the AM.
3452	He's probably busy getting his number changed.
3452	Best, Jeff
3453	Greetings.
3453	I can't recall if I received the contact?
3453	If so, I apologize for misplacing it.
3453	Could you send it again?
3453	Much appreciated?
3453	Best, Jeff
3454	Greetings: 1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).
3454	His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.
3454	I'm trying to track him down.
3454	2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?
3454	Best, Jeff
3455	Thanks very much.
3456	Not sure.
3456	Am checking around.
3456	Will let you know when I find out.
3456	Best, Jeff
3457	Assuming you've seen this.
3457	But just in case, here it is.
3457	Fairly interesting.
3457	Best, Jeff
3458	Call when you can.
3458	Best, Jeff
3459	Greetings, Jim.
3459	Just checking in. Hope, given the circumstances that all finds you well.
3459	Look forward to hearing from you.
3459	Best, Jeff
3460	Got your message.
3460	Which bill?
3460	Could you try Scott Govenar (916.448.8240), since he's the lord of all bill activity?
3460	Thanks a bunch.
3460	Best, Jeff
3461	Greetings.
3461	Hope, given the circumstances, that you're well.
3461	I'm trying to get a hold of Mark Baldwin, and the number I have gets a recording saying that it ain't the number anymore.
3461	Do you have a number for him.
3461	Greatly appreciated.
3461	Best, Jeff
3462	OK, I'm getting the meetings set up.
3462	What day do you want?
3462	And what about the pilot--need info, over.
3462	And who's you're knight in shining armor in EES?
3462	Best, Jeff
3463	Thanks.
3464	Greetings.
3464	Steve Harris says that you might have a number for Mark Baldwin.
3464	Possible to get it from you.
3464	Thanks very much.
3464	Best, Jeff
3465	Thanks.
3465	Did he change companies, or just phone numbers?
3465	Best, Jeff
3466	Got Mark's number.
3466	I'm going to call him today.
3466	Any specific info you'd like to have, or just generally what he and DWR are up to on the gas side.
3466	I also assume that we'd like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities?
3466	Best, Jeff
3467	thanks.
3468	Let me see what I can do.
3468	So this is all about sourcing, or are you aiming higher?
3469	Uggh.
3469	I think I'm at Stanford that evening.
3470	Sweetie, what happened?
3470	How'd you hurt your back?
3470	So sorry.
3470	And SO sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.
3470	I really wanted to see you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.
3470	Another day, I guess.
3470	Take care of that back.
3470	Herniated disks are bad, so take care.
3470	Best, Jeff
3471	You mean Bob Lane?
3472	I'll get it.
3472	He's in Boston now.
3473	Dude: I need your phone number, pronto!
3474	Bob's number is: 617.567.8877.
3474	It's his home number.
3474	Feel free to call him there.
3474	Best, Jeff
3475	We're ready when u are.
3475	best, jeff
3476	Here's a start.
3476	Be happy to add.
3476	Just let me know.
3476	Best, Jeff Paul Clanon--Chief, Energy Division General Counsel (don't know name) CEC-- Chairman of Commission Chief of power plant siting department Person in charge of "green marketing" (Stacey Bolton will know who the person is) Dan Kirshner, EDF, Oakland V. John White, Sierra Club, Sacramento Consumer reps--Mike Florio, TURN, SF Michael Shames, UCAN, San Diego
3477	Bob's home number might be 617.567.8871 (rather than 8877).
3477	His cell phone is 415.713.4473.
3477	Best, Jeff
3478	Going down to Fielder's for a bar-b-que tonite, watch a little TV and get this thing settled.
3478	Seriously, he and I have traded messages today.
3478	When we hook up, I'm going to ask him when we can meet and get this settled.
3478	I'll let you know what he says as soon as I hear back.
3478	Best, Jeff
3479	Left a message for Mark.
3479	He's out today and will call me back tomorrow.
3479	Best, Jeff
3480	Talked to Fielder.
3480	He's willing to meet.
3480	Jeff
3481	No problem.
3481	If you need anything else, just let me know.
3482	Thanks.
3482	Look forward to talking soon.
3482	Don't work too hard.
3482	Best, Jeff
3483	Thanks.
3483	See you tomorrow night in the tah moh.
3484	Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
3484	He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
3484	I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC. I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue. He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days). He suggested that we start without lawyers. I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check. I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do. Possible to discuss briefly? Best, Jeff
3485	Thanks, Jeff.
3485	Ross, when you get a chance, give me a call at 415.782.7822.
3485	Best, Jeff
3486	Send what?
3486	Nothing was attached.
3487	Jeff: Ross is out for the week.
3487	Is there someone who Ross works for that I could contact?
3487	Thanks much.
3487	Best, Jeff
3488	That ain't gonna do it, in my view.
3488	We're going to need to be creative.
3488	Figure what number we'll take and how we'll take it and get out.
3488	Note that Edison is going to be very wary of showing any "preferential treatment," lest another creditor get wind of it and yank them in on an involuntary.
3488	I'm going to call Tribolet and get his thoughts.
3488	I'll let you know what he says.
3488	Best, Jeff
3489	Greetings.
3489	We ever hear back from Richard regarding whether we agreed to any time frame for delivering documents?
3489	Best, Jeff PS Remind me to thank Forbes for that great article (not).
3490	We better get tickets now?
3491	Dude: Please let me know all the various costs that you've incurred on our behalf and not been compensated for.
3491	I know we owe you $65(?) dollars for the guitar.
3491	Is there anything else?
3491	Let's play soon.
3491	Best, Jeff
3492	Thanks.
3492	Is it safe to say, from you notes, that DealBench is "winding down?"
3492	Best, Jeff
3493	Yes.
3493	But I'm not sure what it is.
3494	Any time.
3494	Just call.
3495	sigh....
3496	I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot.
3496	He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.
3496	I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.
3496	Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.
3496	I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
3496	I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.
3496	He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.
3496	There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev.
3496	req.
3496	The reason: no urgency anymore.
3496	Let's take a little time and get it right.
3496	Best, Jeff
3497	If it's possible to talk around 3 pm California time for about 10-15 minutes, that would be great.
3497	Would need to get Jim and Rick on the call, too.
3497	Don't break your back, but would be very good if we could arrange it.
3497	Just let me know.
3497	Thanks a million.
3497	Best, Jeff
3498	Thank you.
3498	I was trying to get the number from Barry.
3499	will do.
3500	Interesting assist from Jones?
3501	Thanks a bunch.
3502	Thanks.
3502	Don't hesitate if there's anything else.
3502	We're trying to get Bilas and Duque on board.
3502	Best, Jeff
3503	can we make it 6 your time, 4 my time for the call?
3503	jeff
3504	FYI.
3505	thanks so much.
3505	please call me at office.
3505	best, Jeff
3506	Just found out that the best way to reach Bob Lane is on his cell phone at: 415-713-4473.
3506	Best, Jeff
3507	I'll give you a call.
3507	Man, were you all over NPR or what with that Telco story?
3507	Give my best to Tina.
3507	Best, Jeff
3508	yes.
3508	send through.
3509	FYI.
3510	Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting.
3510	However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively.
3510	As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
3510	In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.
3510	We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.
3510	Best, Jeff
3511	Greetings Colleen: I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.
3511	I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.
3511	If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.
3511	Please let me know how else we can help.
3511	Best, Jeff
3512	Greetings.
3512	Did you folks ever send a letter to the PUC?
3512	If so, is it possible to get a copy?
3512	Best, Jeff
3513	Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.
3513	With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.
3513	The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.
3513	If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.
3513	Best, Jeff
3514	You should contact Tim directly.
3514	There is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words.
3514	The utilities issue reports on OFO incidents, and Tim should have those as well.
3514	Let me know if there's anything we can do.
3514	Best, Jeff
3515	FYI.
3515	You know if Tim's still at Enron?
3515	I haven't heard from him for quite some time.
3515	Best, Jeff
3516	Can you reschedule this to 3 PM our time?
3516	Mucho Appreciado.
3516	Best, Jeff
3517	Oh joy.
3518	will do.
3519	code 92105
3520	Talked to Mark.
3520	First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
3520	He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
3520	I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
3520	He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
3520	He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
3520	I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
3520	I asked him what sort of deals they're working on.
3520	As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.
3520	So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.
3520	Best, Jeff
3521	u wanna go?
3522	Thanks.
3522	We do not have internet access here.
3522	Would you please see if they post a more detailed version of the proposal, and, if so, distribute.
3522	Thanks.
3522	(This is going to blow the roof off in California.) Best, Jeff
3523	FYI.
3523	This is likely to create a considerable stir in California.
3523	Let the games begin...
3523	Best, Jeff
3524	FYI
3525	Sounds good.
3525	Best, Jeff
3526	Thanks alot.
3526	Best, Jeff
3527	Getting alot of inquiries.
3527	The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
3527	Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
3527	Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.
3527	In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
3527	Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).
3527	KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.
3527	We'll report back as soon as something happens.
3527	For folks who want to listen in, the number is: Best, Jeff
3528	I got the "joke."
3529	Is there an attachment?
3530	You interested in these messages?
3531	Wood say issue of contract renewal put off for further examination?
3531	jeff
3532	PLZ CALL.
3532	DIDN'T GET WHETHER RENEWAL IS COVERED OR NOT.
3532	JEFF 415.505.6633.
3533	voted out date of 9.20.01.
3533	trying to determine ability to go back to july 1 and whether renewal is clearly covered.
3533	jeff
3534	Will let you know as soon as we get it figured out.
3534	Best, Jeff
3535	The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
3535	The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
3535	But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.
3535	In short, that battle continues.
3535	How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
3535	The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.
3535	Best, Jeff
3536	Thanks very much.
3536	Please thank Mark.
3536	Best, Jeff
3537	The Commission also delayed a decision on whether contract renewal will be included under the suspension.
3537	Jeff
3538	Dan.
3538	You might want to amend.
3538	The decision puts everyone on notice that the Commission is going to consider taking it back to July 1---no info on what the decision process would be.
3538	Best, Jeff
3539	Please email Joseph Alamo with your fax number if you would like a copy.
3539	Best, Jeff
3540	Will get back to you.
3541	I figured that's what happened.
3541	Faxing as we speak.
3541	Best, Jeff
3542	will do.
3543	you mean to hold it?
3544	Apologies for missing the call yesterday.
3544	As I'm sure you're aware, yesterday the PUC voted to suspend electric direct acces in California.
3544	As a result, it was an extremely hectic day.
3544	I do intend to make the weekly calls.
3544	Best, Jeff
3545	Hey, when do regional directors begin reporting to Steffes?
3545	Any sense of the reasoning behing the org change?
3546	Thanks for coming over last night.
3546	Very fun.
3546	Great to see you.
3546	Really glad you guys joined in. Best, Jeff
3547	That's exactly right.
3547	But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.
3547	Best, Jeff PS Can you give a call when you get a minute at 415.782.7822?
3547	Thanks.
3548	Mike: Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?
3548	I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.
3548	Thanks.
3548	Best, Jeff
3549	An SVP from Edison just informed us that Edison will be sending out by email information on DASR acceptance/rejection.
3549	He said that all DASRs submitted prior to midnight on 9.20.01 will be accepted, irrespective of whether Edison subsequently rejected them for inadequate information, adminstrative or other reasons.
3549	He said that they will also be asking ESPs to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 9.20.01 and for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.
3549	When the DASRs for those contracts are submitted, he said that Edison will accept them, so long as they track the list previously submitted.
3549	I asked if Edison would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1.
3549	He said he didn't believe they intended to do that, but he said that they did intend to lobby the Commission to make sure that newly-minted DA customers don't escape any costs they're responsible for.
3549	Please forward this along to anyone else who might need the information.
3549	Best, Jeff
3550	Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend.
3550	As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.
3550	As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).
3550	You guys up for golf?
3550	You plan on doing the anniversary thing?
3550	Best, Jeff PS Where's my email Ms Perfect?
3551	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
3551	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.
3551	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
3551	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues: 1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).
3551	Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.
3551	Best, Jeff
3552	Thanks very much.
3553	Being a patent maven and auction babe, thought you might find interest in this.
3553	Best, Jeff Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2) 2001-09-21 16:39 (New York) Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2) (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.) Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic trading system.
3553	Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May 2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.'' Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly using that patented technology through its Internet-based electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept. 17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas.
3553	Enron trades commodities such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.
3553	Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing the patent, and is asking for damages.
3553	EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in November 1999.
3553	Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685 billion, the company has said.
3553	Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal, paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.
3553	``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,'' said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.
3553	Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.
3554	Could we get a copy of the letters referenced in the story?
3554	415.782.7854.
3555	Thanks alot.
3556	thanks.
3557	Michael Tribolet and I are scheduled to meet with Fielder on Monday, Oct 1.
3557	at 10 AM to test the waters for a possible settlement of our PX credit claim with Edison.
3557	If the Governor calls a special session to begin Oct 1, I'd guess that Edison will try to delay the meeting.
3557	Best, Jeff
3558	o lord, there's not some reason that we'll need to go to Napa next weekend that I don't know about, it there?
3558	Just you guys going up to visit, right?
3559	why did we agree to give Rod Wright $20K?
3559	Hey, we kid!
3559	Where'd we be without our humor?
3559	Have a great weekend; thanks for taking the time to talk today.
3559	Best, Jeff PS What was that package again?
3560	you forgot "he's SO bright."
3560	and I forgot "personal friend."
3560	thanks for the laugh.
3560	by the way, I'll be in houston all next week cozying up to important people|
3561	This won't work.
3561	Try again, please.
3561	KIDDING!
3561	Looks great.
3561	Thanks.
3561	I'll forward along to Greg and Brad and get back to you soon as I know something.
3561	Toodles, Jeff
3562	Overall looks great, though I made a few edits/comments.
3562	But I couldn't figure out how to do it in strikeout/underline.
3562	We should make it look as "PG&E-centric" as possible--you know how touchy IOUs are.
3562	You and Dave and I should try to discuss in more detail early next week.
3562	Best, Jeff
3563	thanks for the tip.
3563	maybe i'll run into you on my way to the top....
3563	seriously, have a great weekend.
3563	i'll be studying.
3563	Best, Jeff
3564	thanks.
3565	FYI.
3565	Could be pretty explosive if evidence turns up confirming the market's suspicions.
3565	Best, Jeff
3566	FYI.
3567	There's a tourney tomorrow, and those NOT in the tourney can play on a first-come, first-serve basis from noon to 2PM.
3567	I say that we get to the club by 11:45 AM.
3567	You guys game?
3568	Sounds good.
3568	Just let me know if you'd like to set up the call, or if you'd like me to do it.
3568	Best, Jeff
3569	Will do.
3569	Jeff
3570	FYI.
3571	FYI.
3571	Per my voicemail--response from Jeremy regarding our approach to last week's PUC decision.
3571	We'll set up a call for later in the day.
3571	Best, Jeff
3572	See list of folks below.
3572	I'll forward you another email with the name of Jeremy's asst., with whom you'll need to coordinate to get a call set up for later today.
3572	Thanks very much for your help.
3572	From our side, please include Sue and Rick and me.
3572	Best, Jeff
3573	Hi Sharon: Our asst.
3573	Joseph Alamo (415.782.7841) will work with you to arrange a call.
3573	Thanks to you both for you help.
3573	Best, Jeff
3574	Rick: We need to add Janet on the call with Belden and Vicki?
3574	Best, Jeff
3575	Thanks.
3575	Good luck.
3575	Should be interesting.
3575	Best, Jeff
3576	Will do.
3576	Won't have it expand beyond that, unless Belden, Vicki or Janet specifically want someone else.
3576	Best, Jeff
3577	Centrica's gain.
3577	Enron's loss.
3577	The very best of luck to you.
3577	It certainly has been a pleasure and I hope our paths cross again soon.
3577	All the best, Jeff
3578	Thanks.
3579	Thank you.
3579	Pretty interesting.
3580	you got it.
3581	Steve: Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.
3581	On the plus side: He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.
3581	He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.
3581	His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.
3581	On the negative side: In each and every case that Rod has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first.
3581	Here are three examples (and there are more): 1) During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a "stranded cost charge" for utilities.
3581	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.
3581	How many times must Californians pay?
3581	We worked with consumer and business groups to oppose the bill.
3581	2) In the "alternative MOU" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison.
3581	3) Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and billing services.
3581	Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.
3581	Hope this helps.
3581	If you need any other information, just let me know.
3581	Best, Jeff
3582	I have one tomorrow (09.25.01) at 10 AM.
3583	Scott: Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).
3583	You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.
3583	And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.
3583	If you have any questions, just holler.
3583	Best, Jeff The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.
3583	The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).
3583	The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.
3583	The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.
3583	The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.
3583	The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.
3583	The Decision's purported findings are not supported.
3583	The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.
3584	You have a sense that the Alan departure was coming?
3584	Too bad.
3584	Nice, very capable guy.
3584	Best, Jeff
3585	For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).
3585	We'll try to use the same call-in number.
3585	Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?
3585	Please let me know if this change presents a problem for anyone.
3585	Best, Jeff
3586	Oops.
3586	Yeah, Aleck.
3586	Too bad.
3586	Talked to Sue.
3586	She's fine with it.
3586	Will call Pat shortly.
3587	Here's where I left off: At least 3 things that need to be included: 1.
3587	Port exercises prepay.
3587	2.
3587	ABM sells lease (capital gains?).
3587	Take a peek and let me know what you think.
3587	Kisses, Jeff
3588	2:30-4:00 (CDT)
3589	Could you please refresh my memory of the other person in the group who's working on California?
3589	Thanks a bunch.
3589	Best, Jeff
3590	Thanks.
3590	My apologies, Melinda.
3590	I will remember.
3590	Bear with me.
3590	Lots of new names associated with California these days.
3590	Best, Jeff
3591	Thanks again for your gracious hospitality over the weekend and a very happy anniversary.
3591	Eldon, you were particularly nice to let me win at just about everything we did.
3591	How much do I owe you for me and Prentice for the golf?
3591	Best, Jeff
3592	For anyone who hasn't seen it already, attached is an electronic version of California's PUC's decision to suspend DA.
3592	Also attached at the end of the order is a very strong dissent signed by Commissioners Bilas and Duque.
3592	Best, Jeff
3593	FYI.
3593	Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.
3593	Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.
3593	Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.
3593	Best, Jeff
3594	FYI: On the call today with Jeremy Blachman & Co. today, we decided to the do the following: Sue will make sure that EES legal (Mike Smith) reviews ARMs petition to modify the Commission's order suspending DA.
3594	Sue will send Jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and Jeremy will use it to solicit participation from Enron customers (i.e., see if any are willing to sign the petition).
3594	Jeff will work with Karen Denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to Legislators in the event Davis is successful in calling them back in October to work on energy matters.
3594	Let us know if you have any questions.
3594	Best, Jeff
3595	u read it?
3596	Will do.
3596	Ain't got a chance to call him yet, but will do so by COB today.
3596	Agree we need to get it nailed down, period.
3597	I was trembling.
3597	I mean, it read like a chilling cold-war spy novel.
3597	Can barely write.
3597	I'm quivering all over....
3598	FYI.
3599	You're a better consumer advocate than apologist.
3599	I'll resend the document first thing in the AM.
3599	Best, Jeff
3600	So I'm assuming that you support the plan?
3600	Best, Jeff
3601	That makes at least two of us!
3601	Hope you're doing well.
3601	We intend to continue to fight vigorously to re-instate direct access in California.
3601	Hope we'll be able to work together to get choice back.
3601	Best, Jeff
3602	Mike: 1) Attached is the CSFS report on the reorg and some recent press.
3602	2) Learning to let go is good thing.
3602	Best, Jeff
3603	I've been informed that the CSFB report on PG&E's reorg didn't make it first time round.
3603	Trying again.
3603	Best, Jeff
3604	Not surprising, but thought you might be interested.
3604	I responded that letting go is a good thing.
3604	Best, Jeff
3605	Sent you guys a check yesterday for $120 for me and Prentice.
3605	Let me know if that covers gold on Saturday.
3605	Best, Jeff Go Barry!
3606	The person's name at Calpine is Jim Macias (he's a vice president there).
3606	His number 408.995.5115.
3606	Thanks again, Marchris.
3606	How'd the conversation go?
3606	If there's anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate.
3606	Best, Jeff
3607	Anything interesting (particularly with respect to ISO market manipulation) come out of yesterday's meeting?
3607	Best, Jeff
3608	Not a problem.
3608	Will call in about 30 minutes.
3608	Best, Jeff
3609	Dorothy, if you can get it to the DA Coalition that would be great.
3609	I'm also sending to Delainey to distribute to the other biz folks.
3609	Best, Jeff
3610	Here it is.
3610	If you could get it to all the usual suspects, that would be great.
3610	Best, Jeff
3611	I'm back from the doctor.
3611	I'll just take the time against lunch (i.e., I'll work through lunch), so no need to worry about any time accounting.
3611	If there's any issues with that approach, just let me know.
3611	Thanks a bunch.
3611	Best, Jeff
3612	Talked to Pat Mason.
3612	Give a call when you get a chance.
3612	Jeff
3613	I thought that you said it was $60/person?
3614	I'll keep that in mind...
3615	Thanks.
3616	Two things: When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?
3616	If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?
3616	Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.
3616	His concerns are two-fold: Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with.
3616	And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).
3616	I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.
3617	Thanks.
3618	Did I tell you that Fawcett left for greener pastures?
3619	You saw my previous email?
3620	It appears that Davis has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the Edison issue.
3620	Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.
3620	We'll report back when we get additional information.
3620	There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a "task force" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.
3620	Burton is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that "this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over."
3620	Best, Jeff
3621	Really appreciate it.
3621	I'll be up there this weekend.
3621	If you, or one of your guys, want to drop by, I think that we could pencil it out in about 30 minutes.
3621	Let me know if that works for you.
3621	And thanks again.
3621	Really appreciate it.
3621	Best, Jeff
3622	See story below.
3622	State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis.
3622	The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record.
3622	And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year.
3622	With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002.
3622	The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said.
3622	"We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11."
3622	Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services.
3622	Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission.
3622	The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November.
3622	But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities.
3622	With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.
3622	This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said.
3622	But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002.
3622	Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment.
3622	"I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action.
3622	Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes.
3622	The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape.
3622	In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings.
3622	No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus.
3622	But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs.
3622	Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes.
3622	Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers.
3622	"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms.
3622	"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said.
3622	The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion.
3622	That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent.
3622	The notes mature June 28, 2002.
3622	Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent.
3622	Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated."
3622	Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."
3623	Sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw, I'm next in line for meetings with Brown.
3623	I've asked Mike Day to set up a meeting with Brown, me and Mike to begin our efforts to rehabilitate Mr. Brown.
3623	Best, Jeff
3624	See what a good night sleep can do!
3624	We'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list.
3625	If u and others are trying to get on CA call, pls call my line at 415.782.7822.
3625	jeff
3626	hmmm.
3626	my understanding is that prentice has a full plate this weekend, but don't know her precise schedule, so I was going to the dome to meet with dottie's cousin and the apple tree guy, and try to make some more progress finishing the cabin.
3627	Thanks.
3627	We'll report back with any additional information that we hear.
3627	Reports are that Davis is expected to issue today whatever it is that he would issue to call the 3rd X session and call back the merry band of (probably very grumpy) legislators.
3627	Best, Jeff
3628	Just so we're clear.
3628	To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation," and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.
3628	In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers.
3628	Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.
3628	Very interesting.
3628	Best, Jeff
3629	Can you send the draft letter Tracy refers to re: letter to legislators?
3630	thanks.
3631	FYI.
3631	ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of California's energy deregulation - consumer choice.
3631	With commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that requires customers to buy power from their local utility company is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy purchases.
3631	The negative impact on California businesses, some already in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said.
3631	It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25,
3632	FYI.
3633	Greg: Good talking to you.
3633	Congratulations on your new role.
3633	Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).
3633	Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.
3633	The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are: Ian Sullivan SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product Cameron Sellers VP, Business Development They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th.
3633	Let me know if that works for you and Brad.
3633	Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.
3633	I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.
3633	I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
3633	From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.
3633	The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford).
3633	Glad you guys can meet with them.
3633	I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.
3633	Best, Jeff
3634	you got it.
3634	thanks.
3635	Sue: Just talked to the Chamber.
3635	Add them to the petition for rehearing.
3635	CMTA will be back to me soon.
3635	If they don't sign it's only because they'll file separately, but I think they're likely to join ARM's.
3635	Best, Jeff
3636	The meeting will happen.
3636	Will only be a matter of who attends.
3636	I'll let you know what I hear back.
3636	Good luck with everything else.
3636	Best, Jeff
3637	Greetings Eve and Bill: This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.
3637	It's originating with AreM.
3637	Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.
3637	The Chamber's already agreed to join.
3637	If we're to have any hope of a) maintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.
3637	Please see attached.
3637	We hope that you can join.
3637	All the best, Jeff
3638	now for that bad news.
3638	call me.
3638	415.782.7822.
3639	Anything of note from the FERC/ISO/Generator meetings?
3640	Could you check and see if the Roundtable would like to sign on?
3640	Thanks alBest, Jeff
3641	Sounds like some pretty good movement.
3641	Congratz.
3642	FYI.
3642	Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.
3642	Word on DA is not good.
3642	Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.
3642	Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.
3642	In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.
3642	This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.
3642	Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.
3642	The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.
3642	We'll report back with news as we get it.
3642	Best, Jeff
3643	Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis.
3643	By Amy Chance Bee Political Editor (Published Sept. 26, 2001) Gov. Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found.
3643	The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent.
3643	Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo.
3643	"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said.
3643	"It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis."
3643	In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent.
3643	Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided.
3643	The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent.
3643	Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading."
3643	"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said.
3643	"These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general."
3643	DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis.
3643	In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent.
3643	In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent.
3643	Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent.
3643	"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said.
3643	"He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. "No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race.
3643	This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative."
3643	DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. "It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way."
3643	South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. "We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942."

3645	I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that: 1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and, 2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.
3645	Could I get your fax numbers?
3645	Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.
3645	Thanks.
3645	Best, Jeff
3646	Just heard from Michael Rochman of SPURR/REMAC.
3646	He wants to sign on .
3647	got it.
3648	Sounds reasonable.
3648	Let me know what time you can meet this weekend.
3648	After noon on Saturday, and anytime before 4 pm on Sunday works great for me.
3648	Understanding that it's a T&M job, would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it?
3648	Also, I've got some longer range plans (barn, house, etc.) for the property that I'd like to run by you, too, but that's longer off.
3648	Really want to get the deck done before the rain starts.
3648	Thanks again.
3648	Best, Jeff
3649	You should have it already.
3649	Give me a call when you get a minute.
3649	Thanks.
3649	Jeff
3650	I'll forward to them.
3651	you should have this.
3651	i sent it out yesterday.
3651	the scapegoating continues....
3652	Haven't heard anything about it, though Sue's been closer to these issues.
3653	Congratulations and best of luck.
3653	Hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you, given your new responsibilities.
3653	Big country to cover.
3653	All the best, Jeff
3654	For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.
3654	Option 3 is the most prudent, and preferable, path.
3654	Best, Jeff
3655	talked to karen.
3655	thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.
3655	and we're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.
3655	i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.
3655	we can always do dinner with david and nina.
3655	how's things?
3656	attachment?
3657	babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet.
3657	nevertheless, you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?
3657	anywho, let's see what response i get back.
3657	maybe they'll want to push back.
3657	her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place previously).
3657	now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even more gorgeous (if that's possible).
3657	best, Jeff
3658	meet for a drink after work?
3659	FYI.
3659	Don't think it's anything that raises any concerns, but since you're signing on, thought you might want to peruse.
3659	Best, Jeff
3660	couldn't agree more.
3660	was just kidding.
3661	you rock.
3661	cleca signing on?
3662	Really don't want to write anymore notes.
3662	while he's a friend, and i've known him since he was a lowly VP, sending lots of emails to CEOs, even in a flat org.
3662	like enron, is, well, bad form.
3662	let's see what happens.
3662	just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take place prior to the EES debrief.
3662	The cooking thing is great.
3662	The funniest thing is that Prentice has always said that she hates rice, and therefore risotto.
3662	so i'm psyched.
3663	yes, dear.
3664	no.
3664	what's your phone number.
3664	need to fill you in on some stuff.
3664	best, Jeff
3665	No kidding.
3665	However, it's safe to say that all concerned believe that your comparably quality and well-equipped to fill his shoes.
3665	Hope to see you on the golf course soon.
3666	Slight correction.
3666	If, in fact, they actually come back next week, we'll likely stay with Tues/Thur.
3666	If they end up NOT coming back, we may cancel regular call altogether, and continue for rest-of-year on "as needed" basis.
3666	But we're still figuring and will get back to you.
3666	We'll know more when we know more about what the heck the legislature is going to do, or not do.
3666	Best, Jeff
3667	I asked scott and hedy to fill ken in on the change for this week.
3667	looks like ball got dropped.
3667	poor ken.
3668	you're not billing by the word now are you?
3668	:)
3669	No problem.
3669	Your sense that the commercial folks going to be OK with this approach?
3670	Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
3670	Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
3670	Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
3670	We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
3670	It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
3670	At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
3670	In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.
3670	We'll report back with information as we get it.
3670	Best, Jeff
3671	Dorothy has informed that CMTA will file solo.
3671	(Keith's got kids in expensive colleges, you know.)
3672	Great minds think alike.
3672	That is EXACTLY the opening line that Wanda and Michael and I came up with on a brief call this morning.
3672	Will do.
3673	As far as i know, we can get together tomorrow night.
3674	FYI.
3675	Will do.
3675	Did you folks have a call today?
3675	If you folks are going to have one every week, could we set up a standing time and call-in number?
3675	Be happy to participate on these and any other issues.
3675	Best, Jeff
3676	Perfect.
3676	Thanks.
3677	Feel free to send it along.
3677	But as you know, things are somewhat difficult these days.
3677	I'll get it to the right people, however.
3677	Best, Jeff
3678	It's hardball time.
3678	I'd be careful going up against UC/CSU, though.
3679	thanks very much.
3680	Thanks very much for all your help.
3680	Can I call you tomorrow morning to discuss?
3680	Best, Jeff PS Shapiro likes to kid.
3680	We're going to do everything we can in the meeting to try to settle this darn thing.
3681	Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis By Michael B. Marois Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said.
3681	The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2.
3681	His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay.
3681	The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m.
3681	San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said.
3681	Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise.
3681	Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy.
3681	PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April.
3681	The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan.
3681	The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.
3682	Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.
3682	My flight arrives on Southwest (from Oakland) at about 8 AM.
3682	I've rented a car.
3682	Then we can drive to Edison from there (it's about 30 minutes from the airport), east of Pasadena on 10.
3682	Then I can drive you back with me from Rosemead and you can catch a cab from Burbank to LAX.
3682	Should be pretty easy that way.
3682	Jeff
3683	Dan: Please add California Cast Metals Association to the list of signatories.
3683	Thanks.
3683	Jeff
3684	Dan: The chamber of commerce (because it never really plays at the PUC) has decided to sign on to CMTA's letter that it will submit, rather than sign on to the ARM filing.
3684	Please remove them from the list of signatories.
3684	Thanks.
3684	Best, Jeff
3685	On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect: The Politics of Power in California."
3685	I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned: A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."
3685	The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.
3685	The other roundtable-ists include: Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant? Anyone know what he's up to these days?) Bob Foster--Edison Nettie Hoge--head of TURN Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated) State Senator Debra Bowen Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated) Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.
3685	Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.
3685	All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.
3685	Best, Jeff
3686	Thanks.
3686	I'll call you in the afternoon.
3686	Jeff
3687	No problem here.
3687	That price is making DWR's contracts look worse and worse every day.
3687	Poor California.
3687	Jeff, if you have questions or want to discuss further, don't hesitate to call me or Sue, though Paul can likely answer most questions.
3687	Best, Jeff
3688	Did governor Jessie eliminate the role in Minnesota?
3688	I believe that it's the equivalent of a state historian.
3688	Thanks for the feedback.
3688	Best, Jeff
3689	In the constant state of "blur" I'm in, I somehow unintentionally left you off the note.
3689	Your comments/thoughts/feedback is of course greatly appreciated.
3689	Best, Jeff
3690	I'm around.
3690	Could you forward me the "matrix."
3690	(sounds so "classified." I love it.) Best, Jeff
3691	thank you.
3692	No problem.
3692	Thanks for the response.
3692	I understand the need to keep powder dry.
3692	Talked to Hertzberg this morning.
3692	The 3rd extraordinary ain't sounding like it's going to be a winner.
3692	Hope to talk soon.
3692	Best, Jeff
3693	SCE's problem is that no one except Davis and Edison are for the bailout.
3693	With respect to DA, only Burton's in the way.
3693	So Davis and Edison have the world against; and DA only has Burton against it.
3693	I'm at loss to determine which is worse off, which speaks to the craziness of the state of things.
3693	Best, Jeff
3694	Good idea.
3694	Thanks.
3694	Yes, I'm around.
3695	hey, prentice has a friend in town whom you may have met.
3695	very cool, very funny.
3695	we'd bring her along if that's ok, and if you still want to get together tonite, which we're totally up for.
3695	let me know.
3695	and it would be a good idea to get together since we should probably talk a bit about Jay's place.
3695	he's been inquiring about what we're thinking.
3695	best,
3696	let's do it at my place.
3696	is pauline's, salad and wine in order?
3697	Please consider this my response to your request to forward my schedule for next week.
3697	Your welcome in advance.
3697	annoyingly yours, thanks for the travel package.
3698	Check this out.
3698	I want to get any comments you might have before I sent it around.
3699	yes, you get pizza.
3699	we'll get the wine and greens.
3699	prentice LOVEs the fontina and garlic WITH mushrooms.
3699	see you at the Vahl-kay-knowwwww.
3700	FYI.
3700	We can discuss further on Monday.
3700	You may see something in the press about it.
3700	Best, Jeff
3701	FYI.
3702	My money's on Mirant/Reliant as the leak.
3703	Thanks and see you soon.
3703	Could you leave your phone number on my work voice mail.
3703	415.782.7822?
3703	Best, Jeff
3704	Consider me reminded.
3704	Thank you.
3705	Now that I've got your attention: Whatever you're doing, keep it up, baby!
3705	The stock's been moving up and up.
3705	Keep doing it, man.
3705	Best, Jeff
3706	Go Barry!
3707	Alice, whom I used to ride with and her guy Jeff (remember we went to their place in Petaluma some time back--chicken coups?) is getting married on Sunday, October 21 at 3 o'clock on Mare Island.
3707	You want to go?
3708	FYI.
3708	Long piece criticizing the Forbes' article criticizing Enron.
3708	Not bad.
3709	Really appreciate the note.
3709	Great working with you.
3709	Best, Jeff
3710	I love it.
3710	Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.
3710	If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.
3710	But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it.
3711	i.e., "sign up, or else."
3711	(I love it when you're tough.)
3712	you're b-day.
3712	if you guys would like to go there, that's just peachy with us.
3712	really.
3713	I'm hooting just thinking about it.
3713	Could we get someone else to do it?
3713	(Problem is just about everybody who could do it is in the soup because they're holding one of those stinking DWR contracts.)
3714	Thanks.
3714	You're call.
3714	Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance.
3714	Let me know what you think.
3714	Or, given the time crunch, just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--I also assume he'll spend his time 1) singing PA's praises and 2) claiming that DA can work, if done right, both of which are great messages.
3714	Best, Jeff
3715	I took a quick look.
3715	In short: --create regulatory asset out of the PX credit --collect on utility bills as dedicated rate component --silent on who should pay the charge.
3715	Best, Jeff
3716	Oh dear.
3716	Get a story straight?
3716	That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?
3716	Wednesday looks good for me.
3717	Jim/Rick/Steve: Talked to Fielder.
3717	Let me know when it's good to take 5 minutes to debrief.
3717	Thx,Jeff
3718	FYI.
3719	Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.
3719	Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
3719	Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
3719	In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
3719	In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.
3719	Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.
3719	However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17).
3719	We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
3719	Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.
3719	John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs.
3719	I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
3719	Some agreement on forebearance.
3719	I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.
3719	We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.
3719	The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.
3719	Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.
3719	While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.
3719	In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them.
3719	On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.
3719	Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.
3719	Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.
3719	Best, Jeff
3720	California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: "The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses."
3720	"We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal."
3720	"We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time."
3720	"Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives."
3720	The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores.
3720	Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually.
3721	Thanks very much.
3721	I faxed one the PUC filed against the Colton contract.
3722	Pure PG&E.
3722	They'll be talking to just about everyone and greasing palms to get more of the same.
3722	Can't wait to see who else jumps on the wagon.
3723	Horrible, unfortunately.
3723	He was the loudest, most articulate voice appearing before the PUC on the 20th, staunchly--and I mean staunchly--opposing DA.
3723	If I see him, I'm going to get all over him.
3723	But me thinks the contracts are in for a wild ride.
3724	Thanks very much.
3725	Doesn't look good.
3725	USA: Shares of NewPower plummet in midday trade.
3725	Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.

3726	Alan: Two things.
3726	1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.
3726	2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.
3726	Sure he'll be interested.
3726	Your call.
3726	Best, Jeff
3727	FYI.
3727	May be useful for Thursday's meeting.
3727	Best, Jeff
3728	In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.
3728	The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).
3728	Best, Jeff
3729	Call me.
3730	Thanks for coming by yesterday.
3730	Look forward to getting the deck up and hopefully working on many other projects in the future.
3730	Zip me a fax when you get the materials quote at 415.782.7854.

3731	Should you care, on Friday at the Hotel Monaco in SF, Law Seminars International is having a conference about electric restructuring in CA.
3731	The 8:30 AM panel is "status and implications of the PG&E Bankruptcy" with Jim Lopes and LInda Ekstrom.
3731	I'll be in Sacramento that day.
3731	Best, Jeff
3732	This looks very good.
3732	One suggestion: May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.
3732	May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).
3732	Just a suggestion.
3732	I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.
3732	Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.
3732	That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).
3732	Best, Jeff
3733	FYI.
3733	Big customers were hesitant to sign on to the ARM filing, but they were cajoled into filing on their own.
3733	They seem to hit the mark pretty well.
3733	Best, Jeff
3734	SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR The Bond Structure ?
3734	Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power purchase revenues and no other repayment source.
3734	?
3734	Designed as a "net revenue bond," meaning bondholders are paid last and all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.
3734	In order to sell net revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1) carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off the bonds.
3734	As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by ratepayers for 15 years.
3734	?
3734	Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs for the life of the bonds.
3734	?
3734	Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the bonds are outstanding.
3734	The Rate Agreement ?
3734	Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends over a revenue requirement.
3734	The Commission is limited only to correcting mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.
3734	If the Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates established at a level that satisfies DWR.
3734	?
3734	May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each service territory.
3734	?
3734	Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the requirements of a net revenue bond.
3734	Guarantees DWR receives whatever revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.
3734	?
3734	Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at the end of 2002.
3734	Already, the financial community has expressed concern about this provision.
3734	In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through Commission-approved revenue requirements.
3734	?
3734	Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the State.
3734	?
3734	Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term contracts entered into by the state.
3734	Because the existence of those contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.
3734	?
3734	The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.
3734	?
3734	Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.
3734	DWR will likely need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.
3734	Remains in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds are issued.
3734	The Challenges to the Rate Agreement ?
3734	Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.
3734	?
3734	Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State Treasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.
3734	?
3734	Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement, including: o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's revenue requirement o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law, and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR Oppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution networks.
3735	Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday.
3735	The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."
3735	Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."
3735	The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.
3736	FYI.
3736	Pretty good letter from large customers urging the PUC to vote down the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.
3736	With Loretta announcing today (and signaling to the Republicans on the Commission) that she'll be voting no on the rate agreement tomorrow, it looks like Davis and Angelides are in for a bad day.
3736	Sort of chokes you up.
3736	Best, Jeff
3737	What time on Wednesday?
3738	That's helpful.
3738	Thanks.
3738	Needed a time frame.
3738	Today's going to be very interesting.
3738	Should be able to get you something before 10; before noon, max.
3738	Best, Jeff
3739	Give a call when you get in. Let's discuss this further in prep for my follow-up call with Fielder tomorrow.
3739	Best, Jeff
3740	THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20.
3740	This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas.
3740	Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.
3740	Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day.
3740	She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers.
3740	Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced.
3740	When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris.
3740	Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry.
3740	She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.
3740	Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services.
3740	She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation.
3740	She will give the afternoon keynote address.
3740	Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982.
3740	From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch.
3740	Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000.
3740	She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
3740	Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops.
3740	Panels planned for this year's conference include: + Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate + Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World + International Business + Wild Women This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.
3740	For more information on the WIL conference, please visit .
3741	Did anyone else get the attachment?
3741	If not, Paul, could you resend?
3741	Thanks.
3742	could you give me a call when you've got 5 minutes.
3742	i have a very quick question.
3742	thanks a lot.
3742	Best, Jeff
3743	FYI.
3744	I'm real sorry to bug you with this, but you and I will need to do some research so that I can make sure that I'm reporting properly.
3744	Please stop by when you get a minute.
3744	Thanks very much.
3744	Jeff
3745	Do we have a boiled down version of the judge's proposed order in the PNW refund case?
3745	If we do, I'd like to start disseminating it liberally around California, and would also like to use it at this forum I'll be speaking at on Friday.
3745	Best, Jeff
3746	Hi Barry: Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions.
3746	We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened.
3746	I have a quick question: Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.
3746	Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.
3746	With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?
3746	We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.
3746	But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.
3746	If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.
3746	Thanks for your time and hope all is well.
3746	Best, Jeff
3747	Yank, yank, yank.
3747	Loretta's tubing Davis as we write.
3747	Chill, dude.
3748	You know, we could make a deal.
3748	I won't yank yours and you don't yank mine, but I know that you get so much enjoyment (and have experienced phenomenal success at) yanking mine that I don't think that's a good deal for you....
3749	Thanks very much.
3750	This will work for what I need to submit.
3750	FYI: I'm not going to get another person to help out on this, so I'm assuming that with me and the resources that I'll bring to bear, and with you folks and the resources that you'll devote, we'll be able to do an outstanding job of achieving the overall objective of taking a proactive regulatory stance in California.
3750	Best, Jeff
3751	PUC proceeding to consider continuing PG&E's "Gas Accord."
3751	The Gas Accord is PG&E's program to unbundle its backbone transmission and storage systems.
3751	The program began in 1998 and will expire Q4/2002.
3751	Though PG&E's system has been unbundled since 1998, SoCalGas' system remains bundled.

3754	Kisses, Jeff PS Last night Prentice made the most delicious porcini risotto from a veal stock that she and Cameron made!
3754	It was truly (no kidding) incredible.
3755	Jeez, Eldon is on fire.
3756	Why "not very?"
3757	In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
3757	The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
3757	Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.
3757	What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
3757	It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
3757	It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.
3757	What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
3757	With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
3757	The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
3757	It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
3757	Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
3757	In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
3757	Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.
3757	What Next?
3757	A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
3757	The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
3757	Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
3757	The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
3757	All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.
3757	The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
3757	Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
3757	Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.
3757	Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.
3757	If you have any questions, just let us know.
3757	Best, Jeff
3758	That's great.
3758	More the merrier.
3758	I assume you heard about what happened at the PUC today.
3758	I think it classfies as amazing.
3758	The planets may be favorably re-aligning just a little bit (one hopes).
3758	Best, Jeff

3762	there's a movie that Grisman's daughter did about Grisman and Jerry and bluegrass that opens at the embarcadero on wednesday.
3762	might be worth checking out.
3763	In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.
3763	This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."
3763	We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary: The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.
3763	Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
3763	Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
3763	Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
3763	Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
3763	Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
3763	Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
3763	Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
3763	The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.
3763	Best, Jeff
3764	PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.
3764	The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.
3764	The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: ?
3764	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.
3764	The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.
3764	The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.
3764	The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
3764	?
3764	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.
3764	If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.
3764	Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005.
3764	Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
3764	?
3764	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.
3764	Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
3764	?
3764	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt.
3764	?
3764	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.
3764	However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
3764	?
3764	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003.
3764	?
3764	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
3764	?
3764	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
3764	"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.
3764	"The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
3764	This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.
3764	Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.
3765	Assume for now at least that the currently allocation stands pat.
3765	Pretty crazy, huh?
3765	Gotta hand it to Loretta Lynch.
3765	Best, Jeff
3766	See email.
3766	PUC bailed out Edison today.
3766	No kidding.
3766	Jeff
3767	I have a copy of the settlement between the PUC and Edison if you want me to fax it to you.
3768	FYI.
3769	are you guys losing it about the edison settlement?
3769	seems better than 500KW and above, non?
3770	cool.
3770	thanks.
3771	come on, you're kidding, right?
3772	I'll be in the office very shortly.
3772	My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling: he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to "cooperate" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.
3772	He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.
3772	Michael: I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.
3772	Best, Jeff
3773	Thanks very much.
3774	Agreed.
3774	Karen, can you and I talk briefly before you call Ken?

3776	would you like me to participate?
3777	Just give me a call.
3777	you want to shoot for 10:30 my time?
3778	i'll be here.
3778	just give a call.
3779	have him call sue mara at 415.782.7802.
3780	Much happened yesterday--wow!--and at least for now, it appears that Loretta has let the Legislature off the hook--appears that the PUC is still a fairly potent institution.
3780	But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved.
3780	Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant.
3780	As such, we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 11:30.
3780	Best, Jeff
3781	No rush.
3781	Whenever it's convenient for you.
3781	Just let me know, and let me when you need the check and for how much.
3781	Kisses, Jeff Go Giants!
3781	Go Barry!
3781	PS Just wait'll next year!
3782	Got your message.

3783	If you want to go to the game,you should definitely go, since I'l likely be doing homework sunday night anyway.
3783	You should go.
3783	Should be a lot of fun.
3784	Prentice is working at google and i'm not sure that she gets email.
3784	try calling her on her cell phone.

3785	Thanks.
3785	Interesting.
3786	Thanks.
3786	I have to clear with Calger first.
3786	Also left a message with Kean re: same.
3786	May be that we give the idea to the large customers and they run with it so no fingerprints on our part.
3786	I'm going to sketch out a proposal and pass it around for people to swipe at.
3786	I'm for severing IF Riordan loses (you think he can win?).
3786	You going to the Astros/Giants game tonite.
3786	Hopefully they'll actually throw a strike to Bonds tonite.

3788	Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International.
3788	"We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters.
3788	"But we do not have a specific date."
3788	Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates.
3788	Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers.
3788	The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge.
3788	A ruling is expected by Thursday.
3788	Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed.
3788	"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said.
3788	"We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions.
3788	"We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way."
3788	Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt.
3788	Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately."
3788	"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said.
3788	"But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time."
3788	Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate.
3788	Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan.
3788	Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003.
3788	He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt.
3788	The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing.
3788	"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates.
3788	But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors.
3788	The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year.
3788	Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC.
3788	Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs.
3788	The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said.
3788	The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.
3789	Thank you Robert for pointing that out.
3789	I think there is/will be an opportunity--if we can ever get paid, and if we can ever comfortable from a credit standpoint--and my apologies for not having flagged that sooner.
3789	Too many balls.........in the air.
3789	Best, Jeff
3790	Don't hate me for sending a note.
3790	What do you think?
3790	"California made two big mistakes: First, they never made a market. They didn't deregulate. They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades. Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right. Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron. Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
3790	"Enron's the model of the virtual organization. Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem. That's what we did in California. Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well. What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company. That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."
3791	Attached is a draft agenda for tomorrow's meeting.
3791	If there's anything we've missed, we can amend the agenda prior to starting tomorrow.
3791	Best, Jeff
3792	Thanks very much for your help on this.
3793	Thanks a millino for your help.
3794	I can make it.
3795	Sue's will be in Houston for this, but will there be a call-in number to tap into for some of the discussion?
3795	Thanks a lot.
3795	Best, Jeff
3796	that would be great.
3797	Golf, please.
3797	Though the horses sounds very inviting!
3797	Thanks a bunch.
3797	Best, Jeff
3798	FYI.
3799	If you haven't heard, SoCal's announced their abandoning windows for OFOs.
3799	They're holding "workshops" on how it will all work soon.
3799	I'll get you the announcement.
3799	Best, Jeff
3800	Listening to the Edison call w/investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02.
3800	My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims.
3800	Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.
3801	Great.
3801	Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.
3801	You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?
3801	I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.
3801	I'm thinking that I may want to attend.
3801	Thanks.
3801	Best, Jeff
3802	Thanks.
3802	I guess Davis' people think that we'll back off if they put someone from Texas in charge.
3802	Perhaps they're looking for someone who knows Pat Wood.
3802	Be useful to find out if she knows him.
3802	Best, Jeff
3803	If you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January.
3803	You have thoughts on the Monday call?
3803	That one may not be as critical anymore.
3803	Best, Jeff
3804	Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets (Published Oct. 7, 2001) A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo.
3804	Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor.
3804	He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings.
3804	Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state.
3804	A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame.
3804	Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation.
3804	And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months.
3804	The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis.
3804	History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis.
3804	Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings.
3804	State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups.
3804	How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess.
3804	There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project.
3804	Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991.
3804	Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history.
3804	However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue.
3804	And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review.
3804	It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking.
3804	Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place.
3804	Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive.
3804	But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure.
3804	The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term.
3804	He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting.
3804	That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

3806	No problem.
3806	Thanks for the update.
3806	You know how to reach me when you've got it pulled together.
3806	Best, Jeff
3807	Is there any question?
3807	I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.
3807	As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.
3807	Best, Jeff
3808	We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.
3808	I can dig it up if you'd like.
3809	Sounds good.
3810	Please note name of venue.
3811	Did you get everything you need for the update?
3811	If not, don't hesitate to give me a call.
3811	Best, Jeff
3812	Thanks so much for the Storybook wine.
3812	Extremely sweet of you, and we really appreciate it.
3812	I gave Eldon the check for it.
3812	Man, did we get CREAMED in the pool.
3812	Sigh....
3812	Best, Jeff
3813	Just wanted to make sure that you have seen the announcement about the move, the meeting (on the 18th) they're having to explain and the brief description.
3813	If not, let me know and I'll fax it to you.
3813	And unless you have any objections, I'm seriously considering attending the meeting, since this has been one of the biggest problems we've had in the gas industry in California.
3813	Let me know.
3813	Best, Jeff
3814	Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.
3814	Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless Steve and Rick have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for Enron (even in California!).
3814	Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....
3814	Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.
3814	And holy moly, sounds like you and Christi are going to be extremely busy at FERC.
3814	Best, Jeff
3815	Thanks for the response.
3815	I think that I've got it cleared up.
3815	I'm assuming that the time for our case write is "the present," i.e., September 2001.
3815	If I've got that wrong, let me know.
3815	Best, Jeff
3816	I would have been happy to let you have it.
3816	You still can, you know.
3816	Just let me know (though we love to keep it).
3816	We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.
3816	But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.
3816	And what about those 9-ers?
3817	Greetings.
3817	Heard that Barry might in California this week?
3817	Someone mentioned there may be attempts to meet with DWR.
3817	Just checking, since DWR seems to be radioactive these days.
3817	Best, Jeff
3818	FYI.
3818	In case you hadn't heard, the " bailout" that Edison struck with the California PUC would allow Edison to spend up to $250MM "to hedge fuel cost risks associated with SCE's Utility Retained Generation and QF and interutility contracts."
3819	I would bet that we'll be there.
3819	I'll bring my check book.
3819	Is the 97 cab $32 retail?
3819	If it is, it's worth it.
3819	With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the cake.
3819	But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.
3819	We'll see you Sunday!
3819	Kisses, Jeff
3820	I apologize.
3820	My schedule went crazy.
3820	But I will have the update for you first thing in the morning.
3820	Promise.
3820	Best, Jeff
3821	Thanks.
3821	Boy, am I glad I've sat on that '94 cab.
3821	Wow!
3822	Jean: Pebble Beach sounds great.
3822	Let me know when you can fit it in your schedule.
3822	Give me a call when you have a minute and we can decide how to arrange a meeting.
3822	Greatly appreciate your help.
3822	Best, Jeff
3823	Elizabeth: Let me know it this works, or if you need anything else.
3823	Best, Jeff Fallout in California PG&E remains in bankruptcy The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California
3824	got message.

3825	Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
3825	When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers.
3825	All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather.
3825	When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly.
3825	They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis.
3825	Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act.
3825	But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly.
3825	At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge.
3825	It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position.
3825	Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways.
3825	The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval.
3825	And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases.
3825	Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment.
3825	One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member.
3825	And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad.
3825	A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis.
3825	That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation.
3825	Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain.
3825	By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment.
3825	He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party.
3825	He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again.
3825	Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well.
3825	The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade.
3825	Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake.
3825	If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging.
3825	Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.
3826	Power providers cry foul over fees State is accused of improper billing Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration.
3826	The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts.
3826	Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant.
3826	The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour.
3826	"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said.
3826	An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged.
3826	The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency.
3826	State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer.
3826	Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought.
3826	Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators.
3826	"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said.
3826	The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs.
3826	"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said.
3826	"It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."
3826	Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis.
3826	"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said.
3826	"They had one heck of a year."
3826	Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations.
3826	Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs.
3826	The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said.
3826	Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power.
3826	Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice.
3826	When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost.
3826	The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid.
3826	In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry.
3826	Davis appointed his own five-member board.
3826	In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor."
3826	The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization.
3826	Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.
3827	Dear Ms DSL: Looks like no DWR meeting this week.
3827	Thanks for the tip.
3827	Best, Jeff
3828	Oh, they're trying alright...but we have conflict with the consultant they've hired.
3828	I'll fill you in another time.
3828	(DWR is radioactive, though, and we shouldn't be doing any deals with them right now.)
3829	Rick: Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).
3829	It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
3829	Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
3829	Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
3829	Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.
3830	de nada
3831	See your email re: contract/DA fix.
3831	I'm in office.
3831	Jeff
3832	Mike Day and I talked.
3832	Mike agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.
3832	However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.
3832	In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.
3832	In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.
3832	If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.
3832	Best, Jeff
3833	yes.
3834	As things change, so do call schedules.
3834	We conferred and have recommend that: There will not be a call this week.
3834	Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
3834	Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.
3834	If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know.
3834	And please forward to others who need/would like to know.
3834	Best, Jeff
3835	Thanks very much.
3836	Only if you still agree to be surprised...
3837	Thanks.
3837	One other question, which seems like a legal question.
3837	Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.
3837	If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?
3837	I'm hoping that the answer is no.
3837	Thanks for the info.
3837	Best, Jeff
3838	got it.
3839	I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.
3839	In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.
3839	You have that proposal?
3839	And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.
3839	I can check on that.
3839	Best, Jeff
3840	knock 'em dead, buddy.
3840	jeff
3841	It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.
3841	Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering. And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot. Best, Jeff
3842	Hey, I haven't seen you at all and have been thinking about you.
3842	Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.
3842	Hope you are well and things are going swimmingly.
3842	Best, Jeff
3843	Hey, Jean.
3843	Man, who don't you know???
3843	Anyway, I'm sorry to bug you, but I'd like to try to get a meeting with Ms Doll ASAP.
3843	If there's anyway that we can manage that, I'd, of course, be eternally indebted.
3843	Best, Jeff
3844	Another defeat for Davis.
3844	Tough break.
3844	Is the judge's proposed decision available?
3844	Best, Jeff FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California .
3844	The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants.
3844	"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday.
3844	The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation.
3844	In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates.
3844	"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded.
3844	"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said.
3844	FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing.
3844	At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint.
3844	The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported.
3844	"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said.
3844	Contracting With Affiliates At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001.
3844	California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices.
3844	The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent.
3844	The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market.
3844	El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply.
3844	But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power."
3844	The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said.
3844	From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used.
3844	Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power.
3844	Improper Communications Seen Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse.
3844	Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another.
3844	The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers.
3844	Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion.
3844	Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding.
3844	But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted.
3844	Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules.
3844	El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling.
3844	The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said.
3844	The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings.
3844	The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings.
3844	However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.
3845	Thanks.

3857	California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said.
3857	The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates.
3857	The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts.
3857	Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis.
3857	``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall.
3857	There's got to be some give here.'' Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale.
3857	California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said.
3857	The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent.
3857	Davis `Willing to Discuss' ``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman.
3857	Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said.
3857	State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds.
3857	Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers.
3857	Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs.
3857	The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders.
3857	Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts.
3857	The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs.
3857	PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts.
3857	They also said the DWR has been given too much authority.
3857	In the past, the PUC has set utility rates.
3857	``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton.
3857	The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills.
3857	The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities.
3857	Davis opposes that plan.
3857	``It's dead on arrival.
3857	It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio.
3857	The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session.
3857	The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week.
3857	The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds.
3857	Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement.
3857	Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come.
3857	No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said.
3857	``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''
3858	keep up the good work!
3858	Sue's got it covered.
3858	But I'll be there soon enough.
3858	You know, I just received this note.
3858	Wonder if something's wrong with the network.
3858	Best, Jeff
3859	PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation.
3859	Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight.
3859	Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates.
3859	The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E.
3859	The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers.
3859	The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E.
3859	It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes.
3859	EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system.
3859	Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20.
3859	The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters.
3859	PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
3859	The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour.
3859	But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers.
3859	Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny.
3859	Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law.
3859	"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said.
3859	"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
3859	PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission.
3859	Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company.
3859	PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs.
3859	The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets.
3859	They point to the value of the hydro network.
3859	Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction.
3859	The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers.
3859	SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.
3860	Jean: We're on the job, trying to get the number.
3860	It's a little tricky, though (you know how newly-created bureaucracies can be).
3860	We'll get back to you soon as we have something.
3860	Best, Jeff
3861	Thanks very much.
3861	Really appreciate your help.
3862	Here's my take.
3862	Slash away at will.
3862	Sue, saw your notes, but didn't try to incorporate.
3862	You should add anything I've missed, got wrong, etc. Pulled it together quickly.
3862	Hope there aren't too many errors.
3862	And hope it helps.
3862	Best, Jeff
3863	In case Linda didn't forward.
3863	Best, Jeff
3864	I can be on.
3864	You want me to join?
3864	Just let me know.
3864	You can call me on my cell phone 415.505.6633.
3864	Best, Jeff
3865	Sounds like a good outcome.
3865	Thanks.
3865	Best, Jeff
3866	We did recommend using the DJ index.
3866	But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.
3866	Is that right Sue?
3866	However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.
3866	Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.
3866	I think that's how things currently stand.
3866	Best, Jeff
3867	FYI.
3867	Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.
3867	He's doing a story about the contracts.
3867	Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price. Now what?"
3867	I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions: No attribution to Enron specifically No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc. If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.
3867	We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc. More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."
3867	I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.
3867	I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).
3867	I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.
3867	He said he might get back to me.
3867	If he calls back, I'll let you know.
3867	Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below.
3867	Thanks.
3867	Best, Jeff

3868	Keep it up!

3871	FYI.
3871	Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said.
3871	The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman.
3871	"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said.
3871	No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts.
3871	The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts.
3871	The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts.
3871	Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company.
3871	Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said.
3871	As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said.
3871	California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.
3872	Davis devises new borrowing plan His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism.
3872	SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis.
3872	The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan.
3872	With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis.
3872	"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal.
3872	"There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."
3872	Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury.
3872	The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors.
3872	Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers.
3872	But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes.
3872	The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue.
3872	The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority.
3872	It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch.
3872	Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market.
3872	The plan now under review, however, would bypass that.
3872	The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy.
3872	Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street.
3872	The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes.
3872	Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates.
3872	"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said.
3872	"But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things."
3872	The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan.
3872	By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco.
3872	Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers.
3872	The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute.
3872	If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year.
3872	Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.
3873	What's your zip at home in Napa?
3874	Steve: the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.
3874	Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and Edison got.
3874	The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave.
3874	basis.
3874	If there's anything else you need, let me know.
3874	This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.
3874	Best, Jeff
3875	don't worry about it.
3875	i'm just sending the check now.
3875	whenever you get the wine is fine.
3875	and thanks again for doing it.
3876	Yes.
3876	And she handed out last time's mid-term.
3876	It was take home at that time, though.
3876	It's open book; we have the whole time, but she said it should take about 90 minutes (which means that it will take me the whole time).
3876	You want me to fax it to you?
3876	Check the website first.
3876	It may be posted there.
3877	I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
3877	Your a good lawyer; do you think he can end run the Legislature and the PUC and put the rate agreement in place?
3877	The plot continues to thicken, that's for sure.
3877	Best, Jeff
3878	Put who up for sale?
3878	Coastal?
3878	Really?
3878	Why?
3879	just faxed it.
3880	What's the date again?
3881	given the mess out here, and how long it's been going on, howzabout "deep therapy?"
3882	In case you hadn't seen it.
3883	clearly, the meeting with Horton et al went well...
3884	None, thank you.
3885	clearly, the meeting with Horton et al went well...And don't yank my chain (Kaufman, under stress, 10.01.01)
3886	deep six?
3887	Ms Denne, at Enron, we use the more polite form, "deep doo-doo."
3888	On a more serious note (notes).
3888	Sue's out sick today (caught something in Houston, it seems).
3888	And seriously, I hope the meeting went well.
3889	Boy, you are on fire today!
3889	Glad you think so highly of me????
3889	I give the goldfish two weeks...
3889	deep fried.
3890	We have any contract in the cross (short?) hairs?
3891	Oh, joy.
3891	Get out the mattresses.
3892	Luca Kaufman, who else?
3892	(What did you say the price was? The fact that it only goes to end of '02 is at least somewhat encouraging.) You know, I'm starting to feel like tom hanks in "you've got mail."
3892	guess that makes you meg ryan.
3893	yeah, that was him.
3893	beginning of the movie.
3893	they notified the corleone family with the message, "luca brazzie sleeps with the fishes."

3899	Best, Jeff
3900	Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.
3900	I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).
3900	I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.
3900	Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.
3900	Edison is the counterparty.
3900	Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.
3900	Best, Jeff
3901	Can you forward the decision regarding Davis' contract grab that came on the call the other day?
3901	Thanks.
3901	Jeff
3902	FYI.
3902	Put another call into Bloom.
3902	I'm sure he'll get back to me soon, but you know how busy these important lawyers are...
3902	Best, Jeff
3903	I'm getting my suntan lotion and heading down there....
3904	Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, comments, etc.?
3904	Best, Jeff
3905	Steve I haven't opened these, but let me know if this is the stuff.
3905	Jeff
3906	I'll have folks get those and forward them.
3906	Be back to you soon.
3906	Jeff
3907	I think that we should pursue both.
3907	If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.
3907	If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.
3907	Thoughts?
3908	Thank you.
3909	Hi Doug: Hope all is well.
3909	Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the PUC.
3909	Must be a relief.
3909	I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.
3909	You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?
3909	Change it?
3909	Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?
3909	Appreciate your insights.
3909	AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!
3909	What next?
3909	Best, Jeff
3910	Playboy Online staff cutbacks Playboy Enterprises plans to cut about a third of the jobs in its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal.
3910	As part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit.
3910	Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its service.
3910	"We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.
3911	Greetings: I'm the only one who hasn't left yet for the dome.
3911	If it's OK with you, I'd like to come by and pick up Annie.
3911	Likely get there around 7:30.
3911	That work for you?
3912	I thought you'd never ask.
3912	But, please, nothing special.
3912	You know me.
3912	I'm a Woodbridge kinda guy....
3913	Thanks for the reply.
3913	Agree the settlement is not nearly all that it could have been, but sure beats what we've got, it seems.
3913	If there's something you think that we can do to help in the GCIM case, please let me know.
3913	Best, Jeff
3914	Can't wait (smarty pants).

3914	Best, Jeff
3915	OK, dude.
3915	Now that I'm a full-fledged slacker, please tell me how much you need us to contribute for the weekend, which I'll add on to the $65 you paid for the guitar.
3915	If I'm missing any other expenses, please let me know and tack them on.
3915	It was alot of fun.
3915	Thanks so much for inviting us.
3915	Best, Jeff
3916	I said on this AM's call that today is the deadline for Davis to sign or veto bills.
3916	That was not entirely correct.
3916	That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills.
3916	The bill in question (SB18XX--Burton) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session.
3916	Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline.
3916	Davis has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides.
3916	We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session.
3916	Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.
3916	Best, Jeff
3917	It's safer there.
3918	Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.
3918	Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.
3918	Am I missing something?
3918	Thanks for the info.
3918	Best, Jeff
3919	Were you on call this morning?
3919	It was pretty interesting.
3919	If you weren't on, I'd like to discuss a couple of topics that came up.
3919	Best, Jeff
3920	That's fine.
3920	Not critical.
3920	Jeff
3921	Thanks.
3922	No problem.
3923	Greetings Ms Ryall: Wondering if you ever managed to get a hold of Ms Doll.
3923	No rush, no panic.
3923	Just want to keep the ball rolling.

3924	Thanks again.
3924	Best, Jeff
3925	Greetings: Could I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas Accord until 2005?
3925	You think they'll approve?
3925	When are comments due?
3925	We want to support you.
3925	Best, Jeff
3926	Yeah.
3926	Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in finance tomorrow nite.
3926	Sigh...
3926	Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.
3926	I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax.
3927	Sounds good.
3927	No rush, though.
3927	If she's not in till the 22nd, we have some time to plan.
3927	Best, Jeff
3928	John Wayne at his spookiest.
3928	4 stars.
3929	On another "food for thought" note.
3929	Eldon and Nancy: Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."
3929	Sort of thought-provoking.
3929	Best, Jeff Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."
3929	Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one.
3929	Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade.
3929	They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.
3929	Pacifism has never been exactly popular.
3929	But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force.
3929	Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective.
3929	Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.
3929	I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker.
3929	If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war.
3929	I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions.
3929	In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless.
3929	El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years.
3929	It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.
3929	But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans.
3929	In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones.
3929	I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism.
3929	About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.
3929	It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war.
3929	I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.
3929	Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.
3929	This is wrong.
3929	We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.
3929	In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country.
3929	The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world.
3929	They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism.
3929	They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism.
3929	The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."
3929	Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival.
3929	Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.
3929	In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.
3929	And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace?
3929	Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept?
3929	Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?
3929	Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness.
3929	Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy.
3929	Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler.
3929	Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.
3929	But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent.
3929	The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place.
3929	It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.
3929	Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes.
3929	Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways.
3929	And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible.
3929	It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.
3930	Wait.
3930	You mean that the first time you've seen John Wayne in a movie, or John Wayne being spooky?
3931	u aware of whalley meeting this pm re: settle SCE claims?
3931	jeff
3932	rent "true grit."
3932	very cool.
3932	I highly recommend--from a great coming-of-age girl's novel.
3932	also try "wake of the red witch."
3932	and, of course, "stagecoach."
3933	FYI.
3933	Some interesting tid-bits from CMTA.
3934	tribolet didn't know about it.
3934	might just be the "small" whalley group.
3934	I'll chk back with calger tomorrow am to see.
3934	jeff
3935	I'm still in for golf if you are.
3935	I'll bring some knitting in case you decide to bail...
3936	Talked at length with Mark Baldwin today.
3936	Could you give me a call when you get a chance to discuss?
3936	Thanks.
3936	Best, Jeff
3937	hey LOL: please tell leeeen that you're faxing it.
3937	thanks.
3938	Hi Jane: I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.
3938	Do you plan on attending?
3938	If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?
3938	Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.
3938	Best, Jeff
3939	Hi Glen: Two things.
3939	1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.
3939	Just let me know.
3939	2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?
3939	I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.
3939	I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.
3939	And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.
3939	Let me know if you plan to attend.
3939	If you don't, know sweat.
3939	Best, Jeff
3940	Hi Evie: Two quick things: 1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.
3940	There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app.
3940	for rehrng prepared).
3940	Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.
3940	Were you planning on doing anything?
3940	2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.
3940	Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
3940	Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.
3940	Best, Jeff
3941	thanks.
3942	check's in the mail.
3942	i made it an even $150.
3942	Let me know if that works.
3942	Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?
3942	Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.
3942	Should be interesting.
3942	We gotta dive again before the season's out.
3942	(If I can find the freakin' licenses. I'll start looking in earnest.) Yeah, we gotta finish the job.
3942	You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.
3942	Best, Jeff
3943	Forgive me.
3943	Can't recall if I already responded.
3943	Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.
3943	Best,
3944	Thanks very much.
3944	I was looking forward to meeting you as well.
3944	I plan on coming to Houston soon, and I'll look you up when I'm there.
3944	Best, Jeff
3945	Just give a call when you get a chance.
3945	I'm in. 415.782.7822.
3945	Best, Jeff
3946	Well, I guess my good friend Jerry's a little to busy these days.
3946	I'm going to contact another lawyer who represents some big QFs and then loop back with Jerry.
3946	Best, Jeff
3947	Sounds like a plan.
3948	The best I've ever had in my whole entire life, anywhere in the world.
3948	Seriously, I think the guests--including me--thought that it was fabulous.
3948	I know Prentice finished hers, so I assume she liked it.
3948	Cameron......well, you'll have to ask her.
3948	The mango chutney combined with the curry was, like, death raging, man.
3948	Best, Jeff
3949	Thanks, Evie.
3949	1) If someone writes a decent appeal, might you folks be interested in signing?
3949	2) Do you have Michael's # where I can reach him tomorrow.
3949	Sorry for the bother.
3949	And if you'd like to hear about what we're thinking about regarding QFs, be happy to share it with you as well.
3949	Be safe, Jeff
3950	Thanks.
3950	I think that's, well, a very aggressive view of how IOU debt and past and forward DWR costs are likely to be treated.
3950	Be happy to discuss further if you like.
3950	Best, Jeff
3951	Just let me know.
3952	left message for calger.
3952	will call when i hear back from him.
3952	jeff
3953	Missed the analyst call.
3953	What was your take?
3953	And you hearing that Lay's calling Edison today?
3953	Best, Jeff
3954	ditto.
3954	got a little choked up...
3954	best, Jeff
3955	Tribolet sez he doesn't know anything about the Lay/Edison call, but he said Wanda mentioned something about it.
3955	You may want to check in with her.
3955	I'm still waiting to hear from Calger.
3955	Best, Jeff
3956	did you hear that commerce1 announced today that it's laying off 50% of its people?
3956	sounds very ugly.
3956	but i guess that means less competition for you.
3956	best, Jeff
3957	Didn't see the release.
3957	They gonna be a softwary provider, or something?
3958	In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
3958	The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
3958	Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
3958	In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
3958	Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.
3958	Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
3958	The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.
3958	The precise language is cited below.
3958	If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.
3958	Best, Jeff "We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service. Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."
3958	pp 20-21
3959	Just a reminder: Beginning tomorrow, the (formerly twice-weekly) California call will now take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT/1:30 CDT), same call-in number.
3959	Until the next legislative session starts up in January, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento, unless something specific requires their participation.
3959	Best, Jeff
3960	thank you.
3961	Yes.
3961	September 20.
3962	FYI.
3962	Appears now that the option some customers have to put facilities to us is viewed as a negative.
3962	Best, Jeff
3963	great.
3963	see you at 4:30 today.
3964	Looks like Prentice and Nancy will be getting together in Napa to do a little bonding this weekend.
3964	Therefore, it looks like an opportunity to golf on Saturday or Sunday (screw football).
3964	Any takers?
3964	(Eldon has promised not to be the score Nazi.) Best, Jeff
3965	Folks: Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks feel about it generally.
3965	Hope all is well.
3965	Best, Jeff
3966	what stuff?
3967	I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.
3967	Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.
3967	I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.
3967	Best, Jeff
3968	1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt point capacity.
3968	P.44 2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity.
3968	P.45 3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
3968	This is the same cap that applies to SoCal.P.46 4)Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd.
3968	as a delivery/receipt at Ferc.
3968	5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels.
3968	Current level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs 6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share 7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers.P.62 8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.
3968	P.63 9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator.
3968	P.66 10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity.
3968	P. 75 11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD.
3968	Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements.
3968	The PD estimates an additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years.
3968	P. 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx.
3968	$ 44.4 Million.
3968	12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4 13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
3968	14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation .
3968	P 88-100.
3968	15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA.
3968	P. 103-110.
3969	Chris: A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday): A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
3969	After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1.
3969	(There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute. But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.
3969	In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC.
3969	In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us.
3969	In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.
3969	We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
3969	We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.
3969	(That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.) For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
3969	We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC.
3969	With respect to what else we could offer them: From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.
3969	But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
3969	One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.
3969	Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement.
3969	(But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.) Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
3969	One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.
3969	That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.
3969	This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
3969	The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.
3969	Hope this helps.
3969	Best, Jeff
3970	Cool.
3970	If $150 don't cut it on the check, just let me know.
3970	No sweat.
3970	EVERYTHING is confidential.
3971	We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.
3971	If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.
3971	Sound good?
3971	Best, Jeff
3972	Ridota's a tough customer.
3972	Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc. DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.
3972	May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.
3972	Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.
3973	Greetings.
3973	I can make it.
3973	Is there a specific topic/agenda?
3973	Best, Jeff
3974	Hi Rita: Not sure if I did this right.
3974	Was the idea to rank no more than 5, using 1-5, or more the way I did it.
3974	Just let me know.
3974	Best, Jeff
3975	Thanks.
3976	Any reason in particular that you're of this view?
3976	(I'm hoping you'll say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.)
3977	I like Saturday afternoon after your lesson, since we've got a wedding at 3 pm on Sunday to go to.
3978	that's what i was afraid of.
3978	i'll try again and resend.
3978	sorry about that.
3978	Best, Jeff
3979	I'll take care of it and if there's anything we need to do, I'll let you know.
3979	Best, Jeff
3980	You got it.
3980	You're right, distribution lists are a challenge.
3980	I'll make sure that you and these folks get on the list.
3980	Hope all finds you well.
3980	Best, Jeff
3981	Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.
3981	All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.
3981	We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week) It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
3981	If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
3981	Those that do call in will conduct the call.
3981	(Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.) Thoughts?
3981	Best, Jeff
3982	Hi Glen: Good call this AM.
3982	Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly.
3982	However, Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow, and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on.
3982	So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments.
3982	As soon as I get something from Mike Day, I'll forward to you so you folks can review.
3982	Best, Jeff
3983	DWR can meet with us on October 22nd.
3983	This work for you folks?
3983	Best, Jeff
3984	Hi Elyse: I work in government affairs in San Francisco.
3984	Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).
3984	The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.
3984	I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.
3984	Is that right?
3984	Thanks for the help.
3984	Best, Jeff
3985	Hi Hilda: I got an "out of office" reply from Elyse that mentions that you're the contact in her absense.
3985	Please see the note below.
3985	Best, Jeff
3986	Yes.
3987	FYI.
3988	FYI.
3988	Today, the PG&E Corporation Board of Directors elected Dede Hapner, currently Vice President -Regulatory Relations of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, as Vice President - Special Projects, for PG&E Corporation, effectively immediately.
3988	Dede will report to Steve Kline and will be located in the PG&E Corporation Washington D.C. office.
3988	Karen Tomcala, currently Director, Federal Governmental and Regulatory Relations of PG&E Corporation, was elected today by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Board to replace Dede.
3989	Might be able to do Sunday morning.
3989	Eldon's going to check and see if there's a tee time.
3989	Will report back as the news breaks.
3990	Thank very much Joseph.
3990	Alan and Sue, I'm comfortable canceling tomorrow's call unless either of you have a burning issue to discuss.
3990	We can start with the new arrangements beginning next Thursday, assuming that works for folks.
3990	Best, Jeff
3991	I think Sue should come down with something (I know I would).
3991	Horowitz?
3991	Eegads.
3991	He will be relentless...
3991	Looks like this group likes a good food fight.
3992	party pooper.
3992	(i understand. always more complicated than necessary.)
3993	CALIFORNIA PUC APPROVES PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY PLAN TO UPGRADE POWER SYSTEM IN TRI-VALLEY
3994	Interesting.
3994	Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."
3994	Question 2: How hot is it down there?
3994	Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer?
3995	My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).
3995	About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.
3995	I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.
3995	So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.
3995	That work?
3995	Best, Jeff
3996	Hi Rachel: John White asked me to contact you.
3996	He said you could email me a copy of the letter that you and Sarah are working on regarding Carl Wood's statements about green direct access.
3996	Is possible to get a copy emailed?
3996	Thanks very much for your help.
3996	Best, Jeff
3997	Great.
3997	Tom will get back to me to confirm that 11 AM works for him.
3997	I'll let you know.
3997	Best, Jeff
3998	FYI.
3998	QFs meeting with Edison today.
3998	Edison has not yet offered information on 1) date certain when QFs will be paid what they're owed, or 2) when the 5.37 cents will kick in. Best, Jeff
3999	apparently named by W himself as THE negotiator...
4000	Speech apparently was not quite as sharp as recent ones, but heard the event overall was very good.
4001	Based on yesterday's conversation, we've set up a call for 2 PM California time on Friday.
4001	Here's the call-in info.
4001	Best, Jeff
4002	Thanks very much.
4003	Tee hee.
4003	More questions to follow.
4003	Can't wait for the answers....
4004	interesting.
4004	thanks.
4005	FYI.
4005	Latest info is that large customers, some QF cogens, independent storage companies, and perhaps PG&E, will be filing separate comments supporting the Bilas decision to adopt the settlement.
4006	Mike Day's firm could do it, but they'll charge for the adminstrative costs necessary to file (we don't have the support necessary to file).
4006	Does that work?
4006	If so, I'll need to contact Mike promptly so they can get prepared to do the filing.
4006	No word yet as to whether SoCalGas will support.
4007	PS The cost of having Day's firm file for you folks wouldn't be more than $100-200.
4008	Lad: Sorry that I didn't respond.
4008	I'm travelling.
4008	Please call me on my cell phone 415.505.6633, or page me at 888.916.7184.
4008	I'll be available beginning about 6:45 AM tomorrow.
4008	Generally, there's going to be considerable support for the Bilas decision--at least from the lion's share of folks who made up the core of the settlement.
4008	Best, Jeff
4009	Thank you.
4010	Hey man, how goes it?
4010	Does this mean that you'll be supporting its adoption?
4010	Best, Jeff
4011	Man, makes California look like a second rate circus.
4011	You two are having all the fun.
4011	Surprisingly refreshing to hear that Massey put it to them.
4011	Best, Jeff PS I want you two to be the first to know I'm leaving.......
4012	You want to handle, or you want me to take a stab at it?
4013	Mike: Comments looks good.
4013	My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems.
4013	(From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?
4013	Very unlikely.
4013	But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.
4013	I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.
4013	That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.
4013	Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.
4013	Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?
4013	Best, Jeff
4014	Sam: Congratulations.
4014	But I've been informed that the buring chicken in the office kitchen ate up about 10% of the emission credits previously secured for the plant.

4014	Best, Jeff Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said.
4014	The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
4014	Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004.
4014	The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission.
4014	GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002.
4014	Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand.
4014	The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002.
4014	Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

4027	State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result.
4027	Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17.
4027	2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated.
4027	The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy.
4027	At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour.
4027	Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour.
4027	"Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources.
4027	"Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market."
4027	Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power.
4027	Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts.
4027	But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day.
4027	The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed.
4027	Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive.
4027	It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs.
4027	If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases.
4027	At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion.
4027	Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers.
4027	The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20.
4027	During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent.
4027	"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday.
4027	He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1.
4027	But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature.
4027	She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent.
4027	The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.
4028	Sorry.
4028	Haven't been around.
4028	I definitely want to move forward.
4028	I'll respond more fully if more is needed, but the short of it is, I'd like to do the entire job except for the decking.
4028	Ready to start when you are.
4028	Can you tell me what you expect the total to be (labor + materials), understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price.
4028	Also, I'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the "bridge" to the cabin?
4028	Will, of course, want the bridge to the cabin planked.
4028	If you have any questions, let me know.
4028	Really appreciate your efforts.
4028	Looking forward to getting started.
4028	Hope all finds you well.
4028	Best, Jeff
4029	Could be a soon as the next week or two.
4029	We'll make sure that you're up to date on the latest.
4029	Best, Jeff
4030	We'll continue to scour the universe for it.
4031	Forgive my ignorance, but I'm assuming that "related party transactions" refers to the Fastow deals?
4032	I THINK this is where I'll be this week.
4032	San Francisco: Mon-Thur Friday: Palm Springs at the conference I'm speaking at with EES
4033	Every Monday at 10:30 AM (Houston time), which is, more or less, a company-wide call.
4033	Every Wednesday at 1:30 PM (Houston time), which is a Government Affairs-only call.
4033	Those are it.
4033	If there's anything else, just let me know.
4033	Best, Jeff
4034	I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.
4034	If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.
4034	In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.
4034	Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."
4034	Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.
4034	The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.
4034	To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.
4034	She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.
4034	In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating: Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.
4034	Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
4034	Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc. Folks may have other points to make.
4034	Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.
4034	A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.
4034	Any thoughts?
4034	Best, Jeff
4035	I'll be on.
4036	FYI.
4036	Sure you've seen it, but just in case.

4036	SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at Enron By Stephen Taub The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions.
4036	"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a prepared statement.
4036	"We will cooperate fully with the SEC."
4036	Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.
4036	"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added.
4036	As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall Street Journal.
4036	The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
4036	REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial Times.
4036	Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year.
4036	In fiscal 2000, revenues climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year.
4036	The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the first half of this year.
4036	"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told the FT.
4036	Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year through August 31.
4036	Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar.
4036	The firm is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local currency terms, according to the paper.
4036	Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt covenant issues, and security concerns.
4036	"We're going to see more covenant violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

4037	If I've missed anyone who might be interested, please forward along.
4037	Best, Jeff CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS Friday, October 19, 2001 [1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts.
4037	Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18].
4037	[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies?
4037	The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1.
4037	The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6.
4037	Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines.
4037	Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation.
4037	Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority.
4037	Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures.
4037	Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output.
4037	California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority's siting plans.
4037	In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs.
4037	"The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need."
4037	Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market.
4037	"Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha.
4037	The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy.
4037	Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A.
4037	Savage].
4038	10-ish percent.
4039	FYI.
4039	Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better.
4039	Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.
4039	Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval.
4039	The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible.
4039	Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved.
4039	Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs.
4039	The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts.
4039	Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind.
4039	With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves?
4039	Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
4039	Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State.
4039	Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State.
4039	He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages.
4039	He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.
4039	Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento.
4039	Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.
4040	Prentice: The moral of the story: Don't, for god sakes, be a CFO.
4041	You get a hold of Bob Williams?
4042	Hey, I was wrong.
4042	I went back and checked.
4042	DA got as high as about 16% of total load in May 2000.
4042	On January 1 (contracry to Herr Angelides' letter), DA was about 7.3% of load.
4042	On February 1 it was 3.5%.
4042	Best, Jeff
4043	this is true.
4043	good point.
4044	FYI.
4044	Here's a note I sent to the large customers.
4044	Have spoken with them since.
4044	They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.
4044	Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.
4044	We're double checking to make sure.
4044	Best, Jeff
4045	congratulations.
4045	just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed!
4046	I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.
4046	We can hold off on that.
4046	In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.
4046	Best, Jeff
4047	Thanks for the cc.
4047	Nice touch.
4047	Chalk up another one for the good guys.
4047	Best, Jeff
4048	FYI.
4048	Please keep confidential and do not circulate.
4048	This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.
4048	Only the large customers will sign, however.
4048	I'll forward the final when they've completed it .
4048	Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.
4048	Best, Jeff
4049	Great question.
4049	If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.
4049	I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.
4049	Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.
4049	On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.
4049	In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue.
4049	Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.
4049	And that's just not the case.
4049	In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.
4049	But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.
4049	Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her.
4049	Could find that out in pretty short order.
4049	Best, Jeff
4050	CONFIDENTIAL.
4050	Please don't distribute.
4050	Evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to Loretta.
4050	I think it would be, but would be useful to have your/Loretta's views.
4050	Let me know.
4050	Best, Jeff
4051	I should be able to find out something by this afternoon, or tomorrow AM at the latest.
4051	I'll get back to you as soon as I hear something.
4051	Jeff
4052	Thank you.
4052	I would have said "governor turkey."
4053	give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.
4053	I'll find out which one works.
4053	when you leaving for NYC?
4053	the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).
4053	and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.
4053	just a thought.
4053	i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.
4053	best, Jeff
4054	Thanks very much for the update.
4055	can you email the most recent version of the QF buy-out presentation?
4055	I want to forward it to Tom Beach (consultant to CCC) prior to Wednesday.
4055	Thanks.
4055	Jeff
4056	Jeez, nice company.
4056	Putting you up for 10 days at the Waldorf.
4056	I love that neighborhood.
4056	Anywho, I'll check those dates and get back to you.
4057	Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).
4057	Question: Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?
4057	One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.
4057	Best, Jeff
4058	didn't listen to all of it, but sounds like they ain't making a heckuvalot of progress with edision on getting paid or getting the 5.37 cents put in place.
4059	Hi Brad: I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.
4059	They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.
4059	Either of those days work for you?
4059	If so, any time preference?
4059	Best, Jeff
4060	FYI.
4060	I ran into Bryson last Friday.
4060	He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.
4060	He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.
4060	He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.
4060	I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.
4060	He was pretty firm.
4060	He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it.
4060	Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?
4060	Best, Jeff
4061	Quck question: w.r.t.
4061	to the stipulation with Edison.
4061	1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?
4061	2) When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?
4061	Not sure if this matters whatsoever.
4061	But it might.
4061	Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?
4061	Best, Jeff
4062	Paul: Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.
4062	Here are some quick thoughts.
4062	Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.
4062	Be happy to discuss further.
4062	Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
4062	Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
4062	Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
4062	Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
4062	In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.
4062	It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
4062	When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
4062	Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
4062	And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
4062	Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.
4062	I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.
4062	Just let me know.
4062	Best, Jeff
4063	Greetings: Hope all's going well in your new venture (or semi-new venture at this point).
4063	You finishing this semester?
4063	Anyway, I was reading this press account and was wondering if you new this fellow when you were at Lehman.
4063	If so, any insights?
4063	Sort of an interesting career path.
4063	Say hi to your better half.
4063	Best, Jeff California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds.
4063	The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer.
4063	He will start in his new position in early November.
4063	The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity .
4063	Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations.
4063	Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service.
4063	He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds.
4063	Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission.
4063	From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority.
4063	He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985.
4063	He helped develop the authority's first conservation program.
4063	In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually.
4063	Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time.
4064	Tom: Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.
4064	If you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at 415.782.7822.
4064	What number should I call you at tomorrow?
4064	Best, Jeff
4065	at the all-employee meeting, someone just asked Lay if he was on crack.
4065	broke the place up.
4065	jeff
4066	Oh, great.
4066	Our next call will be from Steve Peace.
4067	thanks.
4068	Great questions.
4068	Some brief responses.
4068	We can discuss further tomorrow.
4069	Molly gets all her picks from "The Living Guide to Picking NFL Winners" by Martha Stewart.
4069	Note on p.
4069	12 of this months version: Martha shows how to make hanging planters out of the jock straps worn by the front line of the New England Patriots.
4070	Here it is.
4070	It's somewhat quick, but I don' t know what your timeline is (hopefully quick).
4070	Let me know what you think (hope you don't mind that I modified your title).
4070	Any word from Loretta re: whether a letter from big customers would help in the fight against tantrums from Angelides?
4070	Best, Jeff
4071	Greetings.
4071	In case Martin's interested...
4071	Best, Jeff
4072	Forget that, I'm expecting a new hanging planter for Christmas.
4072	(Tee hee).
4072	Kisses, Jeff
4073	Thanks.
4073	Sounds good.
4073	Did you say that you're living out in west Marin now (one of my favorite places and old stomping grounds)?
4073	I'm one of the many, the shameful, that's not finishing (though I'll only have one class in the Spring. Take care. Best, Jeff
4074	I'm reporting this obvious attempt at collusion and pool-fixing to the commissioner!
4074	Figures that the Commissioner's wife is in on it.
4074	(Isn't that always the way it is?)
4075	Well, not just any jock strap.
4075	Maybe you could model a few and I can pick one.
4075	Don't want it to clash with the furniture....
4076	Guess who?
4076	Me again.
4076	You thought about having your guy Jack (who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group) go to the Governor and tell him to tell Angelides to knock it off and to back off?
4076	Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?
4076	Third, I should be able to get you something on our view of RTOs.
4076	Best, Jeff
4077	dee-lish-ush dinner--the tart was especially yummy.
4077	thanks very much.
4077	by the way, was that a regular tart?
4078	FYI.
4078	Left him a message.
4078	Will report back when we hook up.
4078	Best, Jeff
4079	Thank you, O wise one.
4079	I'm sure that Jack will thank you for preserving his fluids.
4080	thanks.
4081	I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk.
4081	Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue.
4081	Here's what he said: They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
4081	Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
4081	He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).
4081	The numbers are illustrative only.
4081	In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.
4081	(Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.
4081	He agreed.
4081	He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
4081	Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
4081	It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.
4081	Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.
4081	We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.
4081	If you have any questions, let us know.
4081	Best, Jeff
4082	Apologies, don't know how in the heck I missed you on the list.
4082	(You know just clawing and backstabbing my way to the top.) Anywho, here's the note that I just sent.
4082	Let me know if there's anyone else that I embarassingly missed.
4082	Best, Jeff
4083	Dan: Is this also information that you'd like to be kept apprised of.
4083	Just let me know.
4083	Best, Jeff
4084	Wanda: I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.
4084	I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.
4084	Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?
4084	If you need another copy, let me know.
4084	Question: I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?
4084	Best, Jeff
4085	Thank you.
4085	Please let Michael know that we'll be coming in business casual attire.
4085	Hope that's OK.
4085	Best, Jeff
4086	FYI.
4087	Talked to Edison about getting a meeting with Craver.
4087	They're going to get back to me.
4087	Best, Jeff
4088	Edison did not bring up the refund issue at all (doesn't mean that they won't, though).
4088	Agree on the AB 1890 issue.
4088	The clock stops in March of '02.
4088	Best, Jeff
4089	Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?
4089	That's my biggest concern.
4089	Thoughts?
4090	Need to think about it a bit.
4090	Here's some of what we know based on the settlement: After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
4090	The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.
4091	Sorry I missed your call.
4091	Thanks very much.
4091	Wanted to make sure that I had the correct copies for release.
4091	Best, Jeff
4092	Here's what I'll do.
4092	I'll go back and look at the materials they sent us.
4092	Maybe you could do the same, so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our "contribution" is.
4092	Best, Jeff
4093	PS Ask me how tired of this bleeping issue I am.
4093	Hang in there.
4094	Under Angelides flawed reasoning, shouldn't energy efficiency be outlawed, since every kilowatt saved means less money to pay DWR for the contracts and the bonds to fill the hole in the state budget?
4094	Why pick on DA?
4094	Best, Jeff
4095	I asked Mike Day to make sure that we were kept in the distribution loop on this stuff.
4095	Best, Jeff
4096	Does Martha approve of aloe vera?
4097	I'll give you a call and fax you some materials that Edison uses to justify their position.
4097	Best, Jeff
4098	It's Baldwin.
4098	Let me know what dates you want to meet and I'll set it up.
4098	Best, Jeff
4099	I'll set it up.
4099	This Firday is not good.
4099	I'll shoot for Monday or Tuesday.
4099	DWR's in Sacramento.
4099	Mark is 50 miles east of SF in Livermore.
4099	Best, Jeff
4100	What's your fax number?
4101	thanks.
4101	it's on its way.
4101	i'll give you a call, or give me a call when you've had a chance to look at it.
4101	i'll include steve swain on the fax.
4102	Sounds good.
4103	Greetings: Thanks for talking the other day.
4103	Quick question.
4103	Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?
4103	Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?
4103	Or is there some proportionate sharing?
4103	And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?
4103	If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.
4103	Best, Jeff
4104	Talked to Pescetti yesterday.
4104	Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for.
4104	We had a good talk.
4104	I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.
4104	Best, Jeff
4105	Could you forward the gas daily article?
4105	Thanks.
4105	Jeff
4106	u still in DC?
4106	jeff
4107	Could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the California Ds gets a copy to me and Sue (want to keep the family happy, don't you know).
4107	Thanks a million.
4107	Boy do we need the cash from that merger.
4107	Please hurry.
4107	Best, Jeff
4108	You know what is more recently?
4108	Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).
4108	So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.
4108	Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.
4108	Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.
4108	I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss.
4108	In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?
4108	Might be a good idea to keep doing that.
4108	Best, Jeff
4109	Yes.
4109	I called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details.
4109	So he's up to speed; but feel free to forward.
4109	Best, Jeff Also, didn't want to put in the note, but I got the impression from Fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation.
4109	But I think we should push it, if for no other reason than to keep the PUC out of it.
4110	u get message from tribolet.
4110	re: px credit call at 4 pm (CDT)?
4110	jeff
4111	Thanks.
4111	Laurie: I'll assume that we'll meet at 7:45-8:00 at the front desk to coordinate a little bit?
4111	Best, Jeff
4112	You know, I ran into Martha once (literally) in Washington D.C.
4113	I like it.......you first.
4114	Hi Mark: Any chance of meeting with you and the gang from DWR on Monday morning or sometime Tuesday?
4114	Best, Jeff
4115	no.
4115	body to body.
4116	Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday.
4116	The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said.
4116	In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases.
4116	That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said.
4116	Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said.
4116	The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total.
4116	According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply.
4116	Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio.
4116	The rest is bought in the spot market.
4116	The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years.
4116	Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices.
4116	Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices.
4116	The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said.
4116	The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.
4117	Nice presentation.
4117	Look out Horowitz!!
4117	My suggestions are attached.
4117	Two other things: 1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it.
4117	There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
4117	2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S.
4117	Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."
4117	Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.
4117	Best, Jeff
4118	Those were Rick's and Steffe's.
4118	I was never sure where they came from and didn't use them, per se.
4118	We can talk more about it.
4119	Sue will take the lead on the ARM filing.
4119	Let's discuss further the idea of a separate Enron filing--pros and cons to each.
4119	Sue and Jeanne Bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable, but let's talk about it.
4119	Best, Jeff
4120	FYI.
4120	The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts.
4120	May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.
4120	There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.
4121	Didn't work.
4121	Was it in yesterday's gas daily?
4121	If so, I can access it.
4121	Thanks very much for your help.
4121	Best, Jeff
4122	Hey Suzie, what's up with that weather.
4122	And speaking of up, our stock's up today!!
4122	Keep your fingers crossed.
4122	Best, Jeff
4123	on phone with DWR trying to get a meeting for Tycholiz.
4123	will get on phone pronto.
4124	Thanks.
4125	you're such a kidder.
4126	bumpy times.
4126	gonna take alot of work to come back.
4126	i'll fill you in some time.
4127	talked to karen denne.
4127	she saw presentation and agrees.
4127	she's going to call sue.
4128	fyi.
4128	sue's at home.
4128	try her cell phone 415.902.4108.
4128	best, Jeff
4129	Sue's presentation.
4130	And here are my comments.
4131	FYI.
4132	got your message.
4132	one set of golf clubs--right-handed--is all that i'll need (well, that and about 100 golf lessons!).
4132	thanks for your help.
4132	Best, Jeff
4133	His name is Sean Steele.
4133	I'll have his number pronto.
4134	Oops.
4134	It's Shawn, not Sean.
4134	And here's what I got.
4134	Shawn Steele 323-951-9000 (law office) 818-841-5210 (Rep. Party HQ)
4135	Thank you.
4136	Sorry about that.
4136	I'll get back to you with some other dates.
4137	Jim: Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.
4137	Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.
4137	The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.
4137	In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.
4137	Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?
4137	Best, Jeff
4138	Thanks very much.
4138	I'll try to subscribe again.
4138	Hey, forgive me for being a snoop, but do you not wear glasses at all anymore?
4138	Signed, Four eyes
4139	I thought that might be the case.
4139	Didn't want to be so bold as to bring it up, though.
4139	You looked great with glasses.
4139	You look great without them.
4139	Thanks again for the email.
4139	Best, Jeff
4140	Hey, I can't find steve kelly's email.
4140	can you forward this to him?
4141	I'm not interested.
4141	But is it more, or less, than you described?
4142	which game is it?
4143	you're fired.
4144	Seems like something IEP would certaintly be way out in front on.
4144	After suppliers' last experience with the PUC's planning process, seems like they'd aggressively go after its return in a very big way.
4145	Trying again.
4145	Best, Jeff
4146	Prentice will call you.
4147	The generators are going to go nuts over this.
4147	They'll do all the pounding needed on their own.
4147	Calpine will likely lead the charge, which should be interesting....
4148	How do the 13th or 20th of November work?
4149	Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.
4149	But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.
4149	I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.
4149	Followed up with Fielder this morning.
4149	He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.
4149	He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.
4149	If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.
4149	I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.
4149	That work?
4149	Best, Jeff
4150	I'll contact Lydia and you'll have materials well in advance of the meeting.
4151	Hi Lydia: Could you let me know what time in the afternoon of November 13th works with Brad's schedule?
4151	Will need 60 minutes.
4151	Thanks very much for your help.
4151	Best, Jeff
4152	It's going to be sometime in the afternoon on the 13th.
4153	Nice job.
4153	In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision?
4153	Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.
4153	Shouldn't DWR and its rev.
4153	req.
4153	be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.
4153	Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.
4153	Best, Jeff
4154	Baldwin's secretary called.
4154	He's going to check with DWR and get back to me tomorrow morning regarding whether Monday or Tuesday will work.
4154	Best, Jeff
4155	Greetings: Unlucky you.
4155	It's me again, calling about setting up a meeting with Ms Doll.
4155	Any word?
4155	Greatly appreciate your efforts.
4155	Best, Jeff
4156	No problem.
4156	No hurry.
4156	Whenever you've got it ready is great.
4156	Best, Jeff
4157	Jim: Thanks for getting people together.
4157	There are (at least) 3 things going on here: 2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday? sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
4157	3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.
4157	2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.
4157	It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.
4157	No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.
4157	We have a number yet for the call?
4157	Best, Jeff
4158	Hi Bob: Could you please leave on my voicemail the call-in number to discuss the meet and confer call that's happening with Edison?
4158	When exactly is that meeting?
4158	Is it California or Houston.
4158	Thanks very much.
4158	Best, Jeff
4159	Let's try this.
4159	It's all inter-related.
4159	PG&E, the prehearing conference and our workout with Edison.
4159	Can we have one call that you includes all who need to be involved?
4159	(I'm thinking, Steffes, you, Tribolet, me. Mellencamp, Wanda, Sue).
4159	That make sense?
4159	Let me know.
4159	Easiest thing would likely be to set up a call-in number (I'm mobile today).
4159	Thanks alot.
4159	Best, Jeff
4160	Hi.
4160	You guys gloating over the fact that the Yankees are getting CRUSHED by the D-Backs?
4160	Hope you're both well.
4160	Best, Jeff
4161	FYI.
4161	In case you'd like to listen in on what the IOUs have to say about the current and future fate of the PX Credit.
4161	Best, Jeff
4162	There is currently a meeting set for this Thursday at 11 AM (PST) at Edison headquarters in Rosemead.
4162	Best, Jeff
4163	Craver, Edison's CEO, is traveling and won't be back in the office until Wednesday.
4163	I'm trying to arrange something with his office.
4163	Might need to take two cars if you've got other meetings set up.
4163	I'll give you a call to discuss.
4163	Jeff
4164	The pleasure was all mine.
4164	You did a fantastic job with the presentation (both developing and presenting it).
4164	Likewise, it lifted my spirits in these challenging times to meet someone as talented (and fun!) as you.
4164	Hope our paths cross again often.
4164	Never hesitate to get in touch if there's anything I can do.
4164	Best, Jeff
4165	Thanks to all of you for your help with this.
4165	Made my participation practically effortless, and more important, alot of fun.
4165	Great job.
4165	Best, Jeff
4166	Actually, I'm travelling tomorrow.
4166	If we could do it between 8 and 9:30 AM (PST), that would work.
4166	Otherwise, I'll need to do Wednesday if possible.
4166	Best, Jeff
4167	Horowitz never had a chance.
4168	Really appreciate it.
4168	Will you be attending?
4169	Great.
4169	Just to make sure.
4169	I've got an address of 3310 El Camino, Suite 120.
4169	This correct?
4169	Is there a number there in case something comes up?
4169	Best, Jeff
4170	3310 El Camino (Sacramento).
4170	Suite 120.
4171	Just sent you yahoo map/directions on how to get to DWR.
4172	Hi Cynthia: I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
4172	I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday, Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM (want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is where I always rent). Is this something that you folks generally arrange, or do I just do it? Is there a corporate account # I'll need if I do it? Really appreciate your help. Best, Jeff
4173	Hey, I've got a "devil" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from becoming "hellish."
4173	Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?
4173	I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc.
4174	Greetings: The Commission denied it.
4174	Work is underway to appeal the Commission's decision to the courts.
4174	Sue Mara is taking the lead on this for us.
4174	She can update you on where the appeal stands.
4174	Be great to get you support for/participation in the appeal.
4174	Best, Jeff
4175	Sounds good.
4175	My cell phone number is 415.505.6633.
4175	Jeff
4176	Can we have chat again between now and COB Wednesday (like we did night before PG&E meeting) to get ourselves in order for the Edison meeting?
4177	Obviously worth the time.
4177	Great letter.
4177	Thanks for sharing...
4177	Best, Jeff You folks gearing up to respond to Karl Woods questions regarding why the suspension should be pushed back to July 1?
4178	You folks giving this to the press?
4178	Might be useful.
4179	You won't believe this.
4179	Jerry Bloom left me a message.
4179	Wants to talk, though I wouldn't get my hopes up.
4179	I'll let you know what he says.
4179	Best, Jeff
4180	You have time to talk a bit more about what we were discussing on the call?
4180	In particular, impact on the book of negotations around the PX credit calc going foward?
4180	Jeff
4181	I have a 3.
4181	I'll call at 4.
4182	Thanks so much.
4182	Really appreciate it.
4182	Best, Jeff
4183	Thanks.
4183	See you at 10.
4184	FYI.
4184	Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to "dignify" his letter.
4184	They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in charge, and addressed it to her.
4184	Had a great talk with Sarah.
4184	She's following up on a few things.
4184	You may want to touch base with her re: hearings on DWR rev.
4184	req.
4184	You ever received my (modest) edits to the Karl Wood letter?
4184	Best, Jeff PS Is that article you sent me re: bad contracts from today's papers?
4185	Does this mean I shouldn't have talked to the Journal regarding my views of merger?
4185	Ooops.
4185	I'll refer inquiries to you from now on....
4185	Seriously, hope (given the circumstances) that all finds you well.
4185	Best, Jeff
4186	With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that: Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
4186	Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
4186	Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.
4186	We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.
4186	Best, Jeff
4187	Couple of additional pieces of information: In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
4187	It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).
4187	So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
4187	Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
4187	Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.
4187	Best, Jeff
4188	Fielder's traveling today.
4188	Left him a long message on his voicemail and asked him to get back to me as soon as he gets a chance.
4188	Best, Jeff
4189	Steve: Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.
4189	You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you.
4189	As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.
4189	You can count on that.
4189	(Now if we can just find something left to turn around. Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.
4189	Please give my regards to Ken.
4189	Best, Jeff
4190	I'm only coming if Molly comes as Martha.
4191	thank you.
4192	The call was pretty tough.
4192	Quick side bar: Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
4192	At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it.
4192	As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
4192	Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
4192	In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
4192	Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
4192	We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.
4192	I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
4192	Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
4192	Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
4192	We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.
4192	If you have any questions between now and then, give a holler.
4192	Best, Jeff
4193	FYI.
4193	Martin may be interested.
4193	Best, Jeff
4194	Well, we had the right person handling the call, that's for sure.
4194	Best, Jeff
4195	Looks good.
4196	Under the circumstances, I am leaning toward cancelling (I was originally only going to participate on Monday anyway, and Sue hadn't planned on attending. Neither Rick nor Jim can attend.) If there's a compelling reason that you think I should attend, let me know.
4196	Otherwise I'll let Bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one.
4196	Best, Jeff
4197	Greetings Severin: No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).
4197	However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.
4197	I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.
4197	Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas.
4197	Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.
4197	She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.
4197	Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.
4197	On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.
4197	You and Sweeney did a great job.
4197	What was your impression?
4197	I've noticed that it got some decent press.
4197	Best, Jeff
4198	It was good to see you.
4198	No thanks needed.
4198	I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.
4198	How'd the meeting with PG&E go?
4198	You get back to Houston OK?
4198	Best, Jeff
4199	I'll get back to you on teh plants as soon as I can.
4199	Best, Jeff
4200	FYI.
4201	Groovy.
4202	what's the name of the borenstein consulting firm that you're applying too?
4203	Professor: Thanks for the response.
4203	However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.
4203	Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.
4203	My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.
4203	You'll note that this copy is dated "1031," whereas the previous copy was dated "1029."
4203	Best, Jeff
4204	Best of luck.
4204	Stay in touch.
4204	You thinking of working in France?
4205	PLEASE do not overreact, but I want you to have this information.
4205	Hang in there everyone.
4205	Jeff
4206	FYI.
4207	Hey, how ya doing?
4208	Thanks, ain't going near it.
4208	How's things going out there on your end--settling down at all?
4208	Best, Jeff
4209	Got the fax.
4209	Thank you.
4210	I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.
4210	As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.
4210	Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.
4210	Thoughts?
4210	Best, Jeff
4211	I'm not positive.
4211	The best way to find out is to call the Public Advisor at the PUC directly.
4211	He'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers.
4211	And I'm sure it's very easy to do.
4211	I'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the Wednesday calls, though they've really wound down alot since the Legislature took off for vacation.
4211	Hope all is well.
4211	Best to you and yours, Jeff
4212	Good plan.
4213	Thanks.
4213	Anyone there you would recommend as a point of contact/entry?
4213	Best, Jeff
4214	Got your message.
4214	As soon as I get a hold of Williams--not sure where he is--we'll have the call.
4214	Hopefully we can do it within the next 30 minutes or so.
4214	That work for you?
4214	And when it happens, I can conference folks in using my phone.
4214	What's your direct dial.
4214	Best, Jeff P.S.
4214	Sanity is a good thing.
4215	Thanks.
4215	Talk to you soon.
4216	Thanks very much for helping Aida.
4217	Bob's secretary called to tell me that Bob's at a doctor's appt and will be back in the office around noon Houston time.
4217	We'll shoot for around noon CST to have the call.
4217	I'll conference folks in from my phone.
4217	Best, Jeff
4218	We need to start figuring out as soon as possible: What we want to accomplish at the hearing.
4218	What our posture/message will be.
4218	What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond.
4218	What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond.
4218	How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference.
4218	How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations) Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.
4218	Please let me know if this works for everyone.
4218	Thanks a bunch.
4218	Best, Jeff
4219	Thanks.
4219	That's why I was calling.
4219	I'll continue to work to set up.
4219	Any particular time, day, etc.?
4220	Also, GWF is a QF developper from back in the days when QFs roamed the earth.
4220	Rather small player at that as best as we can tell.
4221	USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.
4221	NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said.
4221	But there's a catch.
4221	While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer.
4221	According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices.
4221	Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources.
4221	"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study.
4221	Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
4221	Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories.
4221	The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products.
4221	"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study.
4221	CALIFORNIA CAVEAT Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California .
4221	But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims.
4221	"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner.
4221	More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized.
4221	Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States.
4221	Hydropower provides about 10 percent.
4221	With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade.
4221	National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel.

4222	Hey, you guys having fun yet?
4222	Did you watch the game last night?
4222	The Yankees are awesome--Eldon's been submitted to the loony bin.
4222	Best, Jeff
4223	Yesterday, we discussed that Edison is likely going to try to jerk around ESPs, QFs and generators on past due amounts under its settlement with the PUC.
4223	Here's the latest on what they're doing to the QFs.
4223	Best, Jeff
4224	OK.
4225	?
4225	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
4225	?
4225	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.
4225	This is it in a nutshell: 1.
4225	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 2.
4225	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3.
4225	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection.
4225	4.
4225	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.
4225	Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
4225	5.
4225	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
4225	?
4225	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other options.
4225	?
4225	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
4225	?
4225	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
4225	?
4225	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and comment on.
4225	?
4225	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of which is low).
4225	If you have any questions, let us know.
4225	Best, Jeff
4226	Greetings Ms Kahl: Few things: 1) No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
4226	2) Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
4226	3) Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t.
4226	how it intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.
4226	In short, all DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.
4226	Which means DA customers would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.
4226	Is this something that your clients care about?
4226	We care quite a bit.
4226	One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.
4226	We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.
4226	One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.
4226	You have a view on whether hearings are required?
4226	More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?
4226	Inquiring minds want to know.
4226	Hope you're well.
4226	Please don't travel over any bridges.
4226	Best, Jeff
4227	Still working on the large customers...Will let you know (but don't hold your breath).
4228	yes.
4229	Greetings Janelle: Got your message.
4229	I will call you first think Monday to discuss.

4231	Hope the trip to SF went well.
4232	Well, it was too brief, and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped.
4232	But when I did, it was very enjoyable.
4232	All the best.
4232	These are strange and unsettling days, but it seems that the best among us always land on their feet, so I'm sure that's where you'll end up.
4232	Take care and hope to cross paths again soon.
4232	Best, Jeff
4233	It was good to see you.
4233	Glad you had a good time.
4234	Does it make sense to have a quick call (15-30 minutes) just to update you on the status of Edison/PG&E talks, what's going on at the PUC, etc.?
4234	Let me know.
4234	Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it.
4234	Best, Jeff
4235	Talked to Craver's office.
4235	His office is going to get back to me about meeting at Edison early next week.
4235	That work for you?
4235	Best, Jeff
4236	We continue to trade voicemails.
4236	One of these times, we'll catch each other.
4236	I'll report back just as soon as we do.
4236	Best, Jeff
4237	will do.
4238	O boy, I feel another planting binge coming on!
4238	Hey, we're likely going to the Dome this weekend, so you're likely going to have put with seeing us.
4238	Could you believe that game last night--got to be one of the best world series ever.
4239	Traded calls.
4239	I'll get back to you soon as we hook up.
4239	Can't wait to hear what Jerry says.
4239	Probably something like, "Talked to Tom Beach. Heard about your plan. We'll call you."
4239	Or who knows.
4239	He could surprise us.
4239	I'll let you know either way.
4239	Best, Jeff
4240	We're currently scheduled to follow-up with Edison at Noon CST (10 AM PST) on Thursday, Nov. 8th.
4240	We'll set up a number and distribute to folks.
4240	Best, Jeff
4241	Thanks for your efforts, thanks for trying, and thanks for your strong sense of decency.
4241	If there's anything whatsoever I can do to assist, don't hesitate.
4241	Best, Jeff
4242	Ah ha.
4242	Now I see why you were asking.
4242	So sorry that you "have to visit" Maui.
4242	Tough break.
4243	Thanks a million.
4244	thanks.
4245	FYI.
4246	eeegads.
4246	you heard about the story circulating that skilling attended a "high society" pajama party last weekend in houston.
4246	eeks.
4247	Interesting thanks.
4247	Any word on the transcript?
4248	Could you forward Dan's draft.
4248	While Aaron's points are good ones, I think may tipping at windmills...
4249	you'd think he'd go abroad on vacation or something until things cooled down, non?
4250	Thanks, Jeanne.
4250	Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).
4250	Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.
4250	This takes a much narrower approach.
4250	Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.
4250	I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.
4250	Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.
4250	Thanks again.
4250	Best, Jeff
4251	Greetings: Any chance of changing my lesson from tomorrow to this Friday (preferably about lunchtime)?
4251	Let me know.
4251	If you're all booked for Friday, I'm likely going to have to skip this week.
4251	Let me know.
4251	Hope all is well.
4251	Best, Jeff
4252	FYI.
4252	I've talked to Jeanne, and she and Mike may have not completely communicated on this.
4252	Given the uncertainty, I'm having to hold off on sending a note around.
4252	I'll do one after the call.
4252	Best, Jeff
4253	Thanks for the note.
4253	Just let me know.
4253	We'll do it when you're ready.
4253	Between now and then, could you send me a summary (understanding that it's an estimate) of time and materials as you see them.
4253	Thanks again.
4253	Good luck with the other jobs.
4253	Talk to you soon.
4253	Best, Jeff
4254	Great.
4254	Can you give me the entire list (indicating who's who)?
4254	I'm thinking that if I let the big customers know, perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on.
4255	Couple thoughts.
4255	Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.
4255	Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
4255	Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
4255	It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
4255	In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
4255	But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).
4255	But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.
4255	Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.
4255	We can take it or leave it.
4255	Best, Jeff
4256	In California, all customers can choose--large and small.
4256	There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).
4256	Consumption volume differentiates the two.
4256	Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.
4256	There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.
4256	And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.
4256	If there's anything else, let me know.
4256	Best, Jeff
4257	What came of the call?
4258	You get in to see Whalley?
4259	Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.
4259	Ain't getting any prettier.
4260	you get in to see whalley?
4261	You're kidding, right?
4261	Edison's at about 14.50.
4262	great.
4262	good luck with others.
4263	When do you want to call Hedy and Bev?
4264	$18.10/share.
4264	don't make me give suggestions.
4265	aye aye.
4266	thanks.
4266	I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.
4266	You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?
4266	And that Buffet ain't interested?
4266	What a world.
4266	Someone in real estate finance I know compared what Fastow & Co. did to the FirstPlus fiasco.
4266	That hurt.
4266	Best, Jeff
4267	Quick adder: It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.
4267	Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.
4268	No problem.
4268	To be honest, I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally.
4268	Please let me know if I do/did.
4268	Also, keep in touch with how the issues go with them, since they are clearly trying to use the reg.
4268	issues as leverage, and in that regard, often offering up worst-case scenarios.
4268	Best, Jeff
4269	I'll get back to you today.
4269	Houston is dealing with some pretty big issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.
4269	How's the weather in the big apple?
4269	You vote for Green or Bloomberg?
4270	OK, today's been nuts.
4270	This is likely not complete, but wanted to get something around.
4270	Please review for 1) anything I've missed and/or 2) anything I've misstated.
4270	Thanks.
4270	Best, Jeff
4271	plz see email re: talking points.
4271	jeff
4272	Jesus, 93 million Enron shares have traded thus far today.
4272	Insane.
4273	Brad: Lot of water under the bridge since the 25th, but I just got a note from Perfect.
4273	They're still planning on being in Houston to meet on the afternoon of the 13th.
4273	Let me know if anything's changed and I'll get you the information on Perfect ASAP.
4273	Thanks.
4273	Best, Jeff
4274	No problem.
4274	I'll let them know.
4274	Best, Jeff
4275	Hey: Just heard back from Brad.
4275	He's not cancelling.
4275	Just post-poning.
4275	Lots--and I mean lots--going on.
4275	I think that, realistically, we're talking December.
4275	Sorry about that, but you know how quickly things can change....You guys hang out with the McCourey's at all?
4275	Kisses, Jeff
4276	Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know: The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
4276	With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.
4276	The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
4276	A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
4276	There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
4276	The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
4276	The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
4276	In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
4276	At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
4276	Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either.
4276	(Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.) The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
4276	Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.
4276	Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.
4276	Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
4276	Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.
4276	The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.
4276	As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
4276	The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc. From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.
4276	In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."
4277	interesting to say the least.
4277	great case for b-school.
4277	you still in texas?
4278	No new details to report.
4278	Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.
4278	On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.
4278	Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.
4278	Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.
4278	Best, Jeff
4279	Greetings folks.
4279	The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.
4279	They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.
4279	(DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.
4279	Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.
4279	Thanks a bunch.
4279	Best, Jeff
4280	You bet.
4281	April: Could you please distribute this to the office?
4281	Thanks a bunch.
4281	Greetings Folks: Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?
4281	Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.
4281	I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline.
4281	(My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football) They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.
4281	I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.
4281	Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.
4281	If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.
4281	Best, Jeff
4282	Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.
4282	He focused squarely on energy.
4282	He made three key, and interesting points.
4282	The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.
4282	If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority.
4282	If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.
4282	I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.
4282	Best, Jeff
4283	Hey, buddie.
4283	Mike and Sue still differ.
4283	We're getting the transcript to verify.
4283	I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.
4283	They both agreed.
4283	Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in. Let me know if this works for you.
4283	(Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.) Best, Jeff
4284	They're yours.
4284	Just let me know as soon as you can if you'd like them.
4284	Hope you're doing well.
4284	Stay buckled up.
4284	It's bumpy out there.
4284	But at least they're starting to publicly clean house.
4284	Best, Jeff
4285	Haven't seen any DA statements yet.
4286	this sunday.
4287	they're yours!
4287	and, it comes with a new car!
4287	and a case of turtle wax!
4288	FYI.
4289	oh joy.
4290	Understanding that many things can change dramatically between now and next Thursday, we are nonetheless scheduled to call Jim Scilacci at 4 PM CST on Thursday, November 15th.
4290	Best, Jeff
4291	Josh.
4291	Been in a meeting all morning.
4291	Think I missed the bidding.
4291	If I can't get in, here are my bids: E280--Real Estate & Urban Land: 500 pts E286--Global Strategy: 500 pts If this won't work, just let me know.
4291	Sorry for any mixup.
4291	Best, Jeff
4292	FYI.
4293	FYI.
4294	As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison.
4294	Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
4294	The call was short and ended with an agreement that: 1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will be made, and 3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.
4294	If anyone has any questions, just let us know.
4294	Best, Jeff
4295	Rick: It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.
4295	Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.
4295	Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.
4295	And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.
4295	Thanks again for your efforts.
4295	Talk to you soon.
4295	Keep hanging in there.
4295	Best, Jeff
4296	No. what do they do?
4297	great time.
4297	SO sorry I passed out.
4297	Man, I just suddently hit the wall.
4297	On the Jay thing.
4297	There's no pressure at all.
4297	If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.
4297	Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.
4297	Most importantly in the near term.
4297	Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?
4297	Just let me know.
4297	And again, let's keep this light.
4297	No frictions.
4297	Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc. Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.
4297	Keep your taht moh rising.
4298	FYI.
4299	what's pepcid.
4299	he has NO idea.
4299	is he sure it ain't something fatal?
4299	poor annie.
4300	Hi Josh: Sorry to bother you.
4300	But just wanted to be certain.
4300	By my tally, I only need to take 3 units next semester (spring) to graduate (I'm taking 7 units this semester).
4300	Is there anyway to get that "officially" verified through the office?
4300	Thanks much.
4300	Best, Jeff
4301	Hey darlin'.
4301	You on this list, too.
4301	Crazy, non?
4301	Well, what isn't crazy these days?
4301	Hope you're OK.
4302	Well, that's not helpful.
4302	Won't make things any easier.
4302	Are they an ARM member?
4302	I'll let the large customer groups know.
4302	Best, Jeff
4303	Greetings.
4303	I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.
4303	Let me know.
4303	Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.
4303	Best, Jeff
4304	Rick: With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.
4304	I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.
4304	(By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).
4304	Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.
4304	I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.
4304	I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.
4304	Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further.
4304	Take care, and thanks for listening.
4304	Best, Jeff PS Given DYN and ENE share prices today, looks like the market loves the combination.
4304	That's pretty nice.
4304	(Wouldn't know it by what Rebecca Smith keeps writing, though. Gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame.)
4305	FYI.
4305	Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.
4305	Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection.
4305	I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.
4305	The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads: "It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections. Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."
4305	Obviously, not a helpful statement.
4305	New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.
4305	Best, Jeff
4306	Hi.
4306	Could you re-email the ARM press release re: supreme court?
4306	I want to distribute it around a bit.
4306	Thanks.
4307	FYI.
4307	I notified the large customers and it appears they've taken it upon themselves to notify some of New West's customers of New West's new, "supplemental" position.
4308	You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?
4308	They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.
4308	You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?
4308	Some people you just can't get rid of....
4308	Best, Jeff
4309	I'm assuming that these are the sorts of things we should hold off on?
4310	This is very sad.
4310	Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.
4310	I love Annie and want to remember her the way she is.
4310	And I bet she would feel the same way.
4310	All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.
4310	It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for Annie, and everyone else, is for Annie to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.
4310	I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.
4310	I hope you understand.
4310	I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.
4310	Best, Jeff
4311	will do.
4312	do you have rory's email address?
4313	Hi Avram.
4313	Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.
4313	Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.
4313	Avram, could you explain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?
4313	Rory has some ideas.
4313	Best, Jeff
4314	Thought I'd add Eldon, too, since he likely has some ideas and information, too.
4315	Hi: Sorry to bug you--know things are crazy--but just checking in on the presentations we talked about yesterday.
4315	Best, Jeff
4316	Yes.
4316	Hadn't planned on going.
4317	talked to roger again.
4317	give me a call when you get a chance.
4317	Best, Jeff
4318	Thank you.
4318	Will there be a call-in number?
4318	And who else do we expect on the call?
4319	I'm at my desk.
4319	Jeff
4320	He got me.
4320	Thanks.
4321	where's this leave mcmahon?
4322	Thanks a million for your help on this.
4322	On first glance, these look great.
4322	I'll give you a ring tomorrow to discuss further.
4322	Best, Jeff
4323	No problem.
4323	Man, for someone who doesn't know much, you sure know alot, based on the note you sent.
4323	It's your call on today's lesson.
4323	If you're feeling under the weather, then we can pass for today.
4323	Otherwise, I'll show up at 4:30.
4323	Just let me know.
4323	And you can decide anytime between now and 3:30.
4323	I don't know how much Eldon and Rory can help, but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff.
4323	Best, Jeff
4324	Who loves ya baby?
4324	Hey, don't say anything to Karen, or her parents, but I'd like to get something for her parents as a thank you for Gloucester.
4324	What sorts of things do they like?
4324	You heard that Prentice got a job offer from Price Waterhouse?!
4324	See you on Friday!
4324	Best, Jeff
4325	Greetings folks: We will temporarily suspend the Wednesday, 11:30 AM call until things settle down a bit.
4325	If something crops up, we can set up a call to discuss.
4325	In the meantime, we'll be communicating regularly outside the call.
4325	Thanks very much.
4325	Best, Jeff
4326	Thanks again for the stuff.
4326	I can take it from here.
4326	Two quick questions.
4326	1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about?
4326	2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?
4326	Thanks again.
4326	I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.
4326	Best, Jeff
4327	Thanks alot.
4328	Hi Evie: As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.
4328	I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.
4328	I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.
4328	DJ and Delainey are organizing The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
4328	At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.
4328	The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.
4328	Should not take a long time.
4328	I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.
4328	Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.
4328	Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
4328	Best, Jeff
4329	plz call me when you get a minute.
4329	thx, jeff
4330	Dan: I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.
4330	The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
4330	The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).
4330	Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
4330	For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
4330	By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
4330	In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
4330	We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
4330	Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.
4330	Thanks for listening.
4330	Let me know what you think.
4330	Best, Jeff
4331	If we do it Sunday morning, I'm game.
4332	Thanks very much.
4333	Yeah, I found this out last night as was going to tell you about it.
4334	Thanks so much.
4334	That sounds great.
4334	What day of week is the 7th?
4335	I recommend that we just stick to one of the three that Joseph originally to the time and effort to select.
4335	Any chance of salvaging any of those?
4335	Best, Jeff
4336	Greetings: Left you a voicemail over the weekend.
4336	Was traveling Thurs/Fri, but got a chance to look at your reorg memo, and listened in on the call on Friday.
4336	I've got a few questions.
4336	You have 15-20 minutes today to discuss a bit?
4336	Greatly appreciated.
4336	Best, Jeff
4337	when you intend to make counter to PG&E?
4337	10Q out yet?
4338	Thanks.
4338	I'm on the California 8:30 (pst) call till about 9:30.
4338	Best, Jeff
4339	Only one call.
4339	It's at 1PM CST.
4339	Call if there's anything else.
4339	Best,Jeff
4340	This is pretty big stuff and moving pretty quickly.
4340	Understanding that times are crazy, and that it's a holiday week, if we could nonetheless begin discussing tomorrow, or even late today, that would be very useful.
4340	Best, Jeff
4341	Not all, but some.
4341	I'll give you a ring to discuss more.
4342	Wow, there is a God.
4342	Thanks.
4342	Have a great weekend.
4342	Best, Jeff
4343	thanks.
4344	I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it, but I may have it all wrong.
4344	In any case, please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the DA suspension.
4344	Community Aggregation would not be allowed after Sept 20th.
4344	Is anything you care about and/or have a position on?
4344	Thanks very much.
4344	Hope you're well.
4344	Best, Jeff
4345	No problem.
4345	Give me a little time and I'll get you some names.
4345	What's your timeframe?
4345	(Probably yesterday, right?) Best, Jeff
4346	Sorry.
4346	Was covering a meeting up the street.
4346	Got your message.
4346	I'm back.
4346	You know there are rumors flying around about you in London?
4346	Best, Jeff
4347	Greetings: Just wanted to check in to let you know that I've taken another step in getting meetings with the GM of both Anaheim and SMUD.
4347	Will let you know.
4347	Ain't moving at a lightening pace, but there's progress.
4347	Best, Jeff
4348	Jeanne: Do you have a copy of the procurement OIR?
4348	Could you email it to me if you do?
4348	Thanks very much.
4348	Best, Jeff
4349	It's more complicated still.
4349	A crazy commissioner at the CPUC now wants to require everyone to submit their DA contracts to Commission for review.
4349	It's attached.
4349	Folks are going to oppose it very strongly.
4349	I'm available to talk.
4349	I'm not sure that the Oct. 5th date has got legs.
4349	Best, Jeff
4350	My apologies for the delay.
4350	About three other bonfires cropped up after I talked to you.
4350	In any case, the answer to your question, is yes, we can switch our customers to dual billing if we choose to do so.
4350	If you have any other questions, just let me know.
4350	Best, Jeff
4351	You're a helluva guy.
4351	I'm damned proud to be associated with you, and hope to continue in the future.
4351	If we don't get a chance to talk between now and tomorrow, have a great Thanksgiving.
4351	And Rick, I'm not a very religious guy, but god bless you.
4351	Best, Jeff
4352	Thanks, Dan.
4352	I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have any choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer up any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attempt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due process rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.
4352	Best, Jeff
4353	Very yummy dinner.
4353	So light.
4353	So fluffy.
4353	Your friend Renee is very nice.
4353	Thanks.
4354	dude: you guys won first (even after those bad picks you made).
4354	Congratz.
4354	don't look over your shoulder, cuz we're right on your heels!
4355	So sorry to hear about your nose.
4355	How bad is it?
4355	Swollen?
4355	Your eyes OK?
4355	Expected to heal quickly?
4356	Greetings Dan: Few things.
4356	Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
4356	Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.
4356	Any indication of who that person might be?
4356	We're anxious to start meeting with them.
4356	Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers?
4356	Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?
4356	If so, how have they reacted?
4356	Have a great holiday weekend.
4356	Best, Jeff
4357	wouldn't miss it.
4357	how's lil' annie doing?
4358	"paid" is right.
4358	jeff just keeps paying, and paying, and paying...
4359	got your message and sorry i didn't get back to you.
4359	wanted to thank you very much for taking the time on such short notice, and, from what I've heard from others, for having done an outstanding job.
4359	Thanks again.
4359	And yes, we'll take the victories when we can get them.
4359	Best, Jeff
4360	prentice's haas address is no longer valid.
4360	you'll need to send to "psellers@pacbell.net."
4361	Looks like the market ain't crazy about our 10Q.
4361	You get the go ahead from Whalley on PG&E?
4362	how'd it go?
4362	and how you doing?
4363	i'm back in office.
4363	jeff
4364	Hi.
4364	I read Karl's ruling on the contracts.
4364	Just about had it with that bozo.
4364	I'm assuming that the customers are going to resist?
4365	Hey man, you feeling any better?
4366	what would you like me to bring and/or do for Friday?
4367	Hello: First, forget it all and have a wonderful holiday.
4367	Second, given the immense challenges, I've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid.
4367	So I sent to Rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school.
4367	Do you know if he got it?
4367	Best, Jeff
4368	Thanks very much.
4368	If possible, I'd like to listen in. That possible?
4368	And have a very nice holiday.
4368	Best, Jeff
4369	test
4370	test
4371	Very quick and dirty--not even fully proofed.
4371	But wanted to get something out for folks to shoot at.
4371	Let me know your thoughts.
4371	Sure I've missed about a million things and mucked up about the same amount.
4371	Happy Thanksgiving.
4371	Best, Jeff
4372	Here it is.
4372	Apologies that it's very sketchy and barely proofed, but wanted to get something out to folks to shoot at.
4372	Have a great holiday.
4372	Best, Jeff
4373	FYI.
4374	PG&E called.
4374	They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.
4374	They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks.
4374	Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.
4374	Thanks.
4374	Best, Jeff
4375	Thanks, Lamar.
4375	Geoff, could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end.
4375	Thanks very much.
4375	Best, Jeff
4376	Thanks very much.
4377	Thanks so much for the call back.
4377	Here it is.
4377	It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.
4377	Couple of things.
4377	I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.
4377	I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.
4377	If not, let me know.
4377	Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).
4377	Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.
4377	If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.
4377	Really appreciate all your help.
4377	My number is 415.782.7822.
4377	Best, Jeff
4378	Sue: This woman from NewWest is driving me crazy.
4378	Best, Jeff
4379	Greetings: I just talked to Marcie.
4379	She's interested, but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting.
4379	Aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with SMUD and Anaheim?
4379	Do we have anything else that I can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting?
4379	Will get back to you very soon about meeting with Schori at SMUD.
4379	Best, Jeff
4380	Plan of Reorganization.
4381	Can you forward me both?
4381	I'll take a look at them.
4381	Maybe they'll do the trick.
4381	Also, do you have that press article where we partnered with a muni (in Canada, I think)?
4382	This time with attachment...
4383	Thanks?
4383	Brown going to vote for it?
4384	Greetings Ms Denne: Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing.
4384	A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about Enron partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.
4384	Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?
4384	I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!
4384	Greatly appreciated.
4384	Best, Jeff
4385	Janelle: Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to Marcie.
4385	Let me know what you think.
4385	Best, Jeff Hi Marcie: Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.
4385	Elena tells me that you're having a great time.
4385	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.
4385	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.
4385	I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.
4385	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.
4385	Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.
4385	Here are some of the program's highlights: Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.
4385	Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name.
4385	Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.
4385	Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.
4385	Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses.
4385	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.
4385	If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.
4385	All the best, Jeff
4386	and we ate more last night and we're still alive.
4386	Thanks very much for your hospitality and a really fun time.
4387	Thanks.
4387	If we ever get out of this mess, you can rest assured that I'll help out.
4387	Can you remind again right after the first of the year, at which time we should have a better idea of where this ship is heading?
4387	Thanks.
4387	Best, Jeff
4388	please review this one.
4388	i just read the contract and there is no end date.
4388	it's open-ended and simply says that we can end at our discretion.
4389	Thanks very much for getting the contracts for me.
4389	Please address one each to Bev and Hedy on our letter head so I can sign and send out today.
4389	Thanks a bunch.
4390	The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).
4390	There continues to be debates over the specifics.
4390	Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.
4390	If you have any questions, give a holler.
4390	Best, Jeff
4391	No problem.
4392	Apologies just got back.
4392	Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.
4392	Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.
4392	So I concur with Bill and Aaron.
4392	Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?
4392	Best, Jeff
4393	did i ask you to fax copies of the hedy/bev letter to ginger?
4393	signed,
4394	Thanks, Geoff.
4394	May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account.
4394	Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.
4394	Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.
4394	He may want to make the contact.
4394	Jim, thoughts?
4394	Best, Jeff
4395	Will do.
4395	Thanks again for getting to the bottom of it.
4396	got that one covered too while you were out.
4397	de nada
4398	Sounds like were back at plan b.
4399	that's neat.
4399	please give them both my best.
4400	call me.
4400	thanks.
4400	jeff 415.782.7822.
4401	really sorry to bother you with this, but any idea of whether my tuition reimbursement has successfully made it's way through?
4401	Thanks a million.
4401	Best, Jeff
4402	FYI.
4402	Looks like many are exploring.
4402	Probably value in staying coordinate internally.
4402	I'll give Alan a call.
4402	Best, Jeff
4403	Hey, just checking in to see if you're still out there.
4403	What a story.
4403	Hope you weathering things ok.
4403	Best, Jeff
4404	Greetings.
4404	Well, it's about over for the company known as Enron.
4404	Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.
4404	But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive.
4404	It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.
4404	But it is what it is.
4404	As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around.
4404	I've already had a few calls from "inquiring minds," so we'll we where things end up.
4404	Thanks so much for the thoughts.
4404	Definitely crazy times, but I'm not getting to worked up about it.
4404	And besides, Prentice has accepted PWC's offer, so I'm looking forward to housekeeping!
4404	Best, Jeff
4405	Well, I think that Enron's fate is going to affect everyone, including me.
4405	But no worries, I'll land on my feet.
4405	Love to have tea, just let me know when.
4405	How you doing?
4406	You're a good man.
4406	Thanks.
4406	You may regret having offered, though, since there's an extremely good chance that I'm likely to take you up on it.
4407	OK, now I'm getting choked up.
4407	Thanks, man.
4408	FYI.
4408	Thank you both very much for your help on this.
4408	Best, Jeff
4409	call me re: ISO.
4409	Jeff 415.782.7822.
4410	boy, you really did save this stuff.
4410	i don't know who the author is, but, man, what a wit!
4411	shoot me a draft of the withdrawal before you send it in so i can say that i reviewed prior to submission.
4411	thanks.
4411	Jeff
4412	u hear about ISO?
4412	give a call.
4412	jeff 415.782.7822
4413	Thanks very much.
4413	Really appreciate the help.
4413	I'll submit them just as soon as I get them.
4413	Have a nice weekend, despite it all.
4413	Best, Jeff
4414	You've really been nice about this.
4414	Thanks very much.
4414	Could I stay in SF and work for NEG?
4414	And people don't really hate me, do they?
4414	(Kidding.) I'll give Dan a call.
4414	Have a great weekend.
4414	Best, Jeff
4415	A regulah laugh riot, that's what she is.
4415	Prentice, you're the best birthday present I could ever have--even better than money.
4415	xoxoxox
4416	Thanks, and ditto, my friend.
4416	You're a rare individual at the company.
4416	And it shows.
4416	Please be sure to spend a little time looking after yourself and your loved ones, since you've been doing a great job spending so much time caring and looking out for the rest of us.
4416	Best, Jeff
4417	should i stop working?
4417	no big deal, really.
4417	but don't want to continue, if it doesn't make sense.
4417	thanks, jeff
4418	Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.
4418	You know that I've really come to love that crazy dog, and it meant a lot that you and Eldon were always so caring.
4418	She is truly a lovely dog and I'll miss her immensely, but it helps that everyone was so loving.
4418	And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off.
4418	Thanks again so much for everything.
4418	Hugs, Jeff
4419	All the very best to you and yours.
4419	See on 1400Smith.com.
4419	Best, Jeff
4420	I'm going to work the rest of the day from home--I will be working, though (it's just not easy to work from the office today, as you can imagine).
4420	You can reach me by email and cell phone 415.505.6633.
4420	Hang in there buddy.
4420	Best, Jeff
4421	Will do.
4421	Computer just got back up!
4422	Many thanks to Elizabeth and Margo for helping to get email working again.
4422	Best, Jeff
4423	I'll call you very soon.
4424	what's "sheltercorp?"
4425	my email's back up....................................for now.
4425	Best, Jeff
4426	call when you can.
4426	thanks.
4426	jeff
4427	Perhaps, given Nancy's note, you didn't get my previous email saying that I'm back up (for now).
4427	Greetings all.
4427	Best, Jeff
4428	Hi.
4428	Could you keep Annie's leash(es) and collars?
4429	Dude: You started searching for ski gear for Cameron yet?
4429	Love to work on it together, if possible.
4429	Maybe, if we're buying two sets of skis, boots, poles, we'll get a discount.
4429	You still plan on getting that?
4429	Best, Jeff
4430	Greetings.
4430	Last night, we were hanging out the the CEO of Cameron's company and it turns out that he's a recording freak with unbelievable equipment and he'd likely be willing to record a TRUE BLUE CD FOR FREE.
4430	Give a call when you get a minute.
4430	415.782.7822.
4430	Best, Jeff
4431	Where have you heard that?
4431	And what is it saying?
4431	PS I don't think that "To Welsh" is a politically correct term.
4431	Best, Jeff
4432	call when u can.
4432	IOUs jointly filed w/PUC saying "no assignments."
4432	Jeff
4433	Greetings.
4433	Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.
4433	Here's the latest: As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).
4433	Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
4433	In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
4433	(I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....) However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
4433	OK, back to Enron.
4433	It's a mess (surprise).
4433	I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.
4433	At least through the end of the year, it appears.
4433	Sue and Joseph have left.
4433	If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
4433	We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
4433	Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
4433	This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied.
4433	HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.
4433	Thanks so much.
4433	Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.
4433	Best, Jeff
4434	Greetings: First, thanks for the pizza.
4434	Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..
4434	Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.
4434	Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.
4434	Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.
4434	Just let me know.
4434	Best, Jeff
4435	Joseph: Good news!
4435	Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.
4435	All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.
4435	I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or if she expected some "beefing up."
4435	I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.
4435	I'll let you know how she responds.
4435	Great job by all.
4435	Best, Jeff
4436	Hi.
4436	Hey, I can't open this.
4436	Hugs, Jeff
4437	Thanks, very much Alan.
4437	Hedy, Bev and Scott are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.
4437	Let's do this.
4437	I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back.
4437	In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.
4437	Sound reasonable?
4437	Best, Jeff
4438	Paul: Thanks very much for the note.
4438	For the moment, we do still intend to go ahead with the projects and will stay in very close contact with you should the situation change.
4438	If you have any questions, please let me know.
4438	Best, Jeff
4439	Got your message.
4439	Likely makes sense to also call Evie Elsesser and Dan Carroll.
4439	Let me know if there's anything else.
4439	Best, Jeff
4440	Great.
4440	You know this is a pure "lobbyist" meeting, right?
4440	You may want to do by phone, if possible.
4440	Your call.
4441	Greetings Professor: I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.
4441	Few items: --I assume that you returned papers.
4441	I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.
4441	Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).
4441	Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.
4441	--I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.
4441	Thanks very much.
4441	Best, Jeff
4442	Here's my take.
4442	Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.
4442	From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.
4442	However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.
4442	But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.
4442	That's my take.
4442	Best, Jeff
4443	what's up?
4444	Thanks Robert.
4444	Sounds good.
4444	FYI.
4444	Prentice and I are getting Haley the portable CD player.
4445	Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.
4445	I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.
4445	Let me know if I'm missing something here.
4445	Again, apologize for keeping on about it.
4445	Best, Jeff
4446	Thanks very much?
4446	Does that mean that the Hansen contract would be sold as a stand-alone asset?
4447	Thanks for getting in touch.
4447	Yes, we can schedule.
4447	Do you know who all would participate?
4447	Best, Jeff
4448	As soon as I get my grades (which I hope will be mid-late December), I'll send them to Ginger in the attempt to get tuition reimbursed.
4448	But don't worry, I have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed.
4448	This plan make sense?
4448	Best, Jeff
4449	Thanks.
4450	FYI.
4451	thanks.
4452	Had a long chat with UC that I'd like to pass along, and a couple of additional issues arose in the course of the talk that I'd also like to discuss.
4452	Is it possible to talk for 15 minutes first thing in the morning.
4452	Best, Jeff
4453	so you guys want to come by P&C's before dinner at La Folie, or do just want to meet at the restaurant?
4453	Be great if you could come by and have a glass of champagne first.
4453	Best, Jeff
4454	Ain't got it yet.
4454	415.782.7854.
4454	Thanks a million.
4455	Greetings.
4455	You decide to have a call of the walking wounded today?
4455	Best, Jeff
4456	got the fax.
4456	thanks.
4457	Prentice left her phone with me, so if you need to get a hold of her, it's going to be a little tough till later on.
4457	Jeff
4458	Thanks.
4458	you do the same.
4459	Thanks so much.
4459	I'll email when faxed.
4459	Best, Jeff
4460	One other thing.
4460	I just had coffee with a former business colleague.
4460	She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).
4460	I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t.
4460	setting up board, staff, etc. She's very interested.
4460	She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.
4460	Are you interested in talking to her?
4460	Best, Jeff
4461	Greetings professor: Should be coming over your fax machine any minute.
4461	Have a very nice holiday and thanks for a very interesting, thought-provoking and challenging course.
4461	Best, Jeff

4462	jeff

4463	jeff
4464	u find it?

4464	reg is $1K.
4464	jeff
4465	Greetings.
4465	I plan to turn the final in tomorrow.
4465	But I have a quick question about homework number 4.
4465	Is it possible to call you today to ask what I hope will be a 5 minute question?
4465	Thanks very much.
4465	Best, Jeff
4466	You have just used your quota of exclamation points for the remainder of this year and for all of 2002.
4466	It was very fun.
4467	may have them sold.
4467	$50 apiece?
4468	So you're the one who gave me this cold.
4468	Just wanted to let you know that I've been working on the resume (in between work and finals) and will try to have you a draft by end of this week, or next Monday.
4468	Get better.
4468	Best, Jeff
4469	Very sweet.
4469	Thanks.
4469	Well, I tried.
4469	No taker on the tickets.
4469	Looks like you'll have to give them to your Neanderthal friend.
4469	Or what about Jack and dottie?
4470	call me.
4470	jeff.
4470	415.782.7822.
4471	call me.
4471	re: PUC inquiry.
4471	looks like it will move fast--w/testimony.
4471	jeff
4472	Hey.
4472	I'm still trying to get through school and now I've come down with a cold, so I need to take a pass on tomorrow's lesson.
4472	Any chance of coming on Friday.
4472	I don't know what shape I'll be in, but if there's an opening, maybe I can make it.
4472	Best, Jeff
4473	I'd love tickets.
4473	but don't kill yourself over.
4473	Get better--cold's not bad, but it's damned annoying.
4474	The trust could not run deeper.
4474	Just to clarify, we'll want to focus solely and exclusively on the registration.
4474	We're not in arrears on the bond.....yet.
4474	Thanks a bunch.
4474	Best, Jeff
4475	Sweet.
4475	Thanks.
4476	Nancy: Here is the final.
4476	Couple things.
4476	The short answers are in the word document.
4476	The long answers are in two separate excel files.
4476	I used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer (the Fannie Mae question).
4476	You can find the answer in a tab titled "Long Answer--Question IIb" and it's highlighted by yellow background.
4476	The data for the problem is in the "data" tab.
4476	Thanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future.
4476	All the best, Jeff
4477	Here they are.
4477	Please let me know that you've received them.
4477	Joseph: good luck including duration to the correct spreadsheet!
4477	And thanks for sending them along to Nancy.
4477	Let's talk and figure out a time to get together.
4477	Best, Jeff
4478	will do.
4478	what's your fax number?
4479	can you please fax thing we were faxing yesterday to jeremy.
4479	i'm much obliged.
4480	Just talked to the PUC.
4480	Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.
4480	Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.
4480	HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.
4480	She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.
4480	She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info.
4480	Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?
4480	We need to get info on that.
4480	We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.
4480	Let me know if you have any questions, and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.
4480	Thanks, Jeff
4481	Thanks.
4481	Hanging in there about as well as everyone is.
4481	No worries on getting back to me.
4481	Just wanted to keep folks in the loop.
4481	Been in contact with the desk.
4481	Best of luck with the transaction.
4481	Enjoy the time off.
4481	Talk to you in a couple days.
4481	Best, Jeff
4482	I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester.
4482	Just wanted to say congratulations.
4482	I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish.
4482	Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.
4482	Happy Holidays to all.
4482	And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch.
4482	Best, Jeff
4483	Greetings: Just checking in. What's up?
4483	Hope all is OK, or at least as OK as it can be.
4483	Best, Jeff
4484	Greetings.
4484	Long time, no talk.
4484	Just wanted to check in, say hello.
4484	Hope, given these wild times, that all is well with you and yours.
4484	Best, Jeff
4485	Calpine has cratered to 13.15 at last look.
4485	50MM shares traded today.
4485	This is starting to look like the dot-com implosion.
4486	Appreciate it.
4486	Thanks.
4487	She's gotta be freaking.
4487	Can you imagine going through this twice!?
4488	Cool.
4488	Enjoy the travel.
4489	hey, call me.
4489	jeff
4490	Hi Sandy: Can you and John make a call on Friday with Portland to discuss our response to the PUC questions?
4490	Best, Jeff
4491	How in the world did you get Brown to vote for the NGS?!
4491	Very impressive.
4491	Also, couldn't believe it when I saw Frank Lindh in the news.
4491	My heart goes out to him.
4491	Best, Jeff
4492	Thanks.
4493	Thanks for forwarding them along.
4493	At some point this evening, I'll be done with the semester.
4493	Hope you guys are done soon, too.
4493	Congratulations for another semester down, and ONE to go.
4493	Best, Jeff
4494	Greetings Professor: Attached is the final case for E278.
4494	Could you confirm that you've received it?
4494	Thanks for an interesting and stimulating course.
4494	Have a great holiday and I hope that our paths cross sometime in the not-to-distant future.
4494	All the best, Jeff
4495	Gee, sure was nice of Andy Fastow to wish us all happy holidays.
4495	You see the Lehrer News Hour spot on Enron last night?
4495	Very ugly.
4495	Sure seems like folks will be testifying before Congress (much) rather than later...Oh, and remind me to thank Anderson for their supportive comments--looks like a mud-fight is brewing.
4495	Hope you're doing OK.
4495	Best, Jeff
4496	Thanks for dinner.
4496	Very yummy.
4497	Any way for me to get a hold of Scott?
4498	you already looking to jump ship?
4499	this represent a big shake up?
4500	Greetings TJ: Hope all is well with you and yours.
4500	Two quick questions: 1) When can we expect to get our grades?
4500	I have a tuition reimbursement "issue" and would like to get the grades ASAP.
4500	Any idea?
4500	Much appreciated.
4500	2) Where do I go and how do I get there to uncover what classes I ended up getting in the bidding process.
4500	Thanks for everything and have a great holiday.
4500	Best, Jeff
4501	None here.
4502	Thanks.
4502	I'll take care of it.

0	Judy, I was accidently included on the distribution list for the retirement announcement from Omaha.
0	My name is John Forney and my family is from Crete Nebraska.
0	My grandfather, Lester Forney, was a doctor in Lincoln.
0	Any relation, as I dont hear our last name very often?
0	Enron Power Trading
1	I have purchased from Duke 100 mw's at $51 for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .
1	Duke is transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.
1	In the event of TLR's, we have the option of cutting this supply, without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
1	If this happens, of course you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no.
1	above.
1	The purchases go in the ST SPP book.
1	Once again, If RT has to intervene, please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.
1	Also, let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.
1	You guys are doing a good job.
2	I need tickets to an Astros game on May 18th.
2	We will be entertaining 7 people from Entergy and approx.
2	5 Enron people.
2	Is there access to a box or, at least, blocks of seats together?
2	Thanks,
3	Mikey, Please see the attached and tell me if I am smoking crack.
3	This calc would show me eating the difference between the purchase and sale prices, although I have no position on this day.
3	You can go into the tab marked "May1."
3	Thanks,
4	John - How is business?
4	Things not as fun here as PDX.
4	I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate: 1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.
4	It has 64k and the interior is flawless.
4	The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips, etc in the front.
4	The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.
4	The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.
4	It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.
4	Heres the kicker: the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.
4	I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.
4	It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.
4	The car drives great.
4	Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?
4	The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.
4	Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?
4	The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.
4	The retail is supposedly $33k.
4	What am I missing here?
4	Thanks,
5	Bobby - How's it going in PDX?
5	Things very different here in this "market."
5	It is difficult to trade against monopoly power.
5	Book currently melting down, however, things are turning around.
5	Here; nuke goes down, very hot weather.............
5	prices tank.
5	The transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity, driving up prices, and they release the capacity in mid trading, crushing the dailies.
5	We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner.
5	Pig forkers!
5	Anyway, I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet, but I'm still trying.
5	Presto and the other traders call my region "Jimmy land," as most of the players are rednecks named Jimmy.
5	Hope the wife and Floyd are doing well.
5	Lot's of bad golf being played here!
5	Let me know when you are coming down - we will drink tequila at the Cadillac Bar.
6	Thanks for keeping me updated, jackie!
6	Seriously, how are things going in the homeland?
6	Are you glad to be back?
6	Let me know what 's happening.
6	I havent talked to brother Jimmy lately.
6	He is not answering his phone here.
6	Say hello to the wife - we never hear from anyone in Portland.
6	Knock em dead in your new job!
7	Bill, I talked with Hans at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape, but did probably need a valve adjustment, as you relayed.
7	Maybe also an oil leak fixed.
7	Also, I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.
7	The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars, the clutch being a common and costly repair.
7	The exterior of the car is in fair condition.
7	Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out.
7	I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car, but you cant get it done inexpensively.
7	I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.
7	However, I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until Sunday.
7	Maybe we can meet then.
7	If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car, I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost) and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.
7	I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old, but it is a large investment.....
7	Thanks, Bill for your time.
7	My cell number is 713-412-7529.
8	Thanks for asking - things are still pretty tough here, but I determined to make it work.
8	I am a Director now - would your management be concerned about that?- just curious.
9	Chuck, Lee Dean with Primrose Oil called our West Desk to inquire about electricity service to their field in Texas.
9	His number is 940-322-1077.
9	If you could pass this along to the appropriate salesperson, I would appreciate it.
9	Thanks,
10	Things are going pretty well - balance of month trading $43.75 in Entergy and it is going to be 90 degrees all of next week!
10	I heard that PV is down and its 1,000 degrees in the desert - you guys must be busy.
10	Dave Ryan called for mild in the Northeast next week when Earthsat was preaching hot ........
10	did really well on that deal as I was short balmo the Cinergy.
10	He's the man (this week).
10	I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby.
10	That was a good time, but it was bright sun and hot, while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie.
10	There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.
10	He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.
10	He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings, so he put it back on..........poor bastard.
10	Louisville Slugger factory and museum kicked ass.
10	They had all the original bats from Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, etc to current players.
10	The have been custom making bats since like 1847.
10	Good trip - see you there next year!
11	Bryan, please give me a call at 3-7160 to arrange meeting.
12	I am interested in obtaining parking in the new Enron parking garage.
12	I am currently in the Kellogg building.
12	Thanks, John Forney Director, East Power Trading
13	Elizabeth, My name is John Forney and I am the new Electricity Cash trader in the Entergy region, reporting to Kevin Presto.
13	I received a letter agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy "Into" definition.
13	Rogers Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an EEI agreement, where they have been willing to only operate under WSPP.
13	They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP contract with EEI liquidated damages language.
13	I need to meet with you on this issue.
13	Rogers is available to anwer questions on the background of this , if necessary.
13	Thanks,
14	Joan, I left a message for you today concerning your e-mail.
14	Do you still need someone?
14	I would like to ask you some specific questions again, so give me a call.
14	I am at 3-7160.
14	Thanks,
15	Thanks for checking - very unhappy with the situation here.
15	Very unprofessional and juvenile atmosphere.
15	Looking to leave the company if something doesnt open up internally.
16	i have notified Presto that I will be looking internally.
16	i am talking to portland, as they want me back.
16	i have been moved to the Texas region to supply the Texas Choice and EES customers on an hourly basis.
16	I would manage this desk and, once again , have an hourly crew, much the same as I did in California.
16	That is not the job I signed up for when I moved 3,000 miles to Houston.
16	I have already been there, done that and I am not pleased about it so far, but it will be allright.
16	If I did this job, it would become a big success and then I would have to hear about how lucky I was.
16	I'll keep you posted......it's shit like this that keeps work interesting.
17	Thanks for listening on last week's phone call.
17	I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.
17	If you have not heard, the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.
17	This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these respective regions.
17	My inexperience in the term is the reason given for my implied demotion, although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for other players.
17	This had been the first month that I've had access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k; there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.
17	I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot, but would be considering other options in Houston, or even Portland.
17	I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.
17	The job in Houston may be a good opportunity, however, the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional goals.
17	I am looking for other opportunities, preferably within the company.
17	If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set, let me know - I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.
17	You certainly are under no obligation to do this, but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company, possibly on the retail side.
17	Thanks for your time,
18	Frank, I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.
18	Although you mentioned that the $1,800 (the amount in my account) is a small sum, I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm, given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.
18	I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time; I dont expect this.
18	However, I do expect some consistent contact from a broker who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.
18	My view will be that the more success we have, the more money I will be willing to invest.
18	I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
18	I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.
18	I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.
18	I will not use your suggestions to trade at discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.
18	I look forward to hearing from you.
19	Kim, I'm sorry I did not get to come to your open house.
19	I got the message on the day of the party and I forgot to RSVP that I couldnt attend.
19	I am a jackass, but you knew that already......................
19	Hope all went well.
19	How's the new job?
20	I have relocated from the West Desk in Portland Oregon and have been advised by our Legal Dept. that I should not delete any e-mails until further notice.
20	Please advise.
21	Thanks for handling this!
22	Jim Flores - did he also work in Finance?
22	I dont remember him...
23	How is it going with baby Wolf?
23	I want to make sure everything is ok before I call him.
23	Done any good deals lately?
23	At least tell me about hiking.
24	Kim, I need to speak with you at your earliest convenience.
24	Please call me at 3-7160.
24	Thanks,
25	it's a power thang.....
26	I will be attending a funeral tomorrow, but I am available to meet on Tuesday.
26	Thank you for checking back with me.
27	Kim, Can we meet around noon?
28	That would be fine - just give me a call and let me know when you can meet.
29	You are down.
30	Hey, looks like I will be returning to Portland.
30	They want me back and it is a much better place to work.
30	HR is wanting me to consider other opportunities in Houston, however.
30	They have one week to come up with something, otherwise I'm outta here.
30	Other companies are paying ridiculous sums to experienced West traders (California experience).
30	Thanks for considering me for your group and I'll keep you updated.
31	Kim, Thanks for spending time with me yesterday.
31	I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was.
31	I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland, however, I would be considering other options within the company for one week.
31	My thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto, Doug and Lloyd.
31	I will communicate this today, unless you have other ideas.
31	As discussed, I have attached a copy of my resume.
31	It is getting kind of long, but I havent really gotten a chance to "abbreviate."
31	Thanks again for helping,
32	It looks like we will be moving back to Portland before summer starts.
32	The job didnt turn out as promised and I was put into a role that I didnt want.
32	Oh well.
32	The Portland team still wants me and has offered 4 different roles to choose from.
32	You cant beat that.
32	Anyway, I will let you know how it turns out.
33	I will come by sometime after 8:30 am if that is okay.
33	Thanks!
34	Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.
34	Hope she's a good sleeper.
34	Now at least you can field some different questions, "how is the baby?"
34	versus "where is the baby?"
34	But, as Kim used to say, "enough about you, let's talk about me."
34	I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.
34	He mentioned that West has needs in Services, Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.
34	I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt, as I could build upon my experience and also learn as much of the structuring side as possible.
34	Wherever I go, I am ready to make an impact.
34	The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.
34	I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here, as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.
34	However, Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.
34	I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here, but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.
34	Anyway, I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss, but that's probably not practical.
34	Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.
34	I know that you are out of the office, but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.
34	Thanks,
35	Amy, Hope everything is going well with you.
35	I dont know if Tim has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.
35	I am talking with Wolfe and Tim, but I would like to keep things low key.
35	I know this all seems pretty weird, but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major, immediate decisions to make.
35	Basically, the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real Time, similar to how we did it in Portland.
35	Unfortunately, that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).
35	Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had, I never would have left.
35	Anyway, Kim Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within Enron Houston and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.
35	She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.
35	However, I have expressed to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland.
35	I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.
35	I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.
35	I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.
35	Thanks, I
36	Bart, Jeff passed on your e-mail.
36	Too bad about the beetles.
36	Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?
36	"Taylor, home of the fighting beetles,"....
36	Go beetles!
36	I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up, but it just reemphasizes the need for you; they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.
36	Well, enough about you, let's talk about me..............
36	the Entergy gig was made more difficult, as I received NO training in cash trading.
36	After a couple of months, a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging, which is especially important in my region.
36	The month of May was very profitable, finally, and things were coming together until..........
36	(Please keep this confidential) Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group, his decision being final, no negotiations.
36	(thanks for your understanding, bunghole).
36	I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.
36	I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with, given that we have retail load to service, etc. However, thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.
36	I suspect other changes would ensue, once I established this region.
36	So.
36	It looks like I will be returning to Portland.
36	We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything, except my job (which is a huge thing).
36	I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.
36	I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.
36	Anyway, I was pissed in the beginning, but I had to take time to digest this, analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.
36	I am too deep in the (out of the money) options to cut and run, so it now boils down to where do I want to live.
36	There is interest outside of the company in me, but I am under contract.
36	I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.
36	I must be a mountain man at heart.
36	Well, let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.
36	Once again, I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk, just yet.
36	I heard that you did really well on your home sale.
36	That's awesome.
36	Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.
36	(just kidding).
36	I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.
36	How is your housing in Taylor?
36	I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.
36	It is freaking hot here in Texas!
36	Anyway, keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!
37	Kim, My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.
37	Do I turn those in to you?
37	I am due the closing costs, etc. due to my move from Portland.
37	Also, Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.
37	I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
37	Johnny, however, was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position.
37	I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe, Tim Belden, and Amy Fitzpatrick) If nothing opens up here by Wednesday, I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
37	I am still building, staffing, & trading for the Ercot region, but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.
37	Thanks!
38	Brett, Have heard that Platter was given trading responsibility on EOL for offpeak California and other markets.
38	I heard he has done an awesome job and Richter & the gang are really happy with him.
38	He is motivated and challenged, which is what he needed.
38	As far as timing, I dont know yet.
38	Could be next week or next month.
38	I kind of wanted to work on the Ercot desk, but not for Presto.
38	Anyway, keep in touch you wino.
39	Kim, I spoke with Cammi Mursch with the outside relo company.
39	She said she is handling my account and I should send her my expenses for reimbursement.
39	I think that this will take care of me.
39	Thanks,
40	Linus, check this out: Go under Texas City and you can get some good webcam action, wind speed and direction.
40	Also, you can call one of the bait camps and get directions.
41	The opportunity here has been enhanced; in addition to Managing RT, I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.
41	This includes trading around a 500 mw plant, serving EES and New Power Company loads, and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal.
41	Of course, I would have to have all of this in writing.
41	I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
41	This makes the offer more attractive, but still I would be in Houston.
41	I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.
41	What do you think?
42	Please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas, the listed static scheduling fee applies.
42	For example, if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA, the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat $65.
42	Also applicable would be the per mw line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22 .
42	Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.
42	Thanks,
43	Andrea, Please see the attached spreadsheet for Friday.
43	All of the deals listed have been moved to Teco Services for this day only.
43	We entered a buy (which is an estimate of the cost of gen) and the appropriate sales.
43	We need to talk about how this gets reconciled.
43	I would like to know the detail of this transaction.
43	I know that not everything has been discussed with this account, so I would like to discuss it.
43	I am positive that I need to change all deals for over the weekend.
43	We had some length for this customer that was sold hourly.
43	I assume that everything from now on will be entered under Teco Services for this account.
43	Can you think of any exceptions?
43	I will let you know when the weekend is complete.
43	Thanks,
44	I still have a need for an Analyst within the group, preferably for a one year rotation.
44	Thanks,
45	Clinton, Due to the flood, our phones rolled over to the Portland office on Saturday.
45	Geir Solberg sold hours 13-15, 230 mw's each hour to CSCS for $25.
45	I have entered the deals today and they are as follows: Frontera, deal no.
45	644515, entered under Teco Services book AEP deal no.
45	644529, also entered under Teco Services.
45	I dont know how the reconciliation of this Services book takes place.
45	I am working on some procedures and need some input.
45	Lets party,
46	Lloyd, Do I need to input security requests for this guy to get Enpower, telephone, etc?
47	IM SURE GLAD THAT THE CONCERT WAS CANCELLED BECAUSE I HAD THE WORST HANGOVER EVER.
47	CHECK THESE ;PHOTOS OUT!
48	Was Tom pissed?
48	Whats up?
49	Can I get a copy of your group's expectations?
49	I need to also discuss with you the duties of all the night guys.
49	As I understand it, they all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions.
49	What about reconciliation reports - what is required?
49	What other reports need to be tied out - the Sched Activity report vs. the P&L sheet?
50	Michael, we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.
50	That's not suprising, however.
50	Does Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?
50	What is the reason for this fee?
50	Thanks,
51	Hey Lloyd, As you know, Joe and Steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood.
51	I would think that some recognition would be in order.
51	How about a personal best of $500, or a gift certificate, etc.?
51	What do you think?
52	cool
53	FYI
54	Please see the attached site.
54	The logon for this is: ljester password is: 38zpzz You can copy existing Oasis requests or create new.
55	Here it is..
56	Okay, so we now have a procedure.
56	I will broadcast to the group and see that it is implemented.
56	I still havent completed all of their discrepancy checkout.
56	I have been working nights through the weekend and tonite.
56	I will address these on Tuesday.
56	Clint will be helping me to resolve these and future issues.
56	Thanks,
57	I agreed to stay through the end of the year (February) to get this project off of the ground.
57	What I get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in Texas, a 500 mw unit, Frontera, and a 100 mw heat rate call from the City of Austin.
57	I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing.
57	It is too late in the year for me to move to Portland, get out and make a contribution for the summer.
57	These guys are in terrible shape here, and I am needed.
57	I report to Lloyd Will, who is a great guy.
57	I am working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the Ercot Term trader.
57	He has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and I am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel.
57	I will be working with Miller and Smith (weeeeeelllll?) This was the best option for me at this time, and also for the company.
57	I will be leaving the main office in February, whether it is with Enron or not.
57	I would prefer to stay with the company, as my options are worth zero at the moment.
57	We still want to return to Portland, but right now I am needed here.
57	Thanks for checking.
57	Let me know when you are coming down, but dont bring your sweater.
57	Hope things are going well for you and your group.
57	I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what.
57	(hey, I never used to say that - you were stereotyping).
57	Later,
58	The turrrets are programmed in the order of personal preference.
58	However, you can use someone's while they are gone.
58	I will get you access to Watt's or Eric's.
58	Thanks,
59	Juan, Check this out:
60	We have four direct lines to the Ercot ISO that have been installed on each of your turrets.
60	As an ISO participant, we are required to be staffed 24-7 to handle any request from the ISO concerning our generation, or to handle contingencies related to our preschedules.
60	If any of these lines should ring, we need to be sure to pick it up.
60	Ercot may just be testing our responsiveness, or , they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now.
60	Any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to Smith Day or myself.
60	We will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the ISO.
60	For RT purposes, this will be used for billing purposes.
60	Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.
60	They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.
60	We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.
60	I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.
60	This can be a broad overview, or we can drill down to specifics at your request.
60	Thanks for your attention.
61	Remember how bad T.A.
61	reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work, reconciliation, etc. ?
61	THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.
61	Settlements is working hard, but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here, as it would be political suicide.
61	That's why she turned toward us.
61	She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO, and I talked to her, explaining my expectations.
61	She was squirming about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.
61	Im cool with that, but cant you find out?
61	Everything is such a big struggle here.
61	Im not coming until February at the earliest.
61	I am an Oregonian.
61	The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.
61	I forgot about that bit of joy.
61	Later,
62	That's allright, go ahead and cancel my order.
62	Thanks,
63	As you know, the Frontera status screen goes away at night, as the flat screens are taken down.
63	You can find the same screen on the East Power Portal under Frontera Production Summary.
63	Save the attached link if you dont have already.
64	Lloyd, Thanks for your help on this issue.
64	Sorry for the delayed response.
64	I think I have my facts somewhat straight, but I am available to answer questions.
65	Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
65	Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.
65	Additionally, we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.
65	One of our service customers, Teco, wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.
65	Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
65	He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.
65	He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
65	He maintained good, detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.
65	Most importantly, this was a seamless transaction to the customer.
65	Again, thanks for the help.
66	Whoa, that is way too high for yesterday.
66	Please hold the presses before this gets billed to us.
67	Amy, I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.
67	It is so late in the year, that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have "lost" the first part of this year, as I was training (myself).
67	There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.
67	To that end, Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas, learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.
67	Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need, while they get my experience in Services, training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.
67	These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.
67	I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.
67	I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone, and I will revisit this issue in Feb. This compromise seems reasonable.
67	I have asked that this be committed to writing, so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.
67	Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason: they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
67	This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the "back corner."
67	The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.
67	A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him, then he has them sent home.
67	I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.
67	One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.
67	This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.
67	This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors, but I will not be any part of it.
67	I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.
67	If we dont get buy in from the top, I will also be at risk of going home.
67	Some of these guys just dont get it.
67	There are, however, many positives to staying here: the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.
67	They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.
67	I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.
67	Well, thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.
67	My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
67	Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.
67	If you have any thoughts or advice, please share, as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.
67	Later,
68	Always up for coffee!
69	good thought, I sent a separate e-mail to Tim Belden, Greg Wolfe and Geir's supervisor Bill Williams III.
70	Chris, I think we already discussed this issue but let me summarize what I think happened: we were parking 50 mw's with COB.
70	We sold 50 to Reliant/HLP, but the transmission got cut.
70	3 mw's flowed on Oasis 9337 to Reliant.
70	We show in the system that we are purchasing 50 mw's from COB and selling them 47.
70	So, I dont think that we needed to bookout 3 mw's with HLP.
70	They received 3 mw's from City of Bryan on deal #625291.
70	You entered a bookout purchase on deal #625352.
70	Oasis also shows that 3 mw's flowed on #9337.
70	So once again, we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need.
70	Did you negotiate this with HLP?
70	Is this what happened?
70	I'll talk to you about this tonight.
70	Thanks, MW
71	Lisa, I will be out of the office for one half day on Friday and a full day on Monday.
71	Can you list my Monday time as my floating holiday?
71	I will obviously not be able to attend the meeting at 3pm, but I am available by cell.
72	cool, I can meet for coffee anytime.
72	Lunch is tough, but I will keep in touch.
72	Thanks,
73	I have one half day of vacation tomorrow and I'm out on Monday.
73	As you can see, I am still a slacker.
73	No, really we havent been anywhere since we moved back in January.
73	we are going to Austin this weekend to play some golf.
73	Houston is not that scenic, so I'm heading out.
74	I am very interested and I will be available at any time for training.
75	Hey, what's the latest in the service world?
75	I am working with Tom May on services in Ercot in addition to my Ercot ISO duties.
75	How does the price cap crap work?
75	Does this have opportunity for us on the service side or does this kick us in the face?
76	Lloyd, Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision?
76	We should express that we want to hire internally, however, we do have external candidates that we are considering.
76	The Reliant guy, Ryan Thomas, was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove.
76	I believe that HR has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at Reliant.
76	Also, EES is petitioning Kevin for me to let Watt's go right now.
76	I have indicated to Terry Donavan that mid July would be preferable due to our being already short staffed.
76	Let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.
76	I will be out of the office for half day Friday and all day on Monday.
76	Thanks!
77	talking with bryan right now.
77	done before weekend.
78	Greetings - I have attached the most basic expectations for our group.
78	We have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately, and the attached will relieve some of this, so we can focus on trading.
78	I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling.
78	Also, make an effort to know why we run reports, etc. so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation.
78	I will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes.
78	We have a good group and we will do well in the new market.
78	However, this will take an extra effort from each of us.
78	If you have questions about any of the expectations, ask.
78	That is why we make the list.
78	Thanks,
79	CHECK IT OUT.
79	IF YOU TRADE DAYS WITH ANYONE, MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A SIMILAR SKILLSET.
79	IE, DONT TRADE WITH THE NEW GUY TO FILL A NIGHT SHIFT ALONE.
79	THANKS!
80	Thank you,
81	Find the attached files and links:
82	Yes I can.
82	I have already started working on this.
82	Chris Watts will help me get this sorted out ultimately.
82	Sorry for the imbalance.
82	You should see drastic improvement from our side effective immediately.
82	Have a good weekend.
83	Chris, I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes, but was unsuccessful.
83	I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.
83	Enpower is out of balance and the books are as well.
83	Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced, as we cannot tie out with our customers.
83	We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status, then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in. You mention inadvertancy in your Notes, but I dont know the particulars of this problem.
83	I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.
83	If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift, then you should be in balance when you leave.
83	The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.
83	Give me a call to straighten this out.
84	Lloyd, This is the guy I was talking about last week.
84	Kevin seemed to think he would be good on the retail side.
84	I can answer any questions that may arise, or , I can put you in touch with Saji.
84	Thanks,
85	Please see the attached list.
85	If you have questions, please call.
85	Thanks,
86	Alex, Please see the logon for the "traditional" Ercot oasis listed below.
86	Use this login until the Ercot ISO is in effect.
87	You have been invited to attend a team building outing that is sponsored by the Service Desk.
87	Game time is usually around 7:05 pm and we will be having drinks at Cabo around 5 pm.
87	I hope that you can make it.
87	Let me know by this Friday, June 6th, whether you will attend.
87	Thanks, Lets party
88	We have created a quick quide to do QSE trades through the Ercot Portal.
88	This initial guide should get you started, however, this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation.
88	I am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the Portal.
88	As you have noticed, our counterparties have already started trading two hours out.
88	We will be trading paralell until the ISO rolls out for Friday.
88	This means that you will have to submit the "traditional" Ercot Oasis and also submit the QSE trade.
88	We must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching QSE trades, as well.
88	Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot.
88	A copy of our QSE quide will be in your inbox.
88	Make sure that you read/ study it and ASK QUESTIONS.
88	Thanks,
89	Chris, Good questions: 1.
89	You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.
89	Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.
89	If we wish to schedule mw's across a path, ie South to North, we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.
89	We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission, rather, this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
89	Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.
89	I will let you know what it is called.
89	2.
89	The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
89	My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.
89	We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet, as Real Time has done for MDEA.
89	The location for this spreadsheet is: We will request access to this tool for everyone.
89	Thanks,
90	Dave, its good to hear from you.
90	We are in Houston and its hot!
90	My wife is doing great and we are still trying to get used to life in Houston.
90	I am trading in Ercot region (Texas) and, of course, Brett is now working at the ISO.
90	MY WIFE AND I MISS PORTLAND Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.
90	There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors.
90	So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.
90	Everyone that I've met from SRP has been very nice, (Perry, John Sullivan, etc.).
90	Hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family.
91	Bobby, I came really, really close to coming back to Portland.
91	I was recently asked to help get the Ercot (TEXAS) region off of the ground by organizing, training and motivating the Real Time group.
91	I declined initially, as I had previously turned this job down from Portland.
91	I came to Houston to trade cash.
91	Bait and Switch.
91	Anyway, I was looking to return to PDX to work in Mid Mkt or Services, wherever I could have an impact (positive impact, jackie).
91	Once I expressed to Houston that my bags were packed, more opportunity presented itself; I am going to get experience in managing our assets in Texas.
91	We have an agreement with Teco to manage a 480 mw combined cycle facility in South Texas.
91	We have some other interesting arrangements as well.
91	I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.
91	Good, solid technical guy.
91	These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this, I agreed to finish the rest of the year in Houston and get this thing up and running.
91	Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.
91	Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
91	I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well.
91	For all of its sound, fury and ego's the Houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale.
91	My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.
91	My gut tells me that if I stay with the company, I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.
91	Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.
91	No boat anymore, I'm bumming a ride with my friends.
91	Later,
92	Dave, I should have been more specific; Brett is working at the Ercot ISO, near Austin Texas.
92	His e-mail address is below.
92	Thanks,
93	My desk is available for training purposes at night or weekends.
93	However, I am missing my notebook and my tradelog.
93	Frequently things are moved and I have a hard time finding such items as listed above.
93	If you use my desk and you need to move my notebook, etc. then place them in my desk drawer or somewhere else that makes sense.
93	Thanks,
94	You are done on those dates.
94	Thanks for being specific.
94	Sorry that Johnny had not spoken with me, but it will work out okay.
94	It seemed like you were needing some additional days off in July?
94	Is that right?
94	Hope your training with Errigo went well this weekend.
95	This is good info to know.
96	Smitty, I havent been aware that we were to be "on notice" and ready to submit practice schedules to ISO.
96	This is a great training opportunity.
96	Are we supposed to be ready today and if yes, for what?
97	Ercot hourly will need four tickets for thursday's game.
97	The attendees: Eric Saibi Alex McElreath Myself Steve Olinde Thanks,
98	Tom, I am available: July 11th & 12th.
98	July 23-27th.
98	Also the 30th & 31st.
98	I am available most anytime in Augie, as I havent put together the shift schedule yet.
99	I will be out of the office this Friday, next Monday and Tuesday.
99	I will be taking some vacation days.
99	I will be checking in and I will be available by cell phone.
99	thanks,
100	I agree and will make the arrangements.
101	Tony, My logon and password : Thanks,
102	Check out this site.
102	Dont look for job opportunities, however.
103	Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures.
103	Now we need to run this by Teco.
103	Should I call Frank Busot to discuss, or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday?
103	We have already received their invoice for June and they have again invoiced us at the sales price, rather than the minimum market price.
103	I will be involving Clint in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side.
103	What do you think?
104	Can you price a flight for me to Tampa that would leave from Hobby airport?
104	The meetnig is on Tuesday and I could leave either Monday night or Tuesday morning.
104	I could take an afternoon flight from Tampa to Houston Hobby.
104	Thanks,.
105	Brett, I have a business question, for a change.
105	Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.
105	The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.
105	I know that there is South to North congestion, but is this actual load right?
105	Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?
105	Any help you can give would be appreciated.
105	I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.
105	I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.
105	Thanks,
106	Please make the following arrangements for me in order to join Tom and Jeff in Tampa for the Teco meeting: 7/16 - Depart Hobby to Tampa at 7:50pm flight.
106	Stay at Hyatt - Jeff Miller has made the arrangements already.
106	7/17 - Depart Tampa 4:30, arrive Houston 6:35pm.
106	I will be calling on Friday to check on this.
106	Remember, I will be on vacation Friday and Monday.
106	I was scheduled to take Tuesday off, but I will have to attend this meeting.
106	Please do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday.
106	Thanks,
107	Thanks for remembering me.
107	Hope everythnig is well with you too!
108	Lloyd, a couple of questions: Will Joe Capasso be aggreeable to start in my group on August 1st?
108	That would be awesome.
108	Let me know if I can help with anything on this What is the status of the personal best award recommendation for Errigo and Olinde?
108	Thanks,
109	Please use the following: Office - 813-228-4907 (should roll over to his cell after hours) second line in home: 813-634-7772 We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.
109	He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.
109	In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.
109	They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.
109	The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.
110	Lloyd, here is another Bryan guy.
110	Pretty much the same length of service as Kevin.
111	Stephanie McHargue will be backing up Jerry Watson this weekend.
111	She will be another contact person available to us if we cannot contact Jerry.
111	Her numbers: cell: 813-293-0700 home: 727-522-6741 pager: 813-266-8044 Remember to call her this weekend with any Frontera changes.
111	Thanks,
112	Alex doesnt have access to Lotus Notes.
112	Can we get a request in for him?
112	We use Notes to communicate within the Scheduling and RT groups.
112	Thanks,
113	From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.
113	If you recognize someone from another firm, or know who they are, do not discuss their interest in Enron with anyone else.
113	Recently, we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with Enron.
113	Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.
113	Totally unacceptable.
113	I have to ensure that this information is not coming from my group, hence this note.
113	Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.
113	If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.
113	Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.
114	Steve, Check this out- does this have any truth to it?
115	Corry, Can you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?
115	Also, please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services.
115	Additionally, Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately, East Power Scheduling Discussion.
115	Jeff Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.
115	Thanks,
116	Lloyd, I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns.
116	Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him, inquiring about job opportunities here.
116	Steve did mention to Dan that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.
116	He was not specific.
116	Dan, evidently, figured who this was (not very hard) and spread the word at the COB office.
116	Subsequently, Dan and Brandon sent their resumes.
116	I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.
116	I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.
116	Clearly, this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.
116	How do you feel about this: if we hire Kevin, then this problem somewhat goes away.
116	I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in, similar to Alex.
116	I know that Kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program, but I am needing some help pretty quick.
116	Let me know - sorry for the very awkward situation.
117	Had to copy you on this......dont be offended, my friend is from Shreveport.
118	Jerry, Take a look and check to see if I missed anything.
118	Also, I would assume that you have some additional energy to sell for hour ending 7&8 and he 22.
118	Is that true?
118	Thanks,
119	Jerry, Lets try this one:
120	I am scheduled to be out of the office for a few days in late August.
120	The dates are specifically 8/22, 23 and 24th.
120	Thanks,
121	Lloyd, Do you have time to meet with George at noon today?
121	I am going to talk with him again at this time.
122	Michael, how do you know which deals are the options if they are entered as forwards?
122	I input into the comments, but I was about to ask how these options get trued up.
122	Thanks,
123	Hour ending 3 for 5 mw's has been confirmed with HLP.
123	HE 3 was 60 mw's originally, but was cut intra hour.
123	The integrate mw's are 10mw'w and are reflected on revised oasis request 4405.
123	HLP agrees with this.
124	Amy, How's it going?
124	I was wondering how Jeremy was doing.
124	Is there anything I can help with on an "unofficial" basis?
124	It would seem that he has a decision to make, though I havent heard of his progress lately.
124	Did you have your vacation yet?
125	Lloyd, George has departed for his planned vacation.
125	He will be back on the 30th, per his voice mail.
125	I bring him in at that time.
126	Please see the attached that weve discussed.
126	Please note what is contained on the sheets on the bottom of the tool.
126	Thanks,
127	We must notify the Control room (GENCO) personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.
127	For example, when we have availability, or even "must sell" situations off of Frontera, the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.
127	They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem.
127	They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending) that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in. For now, you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.
127	Of course, you can just knock on the door.
127	In Ercot only, we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.
127	No other region has this capability.
127	Thanks,
128	Pete, Do me a favor; e-mail me your question and I'll work to get an "official" answer.
128	Remember that although we will get an answer, the invoice may appear somewhat different.
128	Of course, the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive.
128	Thanks,
129	The internet address for the Ercot Portal:
130	Samuel, Please add the following names to the list of traders that have access to the new Ercot Imbalance and EPMI Ercotpool counterparties: Eric Saibi Alex McElreath Joe Errigo Steve Olinde Joe Capasso Jeff Miller We will need to add more in the near future.
130	Please let me know when this is completed.
130	Thanks,
131	George, Give me a call and we will further discuss opportunities on the 13st floor.
131	Thanks,
132	When do you want to come?
132	The wife and I are expecting you and Richter this week.
132	I will be working some nasty hours this week due to the new market opening.
132	Let me know.....
133	Lloyd, We received this from Preston.
133	Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us.
133	We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston.
133	I am going to discuss this with Narsimha.
133	I feel like a reply is warranted, as we are making no headway on this project.
133	I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.
134	Lloyd, FYI
135	Rogers, Customers call quite often to inquire about Retail Service.
135	Is there a single contact person that we can transfer them to?
135	I talk to someone different each time from EES.
135	I'd like to get a procedure in place for the floor so no one gets lost frmo the outside.
135	Let me know what you think,
136	Hourly deals should be under Teco SVC the majority of the time.
136	However, at times Enron's option (under Ercot Asset book) will be long into the Real Time market.
136	This is Frontera generation, but Enron bought it in the form of the option.

138	Lloyd, I received this from Preston.
138	It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch.
138	We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide.
138	We havent received the necessary information, so no choice has been made yet.
138	Please see the attached and let me know your comments.
139	Scott, I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.
139	Are you planning on playing on Saturday in the morning or afternoon?
139	How many people do you have in the group?
140	See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.
140	We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the OOM (Out of Merit) decrease for today.
140	It is our understanding, per the protocols, that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35 scheduled sale whole.
140	We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of: the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.
140	If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive: $35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.
140	For the capacity tomorrow, We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.
140	The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.
140	The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed.
140	At the time of deployment, we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised.
140	We bid in a Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ". They can take partial hours, at their option. I hope this helps. Director, EPMI
141	Jerry, Please disregard the explanation of the OOM power settlement.
141	The ISO called us at 7:15 pm and explained a different scenario altogether.
141	We need to discuss this further.
141	Sorry for the confusion.
142	Ben, Could you come by, I have a question about rearranging our phone turrets.
142	Thanks,
143	Scott, The wife is out of town until Saturday night.
143	I can play alot of golf on Saturday, but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.
143	I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday.
143	I have one player for Saturday morning, but I dont have a player for Sat.
143	afternoon yet, although I have another co-worker who is interested.
143	Should I fill this spot as well?
144	youre an animal
145	cant even go to the head.
145	thanks for the offer anyway.
146	Ben, as discussed, please move the four Ercot lines to the front page for the listed people below.
146	Also, to the extent possible, add the E lines.
146	These guys are prioritized as follows: John Forney Eric Saibi Steve Olinde Joe Capasso (new to group) Alex McElreath Jeff Miller Smith Day Joe Errigo
147	I purchased a gas deal, 10,000 mmbtud - HSC for 7/10-7/31 for $3.15.
147	I bought this through Doug G-S.
147	Wont you take the final prints for each day and calc profitability for me, or how do you do this?
147	Please give me some money
148	HOW WAS THE TRADITION COURSE?
148	ARE YOU GOLFED OUT YET?
148	I DIDNT DO ANYTHING SATURDAY NIGHT.
149	Rebecca, We have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high.
149	We will discuss this with you.
149	We definitely dont want to talk to Teco/Frontera until we get a handle on this.
149	We will come by this afternoon.
150	I left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question.
150	Could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail?
150	If I cannot answer the question, then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep. The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.
150	This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.
150	Let me know what you have.
151	Johnny, What is the status of George?
151	I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.
151	George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.
151	I would think not, at this time.
151	Lloyd is out of town until Monday, so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.
151	Thanks,
152	Johnny, I just received this from Lloyd.
152	I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR, so you might want to check with Kim.
152	Thanks!
153	Mark, I called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message........sorry about that - we had a trading issue in the middle of my conversation with you.
153	Anyway, I received the following question from some of our Retail folks.
153	If you could help answer this question I would really appreciate it.
153	Jeff Miller and I are planning to visit Austin next Friday to discuss Settlements.
153	We look forward to meeting you.
153	Are you a golfer?
153	We may try to play Friday afternoon.
154	Here you go: There is no banking mechanism.
154	If A&B are net long, they receive the balancing energy price for all of their mw's.
154	If C & D are short, then their short position is covered by the Ercot ISO; C & D are charged the balancing energy price plus replacement reserve /mw.
154	If the money, at the end of the day, is insufficient to pay A&B, then this full cost will be allocated on a load share ratio basis.
154	This charge will be allocated under the UFE (unaccounted for energy) charge type.
154	If C & D serve load, then they will share the expense of paying for the balancing energy price to A & B. A & B escapes this expense allocation, as they do not serve load.
155	Kim, Keenon has been recommended to Doug as a possiblity in RT.
155	I think our roster has been filled out, however, I had promised this guy an interview before I knew that Lloyd had lifted some people.
155	Can we schedule an interview with Keenon, as I think that he is a strong prospect.
155	I will send you a copy of his resume via office mail.
155	He can be reached at 713-410-2255.
155	Please let me know what you think.
155	Thanks,
156	Doug, I am planning on attending this settlements deal; we plan on meeting Mark Patterson there.
156	[Forney, John M.] I am planning on attending
157	Rebecca, pls see the attached for our expectation of imbalance for 8/2.
158	Ercot is now requiring that we fill out and fax the attached form to them when we have imported/exported across one of the DC ties.
158	The file is located in: Please update tag number, megawatts (positive for exports, negative for imports), and total number of schedules.
159	Thanks Lance, I have a question: on the Ercot transmission outage page, the TU Bellmead station is listed as having trouble - the buss is damaged due to storm.
159	Is this the reason that there are TU CSC's, as mentioned on the Ercot conference call?
159	The station is to be out until August 10th.
159	We have had a significant price split and I think that this might be the specific reason.
159	I have tried powerworld, but I couldnt turn off this station.
159	What do you think?
160	Attention: The Ercot ISO has been settling our trades scheduled to the North by giving us the West or South Balancing Energy price.
160	We have officially disputed this allocation, as we believe that we would, at most, incur a load deviation imbalance in the North zone (to be settled in the North).
160	Again, a purchase in the South scheduled to our load in the North is receiving the South or West prices.
160	We are awaiting Ercot's explanation.
160	Until further notice, do not schedule energy from the South or West to the North.
160	You may still engage in intrazonal, or same zone, trades (QSE to QSE ).
160	What IS permitted is imported from outside Ercot into the North zone.
160	The DC tie is in the North and we should stay aggressive, working with the SPP team to secure transmission to and from Ercot.
160	When in doubt, wake me up.
160	Update: At 6 pm, our Rep from Ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the NORTH price.
160	However, I still cannot accept his answer as the gospel, as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy.
160	I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water, but for now: EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!
161	NEVER FEED STRAY ANIMALS - THEY KEEP COMING BACK
162	We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.
162	Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera.
162	We should have balancing bids in for all hours, but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours.
162	We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.
162	Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.
162	This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."
162	We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.
162	If this situation happens, we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.
162	This is an important part of the Services side of our business, and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.
162	If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'
163	Lloyd, Do you want to answer George's questions, or do you want me to handle this?
164	Samuel, The traders listed above are not valid in Enpower as traders under the following books: Ercot Hourly Teco Services Please have them added asap, or if you could, let me know who is responsible for making this change.
164	Thanks Samuel,
165	Take a look at this, add or format ( add to letterhead, etc) as necessary.
165	Let me know what you think.
166	I will not be in the office on Thursday or Friday.
166	I will be attending a meeting in Austin.
167	I will be attending Ercot meetings in Austin Thursday and Friday of this week.
167	I can be reached by cell phone.
167	Thanks,
168	Please see the attached Thanks,
169	doing well in the book.
169	spread options coming in well, real time going very well.
169	same old stuff.
169	very much deja vu.
169	golf is very good, as I get to play more often.
169	how is it going for you?
170	I can meet with Keenon today or tomorrow.
170	I will be out of the office Wed-Fri.
170	Thanks,
171	1.00 PM IS FINE
172	Ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain: Sometimes when we are submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal, the Day-ahead schedules are affected.
172	Mismatches for every counterparty occur.
172	We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour.
172	Eric Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.
172	I called Ercot and after some time, they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.
172	Attached below is the ticket number related to this problem.
172	If this occurs again, make sure that you reference this number.
172	Thanks,
173	Erik, I will be available earlier than 5:30 for an informal discussion.
173	I will be in the office Monday and Tuesday of this week.
173	I will be out the remainder of the week on vacation.
173	Let me know if this works.
174	George, I have been out of the office on Ercot business since Thursday of last week.
174	Sorry for the delay.
174	Lloyd and I would like for your start date to be on September 1st, if possible .
174	Actually, two weeks notice would fall on September 3rd, I believe.
174	Thanks,
175	David, we often trade with EPMI, as they may be the best bid on any given day.
175	So, the language should apply.
176	Today would be fine.
176	Between 12-1pm.
176	I can sit with you for an informal meeting and see where it goes.
176	I am located at 3111e.
176	Thanks,
177	That is fine.
178	WAS THIS NOT CANCELLED?
179	Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?
179	I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved.
179	We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.
179	What more is there?
179	I have heard that this could start as early as September, but we are still a bit short on detail.
179	If we started in September, I would envision passing local charges, congestion, etc to EES.
179	We would schedule your hedges, your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone.
179	We would provide scheduling services, settlements and 24 hour coverage to handle any contingencies that might occur.
179	I look forward to working with you on this issue.
179	Give me a call when you get a chance.
179	Thanks,
180	I played the last four days: barton creek in Austin ColoVista in Bastrop (near Austin) Fish Creek Fish Creek yesterday.
180	I am hitting the ball alot better and starting to make some putts.
180	I wont be around this weekend, as I am vacationing down in South Padre Island for the next few days.
180	We need to take that boat out so I can show you around Galveston.
180	Fishing is good and you can pull up to certain restaraunts on the water.
180	Let me know when you wanna go.
181	We have not scheduled this load as of yet.
181	I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s.
181	and get at least a rudimentary plan in place.
181	Here it is: By 7am - EES submits to us their load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially.
181	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies Wholesale settlement provided, ancillary service charges , local congestion, etc is to be passed to EES.
181	Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start at the latest.
181	We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.
181	We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges.
181	We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.
182	Scott, I dont get discounted tickets, but occasionally someone will offer them for sale on the e-bulletin board.
182	I'll keep an eye out for you.
183	Kim, Havent talked to you for awhile.
183	Hope everything is going well.
183	I do have a question about who will be doing my review.
183	Also, dont we still have a rating system?
183	I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it.
183	Also, is it possible for me to review my personel file?
183	Is this within company policy?
183	Lastly, can you provide to me a copy of my contract?
183	Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.
183	Thank you for your time.
184	Perfect.
184	Thanks.
184	I can review the folder anytime this week.
184	Thanks again
185	sorry for the delay in providing feedback; i have been out of the office.
185	the confirms look good and I am ok with sending them out.
185	if you have any questions, give me a call
186	what is the latest with you?
186	i talked with wolfey the other day and wished him well.
186	i'm sure that our paths will cross again some day.
186	also josh bengson called me yesterday.
186	it was good to hear from him - he is doing well.

187	Sorry to hear about the Wolf departure.
187	have you bought that guitar yet?
188	Mikey, Where are you?
189	We are doing a good job in deal entry accuracy.
189	I have had few instances where I am asked by Risk Mgmt to troubleshoot problems, as had been the case the previous months.
189	GOOD JOB !
189	Please stay focused on this
190	Lloyd, Frontera needs a portal so that they may submit outage schedules for their plant.
190	We, as the QSE, arent able to submit this, per Protocols.
190	Thanks,
191	Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.
191	We had submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium because the unit was offline.
191	In the Resource Plan, we can attach a premium for OOM up or down.
191	In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline".
191	The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.
191	Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.
191	We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.
191	Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13, to control congestion.
191	They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
191	I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep., and I explained the situation.
191	I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.
191	I also wanted to know how this would settle.
191	His reply is as follows: Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant, that changed our status from unavailable to available.
191	Since we had an implied low premium (zero) on our plant, we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
191	We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.
191	The mcp was low all day ( mid teens) yesterday.
191	If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs, we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.
191	We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available with a $50 premium.
191	This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.
191	The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.
191	Please review this to understand why this applies.
191	This was a very educational process.
191	We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly" we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.
191	Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented: If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.
191	Say the unit is NOT available.
191	If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums: $50 premium for OOM up.
191	$10 premium for OOM down.
191	These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
191	If we are OOM'd up, the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.
191	If we are OOM'd down, then we should be paid the mcp + premium.
191	Please call me if you have questions, Director, Enron Ercot Region
192	Hello, George.
192	1.
192	The actual shift change occurs at 6 am until further, however, I expect traders to arrive at least 20 minutes before shift change.
192	2 the September work schedule is attached 3.
192	I understand that most park in daily fee, "outside" lots.
192	Thanks,
193	Jerry, Please see the attached:
194	Cant - I have friends coming in from Calgary.
194	I went to a great course yesterday; Glenloch Farms is not too far from the Woodlands and was a cool layout.
194	We will have to go when I get free.
195	Carmen, Please note that my employee's correct name is Alex McElreath.
195	It was mispelled below.
195	Thank you,
196	We were down balanced in excess of what we were willing to pay, as indicated by our bidding structure.
196	It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids.
196	Our Ercot Rep, Mark Patterson is looking into this.
196	We will dispute down balancing bills for the labor day weekend, as this problem persisted every day.
196	Thanks,
197	Please see the attached:
198	Jerry, Please see tomorrow's schedules as attached:
199	Boy: the deal number for the coa option for tomorrow is 765595.1.
199	do you need this????
200	Hourly Ercot is long 65 mw's for hour ending 6.
200	We have this routed to North Zone load.
200	If prices appear to be heading negative, then export or sell outright.
200	Please review all positions in the system for tomorrow so that you can transact if necessary.
200	Thanks,
201	What again is the $ impact and the days involved that we are discussing.
202	Can we create an inbox folder for Joe?
202	I need to leave something for him tonight and I promised that it would be in his inbox (which he doesnt have) Thanks,
203	Please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction, we will also receive a category one deployment.
203	The unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce.
203	The category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level.
203	These should not be combined .
203	Also, when you receive a category 2, 3 or 4 we are essentially receiving an OOM type instruction that is settled under the OOM provisions.
204	Jerry, please see the attached:
205	Please see the revised game plan for Monday.
205	Notice that hour ending 6 has been revised upward.
205	Thanks,
206	We have purchased 65 mw's from Teco for hour ending 6 on Monday for $5.
206	This is scheduled into the North Zone.
206	If prices dictate, sell to another counterparty.
206	See deal no.
206	767454 Thanks,
207	correct
208	comments (negative) from Frank before the end of day?
208	I am willing to bet $5 Want some?
209	Thanks - Good job in documentation
210	They are members of the RT group, so they will sit at the "rotating seat" of 3111f.
210	They will have the same access as Steve Olinde, Joe Capasso, etc. Can we copy the profiles of existing team members?
211	que paso, pawpaw
212	Jerry, Please see the attached:
213	Joe, I need some help on the schedule for September 20th.
213	Steve Olinde is on vacation this day.
213	I intended to cover for him, but I am now trading the dailies for Frontera.
213	I will not be able to cover the RT shift.
213	I know that you are working alot of days before then, but I would appreciate your help.
213	Thanks,
214	Please see the attached work schedule for Sept. I have you officially joining the group on Wednesday, however, your actual shift work begins on Thursday, September 13th.
214	If you have any questions, give me a call at 3-7160.
214	We look forward to having you on the team.
215	We are long 65 mw's from Frontera at $5 for tomorrow.
215	It is scheduled into the North 2001.
215	Sell if needed.
216	Jerry see the attached.
216	Ercot has your direct line (cell) for down balancing today.
216	We are evacuating.
216	My cell number is 713-412-7529 Call me if you need anything.
216	Thanks!
217	How many spots does the Ercot RT group have for the LV trip in October?
218	Thanks for your reply.
218	Here's what I have learned from our conversation: Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers, my spots were "captured" by Don and Juan's group?
218	I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls, but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
218	I expected to be able to include my employees, as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.
218	Don and Juan have invited my employee, Steve Olinde, with one of my original spots.
218	He will attend.
218	I am not trying to give you a hard time, but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?
219	Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.
219	If I can assist with this accounting, let me know.
219	I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.
219	In the future, I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group.
219	I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.
219	I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.
219	We werent able to secure a commitment from customers, but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).
219	I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip did not change, rather the allocation to each group was changed.
219	My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything.
219	But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank, profitability and that I have been here 8 years.
219	I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.
220	Frontera is long hour ending 7-11 by 5 mw';s.
220	This has been scheduled into the North 2001 zone on behalf of Teco Services.
220	Please sell this power for > $5, if possible.
220	Use your judgement - let me know if you have questions.
220	Please cut the imbalance deal and replace with the new sale.
220	Thanks,
221	Jerry - My trader, Eric, was able to sell the he 7-11 5 mw's for $14.
221	Please see the attached:
222	thanks BOYYYYYYYYYYY
223	scrub yourself down
224	Jerry, Please see the attached spreadsheet for tomorrow.
224	We booked you out on the Enron option for $22.25.
224	So, we are selling you next day for $22.25.
224	Also, to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.
224	This should get you flat for the day.
224	We will not run tomorrow, as of now.
224	We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline.
225	I have entered an annuity from Doug's book to Paul's to account for imbalance losses due to the September 11th tragedy.
225	Annuity number 774083, dated 9/12 will transfer a total of $67,530.15.
225	See the attached spreadsheet.
226	I have a 1:10 t time for Windrose on Sat.
226	I have a 3:1 coupon that will reduce the expense to $51 pp + tax.
226	Let me know if you can go.
227	We are short the following schedule to Stec: If you fill this schedule, reduce the purchase that is in the Portal and replace with the new source.
227	Thanks,
228	Erik, deal no.
228	773763 has been changed.
228	sorry for the confusion.
229	Jerry, Please see the attached:
230	We are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday, sunday, and monday.
230	We are floating 55 mw's in the South zone.
230	If you replace this power, please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.
230	Also: The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.
230	We are currently, as of Friday, experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.
230	These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.
230	We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.
230	We have done so.
230	When the other units become available, please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.
230	We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.
230	If you have questions, give me a call.
231	When: Monday, September 17, 2001 11:00 AM-11:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
231	Where: 3112f - Doug's desk
232	Jerry, Please see the attached .
232	As I mentioned, I will be out of the office visiting Ercot tomorrow.
232	Thanks,
233	Frank.
233	The ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible.
233	Non- spinnning for today is, at most, 90 cents/mw for hours 14-18.
233	The remaining hours are worth zero.
233	The down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative at as much as $11.99/mw , but we are not certified for this service.
233	As I understand it, there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement.
233	GE personel were to travel to the plant and do some work, but in light of world events, I do not know if they have arrived.
233	Once the upgrades are complete, we need to restart the certification process with Ercot.
233	If we sell non-spin for .90, we would need to withhold this power from the market.
233	We have been selling, on a Real Time basis, as much power as we can get out the door.
233	We have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules, typically at hour 10 through 22 for a sales price of $24.
233	That is the latest.
233	We are currently looking at making sales in October.
233	The heat rate is around 10.7 Thanks,
234	Please see the attached.
235	Mikey - I heard that you have gotten married.
235	Is that true?
236	just to double check; the meeting is now on Monday, right?
237	Please see the attached.
237	Remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 7 (50 mw's).
237	So, we wont actually generate 250's as the schedule indicates.
237	Alex will take care of this tonight.
237	Prices for the weekend look like: gas $2.06 This doesnt look too good for the weekend run.
237	Let me know what you need to do.
237	Thanks,
238	For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.
238	This is what is communicated to Frontera.
238	The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.
238	The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.
238	Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.
238	The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.
238	Please familiarize yourself with this report The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales, etc. Additionally, the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.
238	For example, if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's, we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3 do not exceed this amount.
238	Otherwise, Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.
238	Specifically for tomorrow, please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.
238	The plant doesnt like to do this.
238	A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
238	So either : 1.
238	purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.
238	Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.
238	Put purchase from in Teco Services book.
238	Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.
238	If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
238	2.
238	have plant drag and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.
238	No entries will be needed.
238	Call if you have questions.
239	For Monday, it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera: Also, we need to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.
239	We are not running the plant this weekend.
239	The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
239	We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
239	Also, please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.
239	FYI - for OOM up, we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.
239	For this weekend assume $2.05.
239	IF you can make hourly, bal-day sales in excess of this, check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.
239	Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend for economics.
239	We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.
239	I will be out of town this weekend.
239	I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.
239	Thanks,
240	We are long 100 mw's for hour ending 16-19 on Monday.
240	This is currently scheduled to load.
240	If prices are poor, we need to sell this energy early Monday morning for > $22 if possible.
240	The sale goes into the Ercot Asset book.
240	Thanks,
241	The position for Monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the QSE MOS and Enpower.
241	Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases.
241	Attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what Frontera is doing for the next three days.
241	Again, look to the top line to know what generation output should be.
241	Know it, learn it, live it.
241	Thanks,
242	Laurel, Do you have Ken Parker's e-mail address?
242	He needs to be copied on our preschedules.
242	His address is kbparker@tecoenergy.com Thanks,
243	For tomorrow, we need to sell the following: The sales go into the Teco Services book.
243	The length is currently scheduled to load in Enpower and the QSE MOS system.
243	Thanks,
244	Additionally,
245	Mark, Hope all is well in Taylor.
245	I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.
245	As discussed in our meeting, I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm) from Terry at the ISO.
245	He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday, Sept 14th.
245	We were, indeed, exercised on Friday.
245	I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.
245	However, we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion, as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.
245	The replacement reserve prices have been zero.
245	Could you provide some help on this?
245	Thanks,
246	Andrea, apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.
246	I show negative new deal value for Teco Services, when I sold above the curve on their behalf.
246	I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.
246	The deal has been revised, as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.
246	This imbal.
246	sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.
246	Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?
247	Ken, Laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on.
247	I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution.
247	I will be out of the office next week.
247	Clint Dean will step in for me.
247	Thanks,
248	I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.
248	He asked me one day: " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in taxes?"
248	I told both of them (laughing) that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that, since they didnt enter any contest.
248	They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.
248	I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.
248	The jackass scam artist called them back, bitching that they had cancelled their check.
248	My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
248	He tried to reinstate the check , but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.
248	He was going to do this again, but I told his in-laws, friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.
248	He finally saw the light.
248	Just doing my job.
248	Anyway, this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.
248	He works at the Harris county courthouse.
248	His wife ran off with a crack head, left him with the kids, didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.
248	The divorce was in Liberty where this woman, also a dumbass friend from wayback, had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.
248	She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.
248	Life is less fair to dumbasses
249	good to hear from you - everything is still pretty wild up here, but it is going very well.
249	Sorry to hear about the neighbors, but i think that you will enjoy living downtown.
249	there is so much to do here now.
249	how are your hours now?
249	im sure that they are pretty scary.
249	seen any good bands lately?
250	im sorry - im kinda shifty............
251	Hello, I am using MSN dial up through the Enron program.
251	I understood it to be a $5 co-pay.
251	MSN customer service has said that they are billing me $25/month for this service and they dont know anything about an Enron special program.
251	Who can I contact to resolve this issue?
251	John Forney Director, Ercot Power Trading
252	Yes, My member id is fourknees .
252	I am being billed $21.95/ month since inception of May 11, 2001.
252	Thanks for your help.
253	My cell phone 713-412-7529 home number 281-419-4388 Deb's cell 281-767-3667 catcha later,

255	We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.
255	We want to remain that way, unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.
255	We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled.
255	Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.
255	This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day, etc. Thanks,
256	FYI, This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.
256	Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.
256	I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.
256	We ran at 280, but our resource plan was not updated.
256	Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.
256	It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.
256	The point is, the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.
256	We must reflect our true minimums at all times.
256	If the situation changes intraday, we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.
256	Please see the e-mail below from Alan.
257	Until further, it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market.
257	The downside is $1000 and the upside maybe $10.
257	Thanks,
258	Steve indicated below that he talked to Ken at Frontera.
258	Ken Parker is the "new" Jerry.
258	They are staffing up.
259	the file should be m:electric/eservices/ees/ercot/ees model go get em,
260	Can I get a change in Enpower?
260	We have done this type thing on the West desk: For every counterparty "Ercot Imbalance" , I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to "off" automatically.
260	When this manual process does not get done, we have settlement problems.
260	What do you think?
261	Ken, As discussed earlier, I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.
261	If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule, I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.
261	I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.
261	Basically, you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.
261	The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule - $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point, however, I used this in the analysis.
261	Please let me know what you think.
261	Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.
261	I think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.
261	Additionally, I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.
261	Let me know what you think,
262	Rebecca, For September 28th, we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.
262	We bill them $20, Enpower #794481, for various hours.
262	I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals : Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.
262	(see imbal. # 794516).
262	I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
262	This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.
262	Thanks,
263	Thanks for looking into this.
264	We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.
264	They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow.
264	They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following: So, basically, they will be dragging significantly for these hours.
264	We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price.
264	The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.
264	Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.
264	Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.
264	Thanks,
265	we put it on for tomorrow.
265	i am short the pool at $20.
265	i gave them an agressive bid and i think that we will both win.
266	Tom, Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.
266	I am really excited about getting this product off.
266	I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.
266	Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera: September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.
266	This was a 10.72 heat rate.
266	I had to take off for an Austin trip and Clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact.
266	Power moved down, but so did gas, The heat rate was the same, but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.
266	Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.
266	I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5 heat rate.
266	The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.
266	August (late) - Clint proposed selling 12.7 heat rate in September .
266	They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.
266	This didnt work out.
266	On a daily basis, Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.
266	For example, I give them gas prices and daily prices.
266	They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.
266	I tell them that I will bookout my option.
266	They call back later and say that they would like to run.
266	Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.
266	On Tuesday, I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for a $1.25 premium.
266	This would have at least brought in $23,000.
266	They werent interested in this idea.
266	I communicate my feelings on the market very early.
266	If they could react quicker, I would smack the first bids that showed their faces, including EOL.
266	I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.
266	Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay.
266	He will be sending another e-mail.
266	This relationship, although not initially profitable, has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.
266	I dont really want to lose the job.
266	We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.
266	The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments.
266	The settlements extract, as I learned on my trip, is key to explainnig this value.
266	The OOM value itself is well over $200k.
266	Good luck!
267	In this case, Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.
267	The enpower deals listed below are under this desk.
267	The financial swap info is going out, Frontera being the most logical first customer.
267	Is there anything else from us that you would want?
267	Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera, etc. Let me know what you think.
268	Mark, We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services; Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis.
268	We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.
268	For example, on 9/27, Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.
268	Ercot procured only approx.
268	117 mw's each hour.
268	The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.
268	Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing, etc.?
268	I will be out of the office next week, so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith?
268	His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com.
268	Otherwise, he can be reached at 713-853-9310.
268	Thanks for your help!
269	Larry, I will be on vacation next week.
269	I will not be available until Monday, October 8th.
269	Thanks,
270	I will be on vacation next week.
270	I will be checking in via cell phone.
270	Thanks,.
271	I will be on vacation next week, October 1-5th.
271	In my absence , contact Clint Dean or Smith Day for any questions related to Frontera, etc. Feel free to wake Clint up for any reason.
271	Thanks,
272	I saw the memo.
272	It is true about the startup charges.
272	It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
272	Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?
272	Thanks,
273	Could you tell me what my balance is for vacation days?
273	Also, I dont think that I have signed up for the floating holiday yet.
273	Would this balance reflect that?
273	Thank you!
274	I have received notice that I need to attend the Sandhill board of directors meeting tomorrow.
274	Clint Dean will be trading the Asset book.
274	I will be available via cell phone.
274	Thanks,
275	that is correct
276	Mark, Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.
276	I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
276	Our position is that our custmers, ie.
276	Teco/Frontera should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity, as they are standing by awaiting instruction.
276	Has there been any progress in this subject?
277	Due to the slowdown in trading, I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around.
277	These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.
277	This will make more sense, once you inherit the position.
277	The following positions need to be watched for monday: 1.
277	We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.
277	We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time.
277	They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.
277	This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.
277	If you are working Sunday night, check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.
277	It is very common that they get a bad "handoff" and are unaware of this transaction.
277	Give them plenty of time to work this out.
277	We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X and a sale to Mirant.
277	In Enpower, buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).
277	Enter this as a flat transaction, ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.
277	2.
277	The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.
277	Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.
277	I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.
277	I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.
277	I think also that some larger units are coming off line, which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.
277	Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.
277	Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5, offpeak is trading $11.25.
277	Where is the value???
277	Lets trade it up!
278	Isaac needs to be set up with a certificate for the Ercot Portal.
278	Is there a form I need to fill out for this?
279	Ben, My new employee, Isaac Wong, needs a turret id.
279	He will need to copy someone else's phone list as well.
279	Can you help?
279	Thanks,
280	thanks harley man
281	Kim, I had mentioned that I had not completed submitting my expense for temporary housing, etc. I mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year.
281	Can I still get this in?
281	I think I have everything in order.
281	Thanks,
282	Any luck with the changes we have requested?
283	thanks so much for checking into this for me.
283	sorry for the delay in submitting.
284	So, you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?
284	Good call there.
284	I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.
284	Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap, $165.
284	The weather was awesome and the wine was good ( as far as I can remember ).
284	Anyway, it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.
284	What are you working on here, is it classified?
285	yep, coffee is a good idea.
286	Who would I talk to about the residential customers.
286	I received a call from a load aggregating company that specializes in residential sign ups.
286	This sounds like a good idea, provided that our strategy hasnt changed.
287	What about New Power, should we refer this deal to them?
287	It looks pretty good.
288	Joe, Do you have any record of this deal?
288	I should that you worked this day.
288	If this exists in your personal trade log, then we need to Enpower this.
288	Let me know what you find.
289	Alex, Could you check your trade log for this?
289	I show that you were on this day.
289	If this trade is good, we need to Enpower.
289	Let me know what you find.
290	Joe, Here's another.
290	Please check this out and let me know what's going on.
290	Thanks,
291	Due to Oklaunion being down for maintenance, we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #570719.
291	This 25 mw purchase from Tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 23 and 24 today.
291	Buy the power tonight and enter deal under Ercot Mgmt book, as this is Doug's power.
291	I have already made the cuts in Enpower for both hours ending 23,24 and tomorrow.
291	For tomorrow, I have purchased energy for this schedule, so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis.
291	If you have questions, let me know.
291	Thanks,
292	Alex, You have been somehow entering deals under South America - Brazil region, rather than South 2001.
292	Risk has been having a problem with this.
292	This has also affected the Brazil trading desk.
292	Double check your deal entry desks and zones.
292	I intended to mention this last week and I forgot.
292	It came up again today, per risk.
292	Also, on the hour ending 6 deal today; you should have entered a sale to Frontera in Enpower, rather than Mirant.
292	This is a bit confusing, but here goes: Frontera had sold Mirant this option, not Enron.
292	Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for.
292	I replace this power, or Frontera generates the schedule.
292	If I (or you) replace, then we do enter a schedule of a sale to Mirant in the Portal.
292	But, we dont sell to Mirant in Enpower, as this is not our deal.
292	Instead, the sale goes to Frontera.
292	They pay us to reimburse us for buying LCRA on their behalf.
292	Does that help?
293	Kim, Cammi Mursch has asked for an e-mail from Enron authorizing an extension.
293	Can we do this?
293	Thanks,
294	Linus, can you give me the info for a New Power contact?
295	I have talked with John Phillips with Cinergy Worldwide.
295	His company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the Northeast.
295	They are not related to the Cinergy utility.
295	They are interested in a partnership with Enron/New Power where Cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper/ terms in return for a negotiated fee.
295	He is interested in entering the Texas Choice arena.
295	They claim to be capable of size in signups.
295	I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP.
295	The number for John Phillips is : 410-365-5613 Let me know what your thoughts are.
295	John Forney Ercot Trading
296	The Oklaunion plant is offline until midnight Friday.
296	I have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market.
296	No replacement is needed.
296	Also; You will notice that from peak on through 24, the pool has been strong.
296	Generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day.
296	You can recognize this in the ACE display on the monitor.
296	Notice hour ending 3,4,5.
296	Theyre draggin.
296	Prices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on.
297	Mr. Hinson, Sorry I missed your call.
297	The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.
297	Three units in total, however, the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.
297	I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.
297	There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.
297	These units are behind a common point, so the rules as they were written dont consider us.
297	I know that this is more than you asked for, but for whatever it's worth........
297	Thanks and give me a call if you need more info, Enron Ercot Region
298	Kim, Here is the e-mail address for Cammi.
298	Thanks,
299	We have been having alot of trouble with one of the big screens that is fed by the portal server.
299	It is the display over Doug's head.
299	This shows ACE and load forecast.
299	Doug is very excited about this, as we have had a daily problem It works temporarily , but goes down daily.
299	Is Sasha the guy to talk to on this?
300	best wishes to you and your daughter.
301	The updated help desk numbers for 24 hour call are as follows: These have changed, so update your phone list accordingly.
301	Thanks,
302	The Hourly Ercot book is long 30 mw's at $13.25 for hour ending 23 and 24 on Friday.
302	This is currently scheduled into the North Zone load.
302	When you sell this, cut the load and replace with the appropriate QSE trade.
302	The purchase is in Enpower as #825387.
302	The sale to Ercot Imbal is under #825406.
302	Cut the enpower sale and replace with appropiate sale counterparty.
302	Everything should be entered under the Hourly Ercot desk.
302	Let me know how it goes.
303	Adrianne, I was not able to participate in a phone screen for any of the applicants below, due to business travel.
303	What is the latest on this?
304	Tom, The Frontera file has, in the first tab, their calculation for their daily costing.
304	Ken gave me this and asked me what I think.
304	It would probably be best if we talk some more about it, rather than sending it to Jerry Brown, etc. What do you think?
305	The ST ercot book is long 30 mw's in the offpeak hours for Monday.
305	We would like to sell these mw's at a reasonable price that is left to your judgement.
305	If prices look to be potentially negative, of course, sell the mw's.
305	Give me a call if you have questions, preferrably before 10 pm.
305	Thanks,
306	Give me a call
307	The Resolution desk has given me the password.
307	However, George was not set up in deal blotter under North America, East Region.
307	I have since submitted another E-request for George.
307	The reason is, he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name.
307	Can you watch out for this?
308	William, things look better but, George does not have access to the EPMI Hourly Ercot book.
308	This is the book that he trades primarily.
308	He also needs EPMI Ercot Asset.
308	Thanks,
309	Frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below.
309	I have sold them this imbalance for $28.57.
309	Any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below.
309	The total is 1375.
309	This is the equivalent of a financial swap, but the settlement will remain intact.
309	Thanks,
310	Ken, Take a look at this.
310	We will sell an additional 85mw's for hour ending 2300 tomorrow.
310	This is not on the sheet, obviously.
310	Thanks,
311	Frontera has scheduled the following for tomorrow: We will be required to sell an additional 85 mw's tomorrow for hour ending 23 in order to get up to the minimum run of 135mw's.
311	If Frontera has problems coming up tomorrow, there may be an ACE issue.
311	We will advise.
312	I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.
312	The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).
312	I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.
312	I could buy up to the 300 mw's.
312	Schedule this to load in the North.
312	I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.
312	Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.
312	If you have questions, please give me a call, as this is a very important issue.
312	Words of advice: Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.
312	Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.
312	Do not tip your hand on this deal, as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.
312	Thanks,
313	Karen, I have spoken with Adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process.
313	At that time, I had left messages with all three candidates, but was unable to reach them.
313	Late yesterday afternoon, I received a call from Nicholas Watson.
313	I was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background.
313	He also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at JP Morgan Chase & Co. I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview.
313	I did relay to him that we would contact him within a week.
313	I will again call the other candidates.
314	John, The outage requested for Friday has been approved by Kevin Presto.
314	I am glad to hear that the demin tank situation has been resolved.
314	The meeting that I attended was helpful in understanding your level of frustration.
314	If you have further questions, please let me know.
314	John Forney
315	Greetings: For tonight, Frontera is long 85mw's hour ending 2300.
315	We need to sell this under the Teco Services book.
315	For tomorrow Frontera needs to sell: Enter a purchase from Frontera (Teco services book) enter the same price as you sold for.
315	Enter the sale (Teco Services).
315	I am also selling Frontera 200 mw's for hour ending 7 and 50 mw's hour ending 8.
315	I am selling this position for $26.04.
315	I will be short the Imbalance price during this time.
315	If you can buy below $26.04 for this time period, do so and schedule to load in the South.
315	I am long into the North Zone as follows : I am long under deal #834600 If prices appear to weaken, sell these mw's for 1-6 and cut this Ercot Imbalance deal by same.
315	This deals should be listed under Ercot Asset.
315	Thanks,
316	I have sold Frontera the following: Please transfer this imbalance amount to me.
316	See deal no's 835119 & 835120.
316	Thanks,
317	Yes, I would like that very much.
317	Please give me a call at 3-7160
318	I have spoken with Ruben this morning.
318	He is currently working in Structuring for Sempra, focusing on the Ercot retail market.
318	Additionally, he has worked for the California PX.
318	This and his educational background would have me recommend scheduling an interview with this applicant.
319	thanks, tell these guys to trade it up!
320	This is the public Ercot ISO site.
320	You can query for prices.
320	We have an internal site, the East Power Portal site, which has a section for Price and Load.
320	This scrapes info from the Ercot website.
320	I would think that you need special access to use the link below.
321	A reminder, I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.
321	This has been scheduled into the North Zone.
321	If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.
321	Enpwr deal 834600 is the sale to North Zone.
321	The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's for the offpeak hours at $9.20.
321	The Enpwr deal number is #836534 If you sell hours 1-6, cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.
321	We will leave Additionally, Frontera needs to sell the following: Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.
321	I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).
321	I then pay the pool price.
321	If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours, please cover and schedule to the South Zone The Swap went very well today, since we had a physical position: Although the physical may lose $1500, the financial swap will make $17,000.
321	Here's how it works: When you buy balday, you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool) Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.
321	The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.
321	Call if you have questions.
322	i have zeroed this price out.
322	thanks
323	Save the file attached below to your desktop.
323	You can just click and drag.
323	You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.
323	Make sure that the dates are in the following: To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.
323	The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks, ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.
323	I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
323	I used a similar tool in the California pool.
323	For example, take yesterday and compare to today, same period.
323	Factor in weather, unit outages, etc. This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.
323	Let me know your feedback.
324	I am discussing this with Cara at Tenaska.
324	She is going to send more support for this.
325	Sell hour ending 6 only- 30 mw's for Frontera tomorrow.
325	DO NOT GO TO THE POOL .
325	If you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price ($0 or greater) and the pool appears to be going to a negative, call Jerry and wake him up.
325	Have him ramp up starting he 7.
325	Try to sell tonite if possible, so we wont have to wake them up.
325	I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow.
325	They will be short the following hours: I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.
325	I sell fixed and buy floating.
325	If you think that the pool will be high, then you buy fixed and take to the pool.
325	You will buy fixed and sell floating.
325	Net, we are left with two fixed prices.
325	Very cool.
325	Ercot will be calling due to the ACE issue.
325	The plant will be coming up slowly.
325	Call if you have questions,
326	Frontera is scheduled to generate a total of 400 mw's onpeak.
326	There may be an ace issue for hours ending 7-10.
326	We suspect that Ercot will want us to stay down due to price/lack of load.
326	Check with Real Time trader.
326	Thanks,.
327	Yes, Joe Capasso does report to me.
327	Thanks,
328	Thanks for the info for the additional load.
328	As I understand it, we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.
328	This is great!!
328	Each day I review balancing energy prices vs. daily prices and the choice is extremely simple: We allow the pool to fill this load.
328	I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.
328	There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.
328	Do we need to discuss this further?
328	I just want to be on the same page.
328	Let me know what you think.
329	Yes, but we are consistenly being OOMC'd, so it's kind of an ongoing question.
329	Thanks,
330	I need some support on this: For the last two weeks, Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.
330	They have told us to run the plant, without question.
330	We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.
330	To a man, the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.
330	I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification) to Mark Patterson, starting weeks ago on this issue.
330	Yesterday, I caught Mark by phone at 5:30pm.
330	Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run, but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.
330	They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.
330	This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.
330	We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.
330	It costs us $26 to generate power.
330	Mark said " dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement."
330	Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity.
330	But what???
330	It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.
330	They want to penalize us if we dont run, and if we do , we will lose money.
330	We then file to get a break-even rebate.
330	They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.
330	I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.
330	I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.
330	I do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.
330	We will be more vocal in this meeting.
330	If no resolution is reached, I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions.
330	I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.
330	Thanks,
331	Thank you Bill!
332	David, I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation: Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.
332	This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
332	The OOMC, as I understand it, reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.
332	The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price, which currently is zero.
332	This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.
332	An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week, per Mark Patterson.
332	The second component of this option is OOME.
332	This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.
332	The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.
332	So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.
332	I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.
332	Here is the problem: the head of Ercot Market Operations, John Adams, interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.
332	When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC, they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
332	We explained to them, on numerous occasions, that we dont believe OOMC means run.
332	If they wanted us to run, then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.
332	I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run, yes or no.
332	When instructed to run by Ercot, we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.
332	I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep, Mark Patterson regarding this issue.
332	I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's intrepretation was correct.
332	For all of the times that we ran, at their request, we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc, rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).
332	For example, in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.
332	Mark also mentioned that when they said run, they expected us to sell to someone else, or just generate into the imbalance.
332	Mark told me "dont worry, you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."
332	Here is my view: OOMC does not mean run.
332	It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls, much like replacement, responsive reserve and non-spinning.
332	Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations, a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
332	If OOMC means to run, then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?
332	They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
332	OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.
332	This is basically the disagreement.
332	This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
332	Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a "breakeven."
332	Ridiculous.
332	I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment" on whether OOMC means to generate.
332	Mark Patterson now also has "no comment."
332	Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.
332	I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs. the imbalance price we will receive.
332	I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.
332	This has compelled Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need to have us online to control local congestion.
332	Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?
332	Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or , Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.
332	The latter is in effect.
332	Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment, unless we are already runnnig.
332	I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.
332	We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.
332	Once we have been OOMC'd, we will start to gen.
332	Once we reach full load, we will request an OOME.
332	If they dont comply, we will shut down the unit.
332	Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would request to be compensated in the form of an OOME."
332	The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.
332	Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?
332	Finally, I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.
332	It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.
332	Further, operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to OOME our plant."
332	Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?
332	If you agree with me, what is our next step?
332	I need to move aggressively on this issue.
332	Thanks,
333	This is a start.
333	I am having our Regulatory guy review our OOMC/OOME situation.
333	Thanks,
334	Please update your phone list with Frontera's new numbers.
334	They would prefer that we use the toll free number.
334	Thanks,
335	Please check out the following.
335	The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows: When we receive an OOMC, we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
335	If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME, then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.
335	We dont actually want to do this, as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.
335	We will discuss further in the meeting.
335	Thanks,
336	The latest from Frontera: They will not run unless we receive an OOME.
336	Call me if you need to, but call before 10pm.
337	Thanks for checking in with me.
337	I had a couple of questions: Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?
337	I currently do several things: I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.
337	I also manage the Ercot Asset book.
337	I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.
337	I am required to trade gas along with the power in order to properly hedge the plant.
337	I would be interested in continuing in this area.
337	Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.
337	I could send my resume, but if we dont have paralell needs, then I wont bother.
337	I have some other things that I am working on.
337	Thanks again for asking.
337	This company will be fine, but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.
337	When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.
337	However, although I am sure that Enron will bounce back, I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.
337	I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.
337	I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company, so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.
337	Anyway, thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.
338	Thanks
339	Sure, I am online everyday.
339	I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.
339	I start with hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9 is printed.
339	This is at my discretion.
339	You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and transact online.
339	You wont necessarily be trading with me, another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.
339	Let's trade it up!!!
340	A lot of shops are interested, mainly speculators.
340	I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.
340	Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure, locking in a fixed return.
340	How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc. No problem with EOL, as we are trading it up.
340	You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.
340	You will see Ercot S 8-22 and N 8-22.
340	You will need to add these and every other hour listed.
340	Thanks,
341	Frontera was asked to generate 135 mw's for this day.
341	They were generating but our meter read was showing zero.
341	Ercot was also showing zero.
341	Steve Olinde called and Frontera assured us that they were running.
341	We will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 1 - 7?
341	I am not sure when the meter came back, but it was ok when I came in this morning.
341	Thanks,
342	Mark Patterson, our Rep, called today to ask me if everything was resolved to my satisfaction.
342	I relayed that I did talk to John Adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.
342	This is great, however, Mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
342	He relayed that in the event of line meltdown, etc. we would be liable.
342	John Adams also said this last night.
342	We are officially on notice of pIn my opinion we need to: Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols, to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."
342	Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.
342	Thanks,
343	I kind of lost my temper a bit with Mark.
343	Probably wont sound good on tape, but I told him that a monkey-man wouldnt interpret the protocols that wIts the Dynegy thang talking.
344	We are long 50 mw's (ercot asset book) for the 2x16 .
344	This is scheduled into the North market.
345	We are long 50 mw's for 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.
345	The length is under the Ercot Asset book and the cost is $15.
345	I am concerned about Sunday morning, specifically, hours ending 7-11.
345	If you could sell this for a decent price, it would be a good thing.
345	The purchase is an interdesk deal, so it wont show in Enpower Scheduling.
345	Also, for hours ending 15-20 on Sunday we are long an additional 100 mw's at $16.31.
345	The purchase is under deal #873330 from City of Austin.
345	The temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on Sunday ahead of the cold front.
345	This is scheduled to the North Zone under Enpower 873332.
345	Either leave alone or sell under the Ercot Asset book.
345	For Monday, we are long 50 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal.
345	The length cannot be seen in Enpower scheduling.
345	This deal is under Ercot Asset and has been scheduled to load (north) under deal #873255.
345	Also, we have another 100 mw's from COA (see Enpower #873330) for he 15-20.
345	This is scheduled to north zone under enpower #873332.
345	Dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building Sunday evening.
345	The phones are to be inactivated here at 5:30 pm Sunday.
345	Thanks and lets trade it up!
346	Any luck on developing this tool?
346	Also, tell me the status of the Esca people.
346	The hourly trading system is not complete and I understand that they are leaving.
346	No documentation on how to use the system is available, as far as I can tell.
347	We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.
347	OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.
347	Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.
347	I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.
347	Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.
347	Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.
347	So, for the times that we were asked to run, Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.
347	How far can we go back in a dispute?
347	I thought we were somewhat limited.
348	It appears that Ercot is reversing their interpretation.
348	We still need to dispute/collect for OOMC payments and also file under OOME heat rate provisions for all of the times that we ran when we were under OOMC.
348	Does this make sense?
349	The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us by COA.
349	The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power.
349	COA wants us to "split the meter" at the plant, allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement.
349	Otherwise, they dont want to allow us intraday capability.
349	The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.
349	Their would be two gas contracts to consider, I suppose: Enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.
349	When do you want to talk?
350	So, it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for OOME?
350	I am of the opinion that for every time I was ordered to run under the OOMC, I should be paid the OOME calc.
350	Is this flawed logic?
350	What do you think.
351	We are short 50 mw's for offpeak tomorrow @ $13.
351	I would not expect to have to fill this, but if you do, buy in the South and schedule under Ercot Asset.
351	We originally purchased this power from El Paso.
351	Call me with questions.
352	Tuesday good.
352	I am at 680 , where the heck are you?
353	Please check for your new Trid for your turret.
353	Thanks,
354	thanks
355	The move has been very smooth
356	Gerald, I am talking with Gary Bryan.
356	You do need to be involved in this and I need your feedback.
356	Come by when you get a chance.
357	Kim, Has the Savings plan website changed?
357	I admit seeing a e-mail about the change of administrators, but I didnt realize the website would be incapacitated.
357	What's up?
358	We still need to provide detail on when errors/ problems actually occur.
358	I will work to get this to you by tomorrow.
358	Thanks,
359	thank you, you are one of my favorite hr reps
360	here is some more specific detail, as promised.
360	Thanks,
361	more detail
362	thanks alex!!
363	We have 25 mw's of length for the 8 hr offpeak block from thanksgiving through monday.
363	hours ending 23 & 24 have the most value.
363	This is your position, leave in North pool or sell as necessary.
364	Ben, Our Ercot lines arent working.
364	We are located at desks 678-680.
364	Also, could you please make the Ercot lines 1-4 appear on page 1 of all Ercot hourly traders phones?
364	You did this for us in the old building, but those changes didnt transfer.
364	The traders are: Joe Capasso Alex McElreath George Phillips Steve Olinde John Forney Thanks,
365	Mr Taylor, I have attached my resume, that explains what the heck I have been doing.
365	Let me know if anyone has interest in a profitable Woodlands boy.
365	Thanks!
366	There is length for the offpeak scheduled in the North and South.
366	LET IT RIDE, no adjustment is necessary.
366	Ercot Asset is long 50 mw from 12-23 in the North.
366	We will monitor and sell hourly, as needed.
366	Thanks,
367	I want to go to this!
368	Victor, Thanks for calling today.
368	Obviously this hasnt been the best day in my 8 year career with Enron!
368	I have attached my resume for your review.
368	I am interested in talking to you in more detail at your convenience.
368	Thanks again, cell phone 713-412-7529
369	For all that have missed the floor meeting, we have been downgraded to "junk" status, ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
369	A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.
369	Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.
369	If bankruptcy is filed, payroll should be covered.
369	Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.
369	There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.
369	Currently, we are not trading.
369	We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.
369	Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.
369	We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.
369	More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.
369	Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.
369	We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.
370	Shane, Thanks for your inquiry.
370	See the attachment and let me know if your company has questions.
371	Shane, Thanks for your inquiry.
371	If you have additional questions, please ask.
372	Kayla, LCRA exercised their option for tomorrow, 11/30.
372	See deal no.
372	882244.
372	I dont remember whether this gets trued up or not.
372	Im sure it does.
372	Call if you have questions.
373	Deb and I think of you guys from time to time.
373	I am looking for a new gig as well.
373	Enron Texas is having a great year again trading, but I am somehow out of work (out of credit, at least).
373	Stay in touch and good luck.

374	Director, Ercot Trading
375	Victor, We spoke a couple of days ago concerning employment opportunities at LCRA.
375	Do you have any questions about the resume that I sent?
375	I can supply additional info or answer questions, as necessary.
375	I was also wondering what specifically LCRA was looking for.
375	I have QSE experience and am familiar with Ercot billing.
375	Addtionally, I have some extremely capable co-workers that would be interested in talking with your firm.
375	Our Ercot team has been profitable and is extremely motivated.
375	Let me know if we have something in common.
375	Thanks, John Forney Director, Ercot Trading
376	Josh, Thanks for the inquiry.
376	I have attached my resume and if you could pass it on, I would appreciate it.
376	Thanks again and I'll be talking to you soon.
377	Julie, Please see my resume, as attached.
377	I would be able to meet Frank Busot and others this week or next, at their convenience.
377	Please note that I would prefer to travel out of Bush Intercontinental Airport, as it is very close to my home.
377	Thanks for your interest and let me know if I can provide more information to your company.
377	John Forney Director, Enron North America
378	I apologize for your situation, given the strong performance and effort that I have witnessed from you.
378	You are a true professional and I know that things will work out for the better.
378	I expect to know my own status later this week.
378	Here is my contact info: cell: 713-412-7529 home: 281-419-4388 Please see the attached resume and I look forward to speaking with you soon (even if it is over a beer).
379	What up badeer?
380	It doesnt take you long to respond to a slam.
380	of course, no details of our discussion were mentioned to badeer - i told bobby that you sounded like you came from a bar the last time i talked to you.
380	i am flying out of state for an interview on monday.
380	i expect to fly again later next week.
380	i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at Enron, but this proposition is less likely than my leaving.
380	the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers, in my opinion.
380	We will be dogged with credit issues and lawsuits for a long time.
380	what do you think?
381	Greetings: My name is John Forney and I am currently an employee of Enron North America.

381	I have been involved, primarily, in electricity and gas trading.
381	I also have gas purchase and natural gas pipeline experience.
381	I have a proven track record of success and look forward to new challenges.
381	I have attached my resume which details my experience and capabilities.

381	Thanks for your time, John Forney Director, Ercot Trading
382	We understood, at the time, that the test was going well.
382	This is Frontera's test to continue to bid in replacement and non-spin.
383	thank you
384	havent talked to you for awhile.
384	hope everything is going as well as can be..
384	i have a biz question: is the cash balance plan safe?
385	george, here is some info...
386	Frank, Thanks for meeting with me yesterday.
386	I am impressed with your operation and the people who will be building this from the ground up.
386	I'm sure we will be talking again soon.
386	I regret that I wasnt able to stay longer and possibly catch some specs.
386	Thanks again, John Forney
387	Allan, I havent heard anything from Anadarko, but I am talking to several other players.
387	There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.
387	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.
387	We still need to make time for that beer.
387	I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.
387	I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at Enron.
387	My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.
387	They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to Houston.
387	I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes, but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what Jim has to offer.
387	This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable.
387	If you could review and pass these on, I would really appreciate it: this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.
387	Just kidding Tell me what is happening with you.
387	( I still dont miss Koch, but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).
387	I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron.
387	I had been looking for him before the layoffs, but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc. Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.
387	We dont have to talk about work.....no, lets not talk about work!
387	Thanks,
388	Rob, attached are my friend's resumes.
388	i also added mine for your critique.
388	Let me know what you think.
388	I need to talk to you about negotiating a new deal; unfortunately it looks as if I may be leaving the state, either to Florida or back to Oregon.
388	The offers are starting to come in, but I dont want to leave anything on the table.
388	Need your advice, so let's have that beer!
389	Frank, I spoke with Victoria Bender and Julie Gildea yesterday.
389	Julie expects to send me some info today.
389	I will be out of the office after lunch today, so it would be best if she sends e-mail to my home address, My cell phone will also be on, the number is 713-412-7529.
389	Thanks,
390	Amy, do you have time to meet with me for 15 minutes?
390	thanks,
391	yep

392	this is my 13th anniversary with the wife.
392	i am going to humble for some dinner.
392	we are going to florida on wednesday and will return on sunday.
392	the company down there is flying us out to take a closer look at the area.
392	it looks as if i have sold the audi.
392	a guy put a deposit down on it today and i am supposed to meet him tomorrow.
392	lets golf soon.
393	Isac's last day was November 6th.
393	He took a job with Vitol, in the oil trading area.
393	I dont recall who his HR rep was.
393	Hope this helps,

15	Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product name: EPNG SoCal Ehr.
15	This product name should be used under the product type US Gas Phy.
15	The description should contain the same language as the EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted every time the word "Topock" appears.
15	We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
15	I left you a message to call me if you can today.
15	Thanks.
16	Looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current product and create a new one also
17	i am not in risk - can you get with anne bike and explain what you need her to do?
17	thanks.
18	we all have the same address but different work station locations - let me get them for you -- our street address is 1400 Smith here are the work locations: Tori EB3208C Randy EB3208D Patti EB3208E Kelli EB3235B Hope that helps.
19	Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).
19	My husband, Patrick( One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions.
19	We also use Chase Continental Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.
19	I have made Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.
19	This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.
19	I booked tickets for a vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on December 1.
19	Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due to complications with my pregnancy.
19	My doctor indicated to me that I may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.
19	I spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I book a ticket for me or my husband.
19	I understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend.
19	In my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications.
19	As you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child.
19	I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy.
19	I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.
19	He was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - I already told you NO!"
19	I had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping that I would be able to fly again by now.
19	For your information, your competitor was very helpful.
19	They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if I am still unable to use it.
19	That ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare.
19	Although I have always used Continental for my personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices.
19	If there is anything you can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.
20	Here is the information that you needed: My tickets were electronic and the confirmation number was NGP6MP.
20	Thank You.
21	hey renata.
21	how's everything going with you guys.
21	i know i never respond to any emails - i usually just get too busy.
21	sorry about that.
21	anyway, i wanted to catch up and to let you know that pat and i are going to be parents!
21	i still cant believe it.
21	i'm due in june.
21	anyway, we moved into a new house in katy, close to my parents.
21	(had to be prepared).
21	hope everything's going great with y'all.
21	give me an update!
21	take care.
22	hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe $145 - can you verify?
22	thanks.
22	also - can you tell me if i won anything for making the semi-finals?
23	october preliminary invoice:
24	I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather Evans that I was friends with for so long.
24	So, I am finally writing you an email.
24	I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori (Hatter).
24	I'd love to know what is going on in your life.
24	I was hoping you'd make it to the reunion last year.
24	Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me an email - let's catch up.
25	I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.
25	As for me, I got married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at UT.
25	We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.
25	Anyway, we'll be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.
25	I spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am doing something completely different that I absolutely love.
25	I work for Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.
25	I'm trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and challenging.
25	My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.
25	We bought a house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved into a new house that we built in Katy.
25	We wanted to be close to my parents and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live there.
25	Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.
25	Oh yeah - and my address is: I hope we can keep in touch.
25	I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.
25	Give me some more details in the next email!
25	Take Care and Happy Holidays!
25	Love, Tori
26	the current bid for jan-june for the west texas pool gas would be HSC-.06.
26	this bid should be right on the market according to what i have found.
26	please feel free to check around if you'd like, but i will need an answer today if you want be to start pulling gas on the 4th.
26	thanks.
27	Here you go!
27	Happy New Year!
28	the price on the deal was 10.30
29	Thanks for having the league.
29	I'd definitely do it again next year.
29	Here's
30	We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.
30	The location - PG&E Topock - has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change to the long description.
30	The line which reads - "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E, El Paso."
30	should be changed to "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E Topock" Please let me know when we can review the change, as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as possible.
30	Thanks.
31	thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco restricted product.
31	i am still getting complaints from people who should have access, but they are telling me that they do not.
31	thank you.
32	these charges are not valid - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a constrained point.
32	several people on the desk discussed this potential problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not intend on paying any penalty charges.
32	this deal was done on a gtc - spot contract, not on their firm agreement.
33	I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the item said that it would ship in 24 hours.
33	I chose regular shipping, which should mean that it should be on its way.
33	However, the order status still says that it hasn't shipped.
33	How can I find out what it causing the delay?
34	just got your email address from rachel.
34	congrats on your promotion.
34	i'm sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great deal.
34	my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.
34	i love it there - my parents live about 10 minutes away.
34	new news from me - i'm having a baby - due in june.
34	i can't even believe it myself.
34	the thought of me being a mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need to start growing up.
34	i'm really excited though.
34	rachel is coming to visit me in a couple of weeks.
34	you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo stuff?
34	you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.
34	it was the weirdest thing - heather evans.
34	i hadn't talked to her in about 10 years.
34	seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.
34	anyway, i'll let you go.
34	gotta get back to work.
34	looking forward to hearing back from ya.
35	just confirmed with mike - we are still good with that offer.
36	hey girl - you guys doing anything tonight?
37	thats awesome!
37	i'm so happy for him!
37	- what day is your actual birthday - i always forget the exact date.
38	hey brook - i was wondering if you sent that check - because if you did - i didnt get it- no big deal - just checking
39	we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december purchases from sg interests.
39	we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 12/21 on deal 528768.
39	however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.
39	the counterparty agrees with me and they will be reinvoicing us.
40	we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.
40	i wont mention it if you dont want me to.
40	anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked to you in a while.
40	as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc. by the way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!
40	i lost my waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though they all look huge.
40	anyway - talk to you soon
41	I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and not the printer.
41	My order number is 507208940.
41	Can you check on the status of the printer?
41	Thanks.
42	maybe - what do you think?
43	hey - just wanted to say happy birthday!
43	and, find out how you're doing - perfect i'm sure.
43	you would totally laugh if you saw me right now - i'm starting to look pretty darn preggo.
43	anyway - i may try to call you later today.
43	take care.
44	well - sounds like you had a great birthday!
44	whats your next stop?
44	still
45	that sounds awesome - dont catch any dangerous diseases.
45	do you know scott thompson at southern?
45	if you do, i heard he has connections in south africa.
45	i probably wont talk to you again before you leave so - have a great time.
45	i wanna hear all about it when you get back.
45	take care.
46	phillip is a buyer of calpine - CPN - you wanna check into that?
47	hey fletch - i was wondering if you had any access to bbq cookoff tickets for the enron tent this weekend.
47	i have a friend coming in from new york and he really wants to swing by there.
47	let me know.
47	thanks
48	Hey Sean!
48	I just thought about you yesterday because I remembered your birthday was coming up.
48	I have no idea if this is the correct email address for you, so I won't write too much.
48	Write back if you can - I have alot to tell you.
49	hey - just wanted to see hoe your trip went - i dont even know if you're back yet.
50	WOW!
50	Congratulations on your engagement.
50	I remember you talking about her at the reunion.
50	I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever a doubt.
50	Well, my news is also big.
50	I'm expecting a little girl on June 11th.
50	Talk about a life changing event.
50	Pat and I moved to Katy to live close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.
50	I really love it there.
50	It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March.
50	I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really well.
50	Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and catch up a little.
50	I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new email when you leave Seattle.
50	Until next time - take care and have fun planning the wedding!
51	Hi Amber.
51	I have misplaced my truequote ID and password and I would like to start looking at the system (finally).
51	Is there any way you could send me my info again?
51	Thanks, Tori.
52	Oh - i forgot to mention - John Perdew wants your body.
53	I'd like a swatch of Seaside Baby.
53	My mailing address is 4419 Stackstone Ln.
54	Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.
54	Anyway, I've been feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your life.
54	I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out in Katy.
54	I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.
54	We're expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.
54	Anyway, I'd love to see what's going on with you.
54	Write back if you can.
55	I'm so glad you wrote back.
55	Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?
55	I have been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by the house you grew up in. I thought about you every time I drove by, and I had to find you.
55	Congratulations on your marriage.
55	Where did y'all meet?
55	How's your family?
55	Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.
55	I can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years?
55	That makes me feel old!
55	I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought!
55	Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call first - my number is 281-578-9135.
55	P.S.
55	-- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?
55	She's still one of my closest friends and she says "HI."
56	i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.
56	it really hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.
56	i can't talk to you about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.
56	once again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you wanted.
56	but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.
56	i love you!
56	tori
57	I need to add some more people to our restricted list for our blanco product, but i need someone from eol to send me an update of the current list.
57	Can I get this today?
57	Thanks.
58	We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 1st.
58	The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.
58	The customer list, however, will be different than the blanco list.
58	We need to get on this right away.
58	Please let me know what I need to do.
59	The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.
59	The reason why we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso Merchant Energy from trading them.
59	The reason why we want to do this is that El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.
59	We feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing field level.
59	I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.
59	Again, the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on eol by 2/28 at the latest.
59	Thanks for your help.
60	Hey Sheri.
60	How's everything going?
60	Hope you had a good time on your Vegas trip.
60	I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.
60	I had a question for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.
60	I have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.
61	I'm glad everything worked out for you.
61	Hope you have a great time!
62	i show -.05 in my notes as well as on the paper ticket
63	Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.
63	Can we make these changes as soon as possible?
63	I would like to be able to tell the new counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!
63	Thanks!
64	I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this is just the beginning of that!
64	Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume.
64	He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off myself.
64	Thanks again.
65	Thanks for your help!
66	due on june 11th!
66	3.5 more months
67	Jennifer Lamprecht Susan Hadix Pam Macaul Dana Richardson Terra Henderson Cathy Morse Diane Hoyuela Kristin Wilson Jennifer Taylor Donna Hatter - my mom Dorothy Glasscock - my grandmother
68	I have a friend who is possibly interested in the trading positions that we have open, but I wanted to find out exactly what types of trading positions they are.
68	CAn you give me some more details?
68	thanks.
69	hey jack -- sorry i missed your call the other night -- i've either been out or exhausted every night.
69	this whole pregnancy thing is really tiring.
69	anyway, i just wanted to get back to you - i'll try to call soon -- didnt want you to think i was ignoring you.
70	here's the right email address.
70	talk to you soon.
71	i got ahold of them and they are going to stop by the house tomorrow and look at everything and give us an estimate
72	you should see me try to play golf right now - it is downright comical.
73	nasdaq is scary!
73	you think we could lose another 30% of what we have in there??
73	should we just leave it in for the long term and wear all the pain now?
74	i will be attending
75	hey girl -- havent talked to you in a while.
75	just wanted to catch up and see whats new.
76	here are the two new index descriptions that we need: Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating conditions. The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
76	We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational constraints.
76	I think this is close enough to the original language that it should not be a problem.
76	Thanks for your help.
77	Here is the resume we talked about:
78	hey heath -- sorry it took so long to get back to you -- we plan on at least going to dinner -- dont know how long we'll stay out after that -- i'll do my best.
78	See you there.
79	hey sheri -- i forgot my logon and password for dynegy direct -- we havent looked at it in so long but now we want to again.
80	hey kristi -- the bunko is going to be on april 9th at my house.
80	hope to see you there.
81	please add Astra Power LLC to the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products.
81	thank you.
82	without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would be risk analysis or scheduling probably.
82	i'm not sure how much you make but i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.
82	you can send me your resume though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can.
83	so sorry to hear about your loss.
83	our thoughts will be with you.
84	ext 3-3275
85	1.
85	yes 2.
85	no 3.
85	no let me know if you need anything else
86	scott and i talked and we cannot say definitively that triad called us first every single day -- there may have been some days when we called them.
86	we can call you if you need further explanation.
87	This is just to remind everyone that bunko is at my house on Monday April 9th.
87	Please let me know as soon as you can if you are not going to be able to make it.
87	Thanks and I look forward to seeing all of you there.
88	hey beverly -- do you have phone numbers for any of the people that werent there last time??
89	hey there!
89	hope everything is going great with you.
89	things are still going pretty smoothly with me - thank goodness.
89	my actual due date is 6/11 so i only have about 2 months left.
89	i'm starting to realize why people are always miserable in the last couple of months.
89	anyway - my address is 4419 Stackstone Ln.
89	Katy, TX 77450.
89	Talk to you soon.
90	what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the drinks.
90	i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we will need at least one extra person.
90	it looks like everyone that was there last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that still leaves us short.
90	i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too much.
90	the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can possibly be.
90	kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming.
90	we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all the kids.
91	you are so sweet to think of me.
91	i dont know why you would ever be in houston, but if you are, we definitely need to get together.
91	talk to you soon.
92	i never heard back on this request -- was it done??
93	Hello - I was the one who asked about your high chair covers at Fuzzy's pizza the other night.
93	I was wondering if i could get more information on patterns and cost.
93	Thank you.
94	i will be here all this week and really any time after about 10 am is fine to stop by
95	hey - thats funny about john - he definitely remembers him - i'll call pat and let him know - we are coming on saturday - i just havent had a chance to call you guys back -- looking forward to it -- i probably need the directions again though
96	not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it.
96	we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.
96	we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple.
97	hope everyone is okay with this -- i talked to the people that were here and we all agreed.
98	hey dan - it's tori from the good ole west gas desk.
98	i was talking to the klapper the other day and he said that i might be able to forward my hubby's resume to you to see if you knew of any good fits for his experience in your arena.
98	his background is in ecommerce account management/development and other IT consulting and auditing.
98	i'm gonna go ahead and attach his resume.
98	please let me know if you think there's anything here for him - i would greatly appreciate the help.
98	thanks, tori
99	thanks
100	can you just let me know one way or the other if his background would be compatible with anything that might come up?
100	thanks.
101	hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need to make blanco a restricted product.
101	can we go ahead and change these ep blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted products?
101	let me know...
102	i need to send jennifer a shower invitation and i have your address but i lost the zip code - duh.
102	can you forward me your zip code??
103	Hi.
103	I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the new day care center.
103	I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether or not we have been accepted.
103	I know the center doesn't open until September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line something up if I do not get in. Also , do you know an exact date for the scheduled opening?
103	Thanks for your help.
104	damn - we eat really early here - they bring lunch at 11 oclock if you can believe it.
104	maybe i will come meet you anyway and not eat - it's dead here today.
104	when and where were you planning on going??
105	wow - thats awesome - have a great time -- bring pictures to the baby shower -- you should be getting an invitation soon -- i think my friend jennifer is sending them out early next week.
105	i cant believe i only have 7 weeks left!
106	the trader over there is JB Smith.
106	if you would like - you can send me a copy of the invoice, and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached - and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the issure to be resolved.
107	lets start on the 30th -- monday -- that way we can start it for may 1st trades.
108	We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.
108	I will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.
108	I will probably have to go get the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my share of the bill.
108	( Thats what happened last time) Thanks.
109	hey there.
109	just wanted to see how the bike ride went.
109	also wanted to let you know that pat got a job.
109	thank goodness.
109	anyway, write back or call when you get a chance.
110	we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.
110	Tori, Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.
110	Their address is now correct.
110	As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades detailed below.
110	Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.
110	Trades to Cancel: Confirm Date Agent Buyer Agent Seller Therms To confirm that you agree to cancel, then please forward this to him at gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree.
110	(You can also hit "REPLY ALL" since I cc'd on this email).
110	I will call you and let you know what the new downstream contract will be.
110	Thanks Parks Wesson Astra Power, LLC
111	looks good
112	just seeing if you were back from your trip.
112	maybe we can go for lunch sometime this week.
112	let me know when you're free.
113	thursday sounds great -- and around 1130 would be good if you can make it -- we can go to bourays, ny pizzeria, allen center -- whatever you want.
114	for deal 694859 -- it should be 4.48 for deal 697646 -- for the 30-31 it should be 4.50
115	hey there - i was just talking about you with my mom - she said she talked to you again today and i was laughing that she's talked to you alot more than i have lately!
115	dinner friday sounds great.
115	what else have you been up to??
115	did you already have the river trip??
115	we havent been out at all -- just too tiring for me to do anything but dinner right now.
115	we're just trying to get everything ready -- it's pretty exhausting.
115	well - i better get back to work -- talk to you soon and see you friday!
116	river trip sounded like a blast!
116	the pool is going well - next step is the deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 weeks.
116	pat got a job - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be working downtown at waste management.
116	it was a pretty good offer -- good benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he had at bank united.
116	we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care center -- that was a big relief.
116	so -- things continue to fall into place -- we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues...
117	do you not have instant messenger at work anymore??
118	test
119	hey there.
119	i was wondering if you have nicole's address.
119	i wanted to get terra to send her a baby shower invitation just in case she might be coming into town, or at least it will serve as an announcement anyway.
119	thanks.
120	thanks so much - i am going to write her in addition to sending the invitation since it looks like she wont be in town anyway.
121	i talked to steve and he liked you alot -- who else did you talk to??
122	oh - ok -- she hasnt said anything but that doesnt surprise me -- she is actually the manager of the group and she usually doesnt talk much about her interviews -- i'll see what i can find out.
123	still on for lunch today??
124	i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan before we actually lock this thing up.
124	we are still going to do it, but we both feel better about having both names on the documents.
124	can you tell me exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working?
125	i should be there - barring any unexpected events of course...
126	i sure will - i think that would be a better fit for you anyway -- if i hear anything - i'll let ya know
127	sure

129	hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.
129	i was at dinner the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop you a note.
129	where are you these days??
129	things are pretty much the same around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born -- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.
129	wasnt sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or anything.
129	overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a good thing.
129	keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so "hi".
129	thats all from h-town for now.
129	hope you're doing well.
130	I need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol.
130	Thanks.
131	i guess i need access to view the site with the p/l, that is, if i am supposed to have it.
132	i did that the first time -- it takes me to a page that says i do not have permission to view that sight -- and it directs me to send you an email
133	i cant remember who you forwarded this request to -- she said it was done but i still cannot see the products.
133	my eol id is ADM53618 -- maybe it was updated on the wrong one.
134	let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is -- it may be closer to ngpl perm -- i have no idea until i see the physical location
135	should we be invested in oil producers instead of enron and calpine???????????????????
136	thought you might like to see a pic of the little one.
137	i heard this yesterday!
137	perfect example of the state of our economy!
138	i'm at a loss on calpine also -- seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building -- seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line -- i dont know - just a thought -- the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me.
139	can you give me the address for the kids center so i can complete the nomination form -- also do we put knowledge beginnings or lorraine as the center director?
140	Hi Lorraine.
140	I was trying to complete the form to nominate the Kid's Center for this award and I need the phone number and fax number there.
140	I'm not sure why I don't have them, but I don't.
140	Thanks for your help.
141	Hey Fritz.
141	I am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings.
141	In addition, I will also personally tell the hiring manager that I have done this and I can also give him an extra copy of youe resume.
141	Hopefully we can get something going here....
142	I would like to bid 20 points on Chris Weinke and if I dont get him - i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler
143	This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.
143	It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.
143	Let me know.
143	Thanks.
144	I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.
144	I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.
144	I also just realized that I forgot to include the attachment on the original message - oops.
144	Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?
144	I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab.
144	Thanks.
145	I also talked to the manager of the East region scheduling group and he said he would have HR call you for a screening interview, so be ready.
145	Call me anytime after about 11.
146	lots of good news out about duke energy -- low p/e -- take a look
147	Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.
147	It was good to see y'all again, but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.
147	I wanted to see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's all.
147	Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?
147	I'd love to get in touch with both of them.
148	Hey Tom and Nicole -- I wanted to get in touch with both of you -- I FINALLY got your email addresses.
148	My little girl - Erin - is almost 4 months old now - and is and absolute joy.
148	She's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on.
148	I wish you guys could see her.
148	I'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old.
148	After you see this - I won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy.
148	Life has definitely changed, but for the better.
148	Believe it or not, I haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so - HA!!
148	I'm still working at Enron, trading away -- it's still been the best move I ever made.
148	Pat is now at Waste Management after getting laid off from the little .com company.
148	Again, a very good turn of events.
148	We are loving Katy, especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors.
148	Enough about me -- please write back with updates - I feel like I've totally lost touch and I don't want to keep it that way.
148	Take Care and talk to you soon, Tori
149	Hi Steve -- I just wanted to let you know to change your distribution list for this email -- you can take me and Jan off and add Patti Sullivan -- patti.sullivan@enron.com and Ted Evans -- ted.evans@enron.com.
149	Thanks.
150	that date works for me as of now -- and i do have a few things
151	Have fun in Port A -- i'll tentatively pencil in the 28th - let me know if something comes up and i will do the same
152	the seats are in the lowest section - within one of the baselines -i cant really remember what row - they are pretty good though
153	sounds like a good plan -- i guess the best thing to do is follow advice of the experts -- hopefully we will win in the long run
154	ok - great - sounds good - let me know if you need any more information
155	hello - i left you a message on your cell phone a month ago - I thought you decided that you didnt want to talk to me or something.
155	CALL ME -- 713-853-3275.
156	Hey there.
156	All is well with Erin and with me.
156	Although I can tell you that I definitely have not had time to pick up a book lately.
156	Our day consists of -- wake up at 5, feed Erin, get ready, drive to work, work, drive home, feed the baby, eat dinner, play with the baby, bathe the baby, go to sleep -- and I'm really lucky if I'm not awakened at 2 or 3 am.
156	But, it's ALL worth it.
156	I would be glad to give you a recommendation -- any idea where you want to be?
156	There are a few people hiring right now for sure.
157	hey- got your voicemail - i'll definitely try to meet up with you when you are in town.
157	i already have a ton of plans in the next couple of weeks so i'm not sure how many more nights i can stay here late.
157	what time are you leaving on the 17th?
158	well - the problem is that I have 2 dinners next week and one om the 17th - it's tough to leave pat at home with the baby that many nights -- but we'll see
159	Mike - I need to go to the doctor tomorrow - the only appt I could get was 12 noon and it's in Katy, but I will get back as soon as I can.
159	I have been having some issues over the past week or so and I really need to get it checked out.
160	I would like to bid 10 points for wade richey in this weeks free agency draft
161	well - the gentleman's package seems a little excessive since it has a manicure and a haircut thrown in. It looks like if we do the massage and facial only - it would be about $150 total.
161	The phone number is 713-685-6718.
162	i dont know him but he's legit - just looked him up.
162	what job are they calling about?
163	i hope not - but you never know with those HR guys.
163	anyway -- if you get some more details -- i'll fill you in on any info i have
164	the plan sounds good to me - i think signs are usually enough -- just put a few out at all the possible routes
165	works here
166	that works for me
167	i guess we know why it tanked now -- i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - i would believe anything - this sucks -- we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say
168	I don't think you would really want to be here right now anyway.
168	Not the best environment - besides - you hate Houston, right?
168	Have you gotten any other leads?
169	sounds like you have some good prospects - if you can land something decent in this economy then i think you're doin okay.
169	good luck - keep me updated.
170	okay - so here's the deal - ugh - i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again.
170	pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick, so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead.
170	they usually leave pretty early on sunday, but with your time constraints with the foleys thing - i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle.
170	i'll let you know if anything changes - if not, it may be back to the drawing board.
170	i saw terra, di ,and nicole this weekend in austin - it was great to hang out with nicole if only for a little bit.
170	how's john's job search going?
170	it's pretty rough out there - i've been thinking about you guys alot, hoping he can get something soon.
170	anyway - i'll let you go -- take care.
171	i think it's going to be virtually impossible for me to skip out early on afternoon meetings for a while.
171	So, i may end up having to be here til 5 on days that we have the bigger ones.
171	this sucks but i think i just have to out up with it for a while.
171	you okay with this?
172	insiders starting to buy here
173	ok - so it looks like pats mom has to work on sunday so i guess it's back on - we should be able to get there at about 12:30.
173	what do you want me to bring?
174	i met with chris today and i think we are going to try something else before we go forward with these - you can get with him for the details - thanks
175	ok - my opinion - i think signs are enough but am not opposed to pitching in for an ad, i will try my best to come over friday night but if i cant - what time will you be up on saturday?
176	i have a table and chairs, coffee table, vacuum cleaner, pictures, dishes, thats about it i think
177	yeah - last week was just a case of bad timing - come back soon!
178	Great Pictures!
178	Too bad you have to go back to real life.
178	Anything new on the job search?
179	i probably cant find a baby sitter that late on a thursday
180	we have a meeting at 3 today -- cnbc is doing a report at 3:50 -- i will let you know
181	so - here's the synopsis - everything is business as usual - we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100% - we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours - it's going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company.
182	ok - let me know when you guys can try to come up with a solution.
182	also, mike would like to know if eol can work on a new functionality that would allow a trader to create a fixed price physical product that could link to price, basis, and index in order to prevent arb opportunities from the market.
182	any ideas on that?
183	david - where are we on this?
183	is there any hope of getting this done?
184	why dont i try kim or marta first?
185	i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler
186	i also would bid 5 points for charlie batch if i dont get fiedler -- i also want to bid 25 points for jason brookins
187	hey there -- we are doing really well - i cannot believe that she's almost 5 months old.
187	anything new with you guys?
187	hope all is well.
187	pat's email is pkuykendall@wm.com and his phone number is 713-265-1216.
187	maybe you guys can come out and visit sometime soon.
188	hey - seems like we arent the only ones that think kyle is an arrogant asshole anymore - susan told me that on saturday night she had it out with him and doesnt want him around -- also, apparently he's been treating dana like shit and it's starting to get noticed by other people -- just thought this was an interesting development.
189	i talked to chris a little bit and he is going to call back tonight at 6 at home.
190	how's this for the daily update: "Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued. Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering. The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation. However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company. I will keep you updated on developments as they occur"
191	wow - i wonder....
192	tell me what you think - or any ideas to add - the changes were done by pat - i havent read it yet as it would be odd to pull it up here so i dont know if i agree with them or not
193	i am hearing from the youngsters that bullets are the way to go -- also, i'm out of ene in the schwab - oh well - another $300 down the drain - my fault this time
194	Hi Chris -- wanted to make a couple more changes on the resume after having someone review it -- will forward this evening.
194	Thanks again.
195	just saw on cnbc -- enron talking deal with dynegy
196	this is so ironic
197	they halted trading on the stock - we are restating all financial statement since 1997 - i couldnt sell in time - i hope you talked to rick - i couldnt get ahold of you -- this sucks really bad
198	agreed
199	i can't go on wednesday -- i have a dinner interview -- it was the only time the guy could do it.
199	sorry.
200	thank my buddy rachel for all these things....
201	ok - so we all owe $45 -- somebody can just give me $20 and then everyone else can pay dana.
201	I'm not in a hurry so no biggie.
202	I'm jealous - i can't go wednesday!
202	have an interview and that was the only time they could do it.
203	well - it's okay -- alot of people here are really confident about going head to head with dynegy traders and kicking their asses -- and i've had a pretty good year so i'm not that worried -- but - that said -- i do have a couple things lined up just to see if there's something better -- what about you?
203	did you get your interview at pan can yet??
204	i'm doing great -- the baby is so much fun but alot of work -- i feel tired 90% of the time -- enron is actually okay -- i feel good about my chances to stay on with the "new empire" -- but, i'm still taking this as an opportunity to explore some other options to see if there may be something incredible out there that i am missing out on.
204	what's new with you??
205	advice -- any trips you want to take - do it now - start saving a bunch of money - and just remember -- when you start trying - it could happen on the first try!!!
206	hey ken -- looking forward to meeting with randy tonight (he probably told you already) -- i know he's talked to some other people that he hasn't been too impressed with -- do you know if there is anything special that he's looking for -- or i should say -- anything that specifically rubs him the wrong way -- my only bonding experience with him has been making fun of janie at parties!!
207	I'M IN -- assuming we leave at 3 which i think is the case
208	hey - thanks for getting back anyway -- i thought it went pretty well - he said -- let's keep talking -- kevin masek was there too - i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well.
208	i had a good time -- seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though.
208	i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far.
208	and, i think i can bring alot to the table for him.
208	we'll see what happens.
208	i know he'll tell you everything :).
209	any new progress on this??
210	can i write you a check for this?
210	and, by the way, have people been paying you, because alot of people dont read their email
211	this is the rebuild of all the gas daily and index spreads including the addition of aeco spreads along with a few others
212	I just wanted to send a follow-up thank you for dinner the other night.
212	It was nice to see you again and to hear about the exciting prospects you have at RWE.
212	I know I would enjoy being a part of your trading team, and I truly believe that I can provide you with a good base a knowledge and a strong desire to continue to grow as a trader within your organization.
213	I heard a rumor that you guys may be hiring -- is this true, and, if so -- for what?
214	i have dinner at my parents' tonight -- meeting my brother's girlfriend!!
214	have fun though.
215	susan was already paying me -- i think there may be some confusion - i'll let you guys work it out -- thanks!
216	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
216	I'm all teary eyed!
216	I knew you picked a good one!!
217	sounds great - we will definitely try to see you that weekend -- cinco ranch is actually public so that shouldnt be a problem -- willow fork is private but i think you can rent it and just pay more -- i went to a reception at the equestrian center once and that was really nice -- i know whatever you choose will be beautiful -- take care -- see you soon.
218	glad you made it safely!
218	enjoy the snow!
218	my home email is patrick_kuykendall@hotmail.com.
218	talk to you soon -- take care
219	phone number - 713-937-4575
220	i will be attending the party
221	celestine -- i have not been a member now for over a year -- can you take me off your mailing list?
221	thanks.
222	the 14th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 7th
223	sounds great
224	Hey Keith.
224	It was great catching up last night.
224	In response to our conversation, although I have already sent me resume there through a head hunter, I thought I would also forward it to you directly.
224	I'd love to have lunch with you in the near future to talk about the prospects.

0	Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.
0	I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx.
0	100 to 200 m2.
0	If my thinking is wrong please let me know.
0	DS
1	Projected flows DS
2	You are correct looking at the models Ken Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225 this will allow the pig to move approx.
2	between 5 to 6 miles an hour.
2	DS
3	Projected flows for Griffith.
4	Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.
4	We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.
4	This will allow us to set our HP accordingly.
4	Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.
4	However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes.
4	DS
5	Please see the attached

10	FYI We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.
10	DS
11	Lindy, You are correct they are physical plant receipt points.
11	The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.
11	Thanks DS
12	Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls.
12	DS
13	i will be there
14	What is the time frame these units need to be down.
14	There are no postings for volume deductions.
14	Please someone give me some ideas.
14	Thanks Ds
15	Ken, We currently have a unit down at Station 4.
15	If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.
15	DS
16	I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.
16	Dave can you do this for us.
16	This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.
16	DS
17	I will be on vacation.
17	DS
18	We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.
18	Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.

19	DS
20	Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral.
20	We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances.
20	Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.
20	If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.
20	Example: Non-Grid-- San Juan Scheduled 870,000 (we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.)
21	I'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me.
21	I have a ortho.
21	appt.
21	and I get my braces off.
21	On Thursday afternoon I have to back for my retainers.
21	Can we meet sometime in the morning.
21	DS
22	This is a new interconnect into the suction side of WT-1.
22	I think the capacity is going to be approximately 50,000 mmbtu.
22	This may be able to flow sometime this or next.
22	DS
23	I would like to attend.

26	These are pictures of the underground tunnel system.
27	Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map.
27	Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points.
27	Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added into the totals of the Central Area.
27	If they are in the total please exclude them.
27	Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.
27	Rio Puerco should still be added into the total Transport Receipt and Delivery.
27	If you have questions please call.
27	Thanks Ds
28	I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs.
28	It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.
28	I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's #7 of water.
28	They said it was more like drip.
28	This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.
28	I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
28	We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
28	If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.
28	Please let me know.
28	Thanks DS
29	Gary Gary Spaggins and I have a presentation that we have to give to Stan.
29	We cannot attend, Steve January is on vac.
29	There is no one else from our group.
30	Beginning today June 14, 2001 We need to operate the Interconnect points between Transwestern and Northern just like we do all others.
30	We have orders everyday and we need to balance unless both pipes have agreed to work on the imbalances.
30	When Transwestern or Northern get into operational constraints we need to work with all the Interconnect customers.
30	If customers are not in the position to help and we have to go out of balance on Transwestern or Northern for operational constraints, please leave myself, Gary or Steve and E:mail or telephone message of all volumes, and why's.
30	We will need to be able to address them in the morning meeting.
30	If you have any questions please feel free to ask.
30	DS
31	Right now I can plan on being there.
32	We need to be able to monitor everything there is to see just as we would monitor a TW on NNG interconnect.
32	Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need All Accums, (previous and current mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf.
32	on all runs, 2" rotary, 4" turbine meter, 10" ultra-sonic. All available History info.. This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site. Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up. We need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control. From what TW is hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week. Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to. I will be glad to help. DS
33	Thanks DS

49	Seems like gas control doesn't know anything about it.
49	Thanks ds
50	I plan on being in both days let me know what works best for you.
50	DS
51	When PG&E does a re-alignment on the weekend, please contact the TW logistics person and let them know so it can get scheduled.
51	On a second note: When PG&E requests to swap volumes to Socal the actual flow has to take place at the Topock points only.
51	They cannot take it to Needles.
51	If you have any questions please call.
51	DS
52	Thanks for the info.
52	DS
53	This is the error I got when trying to update capacity.

66	Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.
66	TW will be taking over the operations and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.
66	We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.
66	We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.
66	Currently in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.
66	Please get familiar with the points and how set points will need to be sent.
66	To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.
66	TW will be at 2.
66	When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.
66	Set points less than 140,000 will stay on flow control.
66	We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and El Paso.
66	Currently we have orders just off of TW.
66	1.
66	Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
66	this is on flow control.
66	2.
66	When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.
66	We will just have to experiment with the best operation.
66	3.
66	Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.
66	We are working with Citizens to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.) I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.
66	If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.
66	Last conversation with him was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.
66	In other words they really don't know which is the best way to operate.
66	Thanks DS
67	This is the E:mail we received about the Ivanhoe dehy maintenance.
67	Will you please respond.

73	Thanks DS
74	When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid.
74	We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.
74	When allocating points or groups that have not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
74	Example : Allocations are as follows The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue Timely: M/L Thoreau West System 1093.000 (capacity) I/B Link 700.000 (capacity) Socal Needles 775.000 (Window) Evening: Same sequence Non-Grid: Same sequence ID-1or ID-2: Same sequence shows up to be allocated.
74	Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.
74	The only time we should have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously allocated.
74	The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
74	lets try this for a while and see how it is working.
75	I will be here Tuesday only this week.
75	Tuesday works for me.
76	We will need to start operating the Griffith plant TW and El Paso points.
76	Refer to the previous memo that was sent suggesting the operations.
76	DS
77	When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point or group comment section in CAS.
77	2.
77	Low line pack inventory 3.
77	I/C or plant non performance 4.
77	High line pack inventory 5.
77	Compression status 6.
77	Other *During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments.
77	*Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS.
77	*When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.
77	We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update or allocate.
77	If you have any questions please call me or page.

93	The below attached has been reposted to the TW Web Site.
94	We need to make sure that when we have any issues concerning the Griffith plant we put something on the log.
94	It has been brought to our attention that we had a problem on Aug. 6th and Aug. 14th and there is nothing in the logs about anything.
94	I was here on the 6th and know they almost ran themselves out of gas because they started pulling more than our setpoint and did not call to let us know.
94	If anyone can recall what took place on the 14th please drop me and e:mail.
94	Citizens is trying to gather information on these days based on complaints from Griffith plant.

113	DS
114	TEST
115	After talking with Ken and our Gas Control it appears we had and operater error, a setpoint was put in at the TW mainline.
115	The problem was corrected and the plant pressure came back.
115	We think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control we hope to minimize the mistakes.
115	If any other concerns please call.
115	Thanks DS 713-853-4299
116	We need to keep our communications open to the plant.
116	I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
116	Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.
116	Ken, Sorry about yesterday.
116	Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant went down.
116	If you have any more questions please call.
116	Thanks DS 713-853-4299
117	They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.
117	They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and he didn't look at it.
117	I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes for a 24 hr period.
117	Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.
117	I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.
117	DS
118	I don't know that for a fact.
118	I assumed since they do the same thing for the lamar power plant they should know to do the same for Griffith and Calpine, that is why we send those daily schedules.
118	DS
119	This is fyi.
119	We need to be more careful on this point and refer to the schedule they send us.
119	Please if you have any questions call.
119	DS
120	FYI
121	Mike can you and Danny get with either Gary or myself to get access to change capacities for the MOPS system in NNG Contract Management System.
121	(CAS) We will show you where and how to do that.
121	You will also need to post outages to the NNG Web Site.
121	Thanks DS
122	This is what Ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss.
123	This is the schedule that was sent to gas control.
124	Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.
124	It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.
124	The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.
124	They had intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.
124	Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure the hourly take for the 24 hrs.
124	He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.
124	The Griffith plant has been on line since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers.
124	Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send any revisions.
124	Thanks DS
125	Ken this was forwarded to Gas Control.
125	Please add Gas Control to your E:mail distribution list.
125	DS
126	Please send a test page to the Gas Control address as I am on it.
126	Thanks DS
127	It's the same as the name, but with no spaces.
127	Please send us a test case.

134	Citizens Griffith Az.
134	I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF) The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline has been reset at 800#.
134	The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#.
134	Reason: This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.
134	This is for our protection.
134	You may need to raise the setpoint.
134	For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible.
134	If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.
134	Griffith Power Plt.
134	El Paso and TW (CITZ) We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.
134	Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer to the call out list for Citizens.
134	If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me.
134	The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11.
134	There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.
134	Let me know what you think of setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control.
134	Reason: TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith has orders from both pipelines.
134	Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up some guidelines for us to follow.
134	Thanks DS
135	Check with the plant.
136	We need to watch this real close.
136	We are scheduled for a conference call with Griffith and Citizens and El Paso.
136	They want to discuss operational scenarios.
136	Jesse I will let you know when and where so you can listen and add your view points from a gas control perspective.
136	Thanks DS
137	The gas temp that gas control see's leaving Roswell (station 9) is running between 85 to 95 degrees.
137	Please if I'm looking at this wrong please correct me.
137	Thanks DS
138	next week will be fine.
138	Let me know.
138	DS
139	What seems to be the problem with start up.
139	When you do will you be in more test phases or commercial.
139	DS
140	Sounds like to me they will still be swinging and still in the test mode.
140	TW will work with Griffith as we can.
140	DS
141	Sounds like you will still be in your test mode and need to swing.
141	TW will work with you as well as our system will allow.

154	Just in case you receive a call from either JB or David.
154	They were called yesterday and I spoke with Neal and let them know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and Monday.
154	They were short for Wednesday's gas day.
154	My conversation was with Neal that they make adjustments to their nominated volumes or turn on more gas.
154	It does not appear they did either one.
154	I will call them this morning and let them know that they have until ID-1 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or TW will be cutting their market for ID-1.
154	Maybe this is a good opportunity to discuss park and ride again.
154	TW covered 7,000 mmbtu/d of Markets according to the scada numbers that we see.
154	Let me know if you agree.
154	Thanks Ds
155	This will be for approximately 8 hrs.
156	Jeff will be calling you before they do anything.
157	FYI
158	Right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be.
158	If we don't have the volumes we can't do it.
158	The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal.
158	border.
158	We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to run the pigs.
158	Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should have taken advantage of this.
158	Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.
158	Thanks DS

187	It looks like we are over delivering 2000 to 3000 mmbtu/d at PG&E Topock everyday.
187	I will have the Field go out and take a look at the measurement.
187	We need to set the point approximately 5000 short every day until further notice.
187	I will visit with PG&E and let them know what we are doing.
187	DS
188	Talked with PG&E today and they would like to flow rate today and we can talk to them each day.
188	Our imbalance is 85,000 mmbtu they owe TW.
188	I will visit with Mike O'Donnell about our imbalance.
188	For now use the scada point for daily flow rates and not the spread sheet.
188	DS
189	It really doesn't matter if we have sold firm or not March is still available for maintenance, as we would do it through april, may or june.

190	Can you explain why we over delivered to NNG on total order.
190	Order: Flow: Please let us know.
190	Thanks DS
191	Disregard the below message.
191	Sorry about that.
191	I've got egg on my face.
191	TW did not over deliver to NNG.
191	The previous day accums for Estes did not role in scada until a little after 10:00 am.
191	I did call Dale to ask if that should take that long to role over.
191	We are just trying to keep a close eye on imbalances.
191	DS
192	This will have to wait until March timeframe.
192	They need to do better planning.
192	DS
193	Thanks DS
194	This is special from Christine .
195	Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation.
195	Please note Rob's message.
195	Gary will you and Tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the Citizens site.
195	The call will include all the above personnel.
195	After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything TW can or is willing to do, or is it a Citizens design problem.
195	I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday.
195	I will be on vacation tomorrow.
195	Thanks DS
196	This is an email sent to me after my conversation with Rob last week.
196	I don't know where he is leading with this.
196	However will every one please read the below and Jerry in my absense please work with everyone to try and come up with a solution that TW is willing to live with as we go forward as TW and EMAR (operators for Citizens).
196	Sorry I won't be able to any help this week as I will be traveling to New Mexico for my Mom's funeral.
196	I will try and stay in the loop as best I can.
196	Thanks for everyone's help in resolving this issue.

199	It worked.
199	Thanks ds
200	This is the outage for redrock tie-ins and volumes.
201	As of the 6th TW and NNG are balanced, I agree with Gary we need to stay balanced.
202	This is the most current.
203	Would this be something we would consider or do we need to suggest TW host in Houston.
204	you are correct however there are no nominations.
205	Yes I can.
205	Let me know when this is finalized.
206	looks good to me.
206	My portion.
207	We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.
207	We do not need to let this keep growing.
207	Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.
207	We need to keep the total order in balance.
207	We will work on this next week.
207	Thanks Ds
208	I don't think that decision has been made.
208	I think we should be allocating.
208	This should be discussed today at the TW afternoon marketing meeting.
209	As of the Jan. 11 Amy got them to take their schedule down from .444 to .088 and TW is now receiving make up.
209	We will continue to watch this point.
210	I called Steve Richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use.
210	I told him to get started.
210	This is for unit 602 down from 1/16 to 5/31.
210	We will still have two units available.
211	Per Robert Baker: The TW Valero Pecos I/C unavailable until further notice.
211	Will keep you updated.
211	Thanks DS
212	Yes we do and I will make copies.
213	Works for me.
214	I would like to know where and how this is going to affect us and all the parameters.

217	Melissa left a message that the volumes should start flowing to make the imbalance for the month.
217	They cannot split stream flows.
218	As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.
218	Gas Control Issues: Nominations: Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements between Duke and PPL.
218	You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics Team.
218	Flows: We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.
218	We will watch the noms this week to get a feel of where and how much they may vary.
218	As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.) Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary) When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed and switch back to 1 (TW primary).
218	If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.
218	Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the Site from Gas Control.
218	The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure problems.
218	Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.
218	Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.
218	Thanks DS
219	I will be out Thursday afternoon.
219	How about Friday sometime.
220	I can make that.
221	That is fine with me.
221	Just let me know.
222	500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.
222	One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000 and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.
222	The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically located in the same yard.
222	TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.
222	Karen was involved in this point.
222	56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
222	1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.
222	He will send an e:mail.
222	The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan: That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.
222	They were the only shippers able to use that point.
222	They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active status.
222	If any other questions please call DS
223	56943 TW-NNG Ward-- We need to leave as Bi-directional.
223	Will Fernandes called back and said they were mistaken and there are still one 8" orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to TW. They apologize for the confussion. Burlington Jackrabbit-- Olivia with Burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it. Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW?
224	I appologize for some confusion.
224	56943 Valero Ward -- is only a delivery and we do displacements.
224	1635 TW-NNG Ward -- is a Bi-directional point.
224	Jackrabbit we can inactivate.
224	Thanks DS
225	HL with Conoco let us know that the Zia plant will be down for maintenance Monday 28th for approximately 10 days.
225	They plan to route some of the gas to the Maljamar plant.
225	I told them they would have to stay within TW tarrif specs of 7# of water.
225	They will watch it.
225	DS
226	please see attached outages for march and april.

239	I do not.
240	Great job.....
240	Thanks
241	I can be available as well at 9 this morning.
242	We will need to watch pressures very close and manage horsepower so we do not exceed the 939#.
242	We need to set alarm limits.
242	Will keep you updated.
242	DS
243	Thanks
244	Will keep you updated.
245	Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.
245	We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman.
245	With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.
245	It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas control.
245	Mickey, hope this answers you questions.
245	If not call me.
245	Let us know.
246	This will be fine.
247	We are currently pumping north at P-3 to Mid-continent I/C's and Canadian.
247	How are you going to get enough gas to run the pig back to P-3.
247	We only have 29,000 flowing at NNG Beaver today.
247	If you have any ideas let us know.
248	Chuck Thompson is with PNM.
249	We need to get together on the digs between 4 and 5.
249	we will have to isolate the main and loop.
249	We will need to curtail gas from SJ.
249	I will look at the posting I had previously.
250	Is it Marketings plan to offer this as a Primary Firm point or an Alternate.
251	I second Jerry's statement below.
252	I talked to Delma with Amoco about the fuel and she is going to get with her people and call us back.
253	I will be on vacation tuesday, March 12 returning on wednesday.
254	We can check with Williams but can't promise anything.
255	yes
256	It will be fine.
257	I think these will be just fine.

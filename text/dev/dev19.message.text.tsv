1	Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.
1	The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.
1	You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.
1	You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.
1	You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.
1	In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.
1	Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score).
2	Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!
2	Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.
2	We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.
2	I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.
2	Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.
2	As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.
2	The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.
2	We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.
2	However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.
2	Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.
2	We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.
2	Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.
2	The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.
2	Our most important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.
2	While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.
2	If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.
2	Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.
2	We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.
2	Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.
2	We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.
2	As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.
2	I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.
2	I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.
2	Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!
2	If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.
3	I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.
3	The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.
3	So far things are looking good.
3	We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.
3	I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.
3	After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical moisture.

4	Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.
4	I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.
4	Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.
4	I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.
4	I'll try to call you and talk about it later.
4	If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding.
5	Credit cards that is!
5	- I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).
5	Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.
5	Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.
5	I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.
5	Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?
5	Let me know.
5	Love Hubby

8	Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.
8	90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.
8	I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.

Local News Crime & Justice Education Environment Health Legislature Lottery Navy News Neighbors Politics Special Reports Traffic & Roads Weather Your County Sports Economy News Wire Columnists Opinion Features Community Obituaries Classifieds Subscriptions About Us Extras Published: Thursday, August 23, 2001 Police follow naked man to pot crop By Brian Kelly Herald Writer CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday.
10	Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island.
10	The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out.
10	When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it.
10	An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.
10	According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop.
10	The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.
10	In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation."
10	Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants.
10	Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer.
10	In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life."
10	He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people."
10	The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.
10	Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.
10	Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment.
10	The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles.
10	The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

16	I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack.
16	I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.
16	About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.
16	She kept asking are you o.k.
16	and almost seemed to sympathize with me.
16	She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.
16	She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.
16	So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.
16	I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.
16	After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.
16	So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.
16	Then she said i didn't have any balls.
16	Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.
16	It was funny as shit.
16	She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.
16	Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.
16	I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.
17	thanks for the heads up kevin!

30	I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.
30	After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.
30	I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.
30	Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.
31	i have to set it up in sportsline.com - i'll have it done before the end of the day
32	I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.
32	They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.
32	We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland.

38	Any truth to rumor that Whitney Houston died of an overdose?
39	There is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.
39	As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.
39	If you are interested - read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
39	Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life!
39	U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM Friday, September 14, 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.
39	U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack.
39	But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.
39	The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said.
39	Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.
39	"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said.
39	"But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."
39	Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.
39	A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups.
39	But the official said no determination has been made.
39	"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said.
39	"As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."
39	Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks.
39	They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.
39	Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing.
39	Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.
39	The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign.
39	Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.
39	"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said.
39	"A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

57	I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.

64	Storey and I were talking about different places to look for coverages and insurance for death (regarding his father).
64	Were are some of the non standard (ie not life insurance) coverages that he should make sure he has checked.
64	His dad was on a business trip from Houston to NY.
65	Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.
65	No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.
65	I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.
65	Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.
65	On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving.

71	I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.
71	Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".
71	Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.
71	Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.
71	It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.
71	Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.
71	I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.
71	Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.
71	It was just as bad.
71	It tastes and smells horrible!
71	Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

77	When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid.
77	I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused.
77	Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary?
77	Thanks, Martin Cuilla

89	I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.
89	At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.
89	We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.
89	After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.
89	If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.
89	I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.
89	You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.
89	Thanks, Martin Cuilla

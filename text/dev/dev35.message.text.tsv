3	Thanks for your help and tell Amanda thanks.
4	Those things are such a waste of time- trying to condense 8 points of error and 6 weeks of trial in a 20 minute argument.
4	Bill did a very good job.
4	The opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did not go over well.
4	Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. law.
4	Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument.
4	I personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union.
4	The remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas purchase agreement between Union and the utility district.
4	In short, you didn't miss much.

9	Dude---- I will be in London in late July.
9	How far is it to Poland?
10	I have not recieved this document.
11	The JLM case has settled for the full amont of the claim--app.
11	$1.7 mm.
11	The KN case has tentatively settled for app.
11	$19.4 mm.
11	The settlement agreements have not been signed.
12	This may be of interest to you.
13	Please book my london flight.
14	Please put this on my calender
15	I will probably be staying at the Savoy.
15	I will be there from July 18 to the
16	Lets get together for lunch.
17	What about hiking the Pacific trail from Lake Tahoe to Yosemite in June/ July of 2000.
18	I talked to Mark Palmer last week about some other issues and casually thanked him for talking to you.
18	His response was somewhat disapointing: " I really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our Gov. affairs office, too bad they have no openings."
18	Sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering on rude behavior.
18	Take the transmission wire job, come repackage the deal to Enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from Enron.
19	yes
20	How about this Friday ?
20	Julie has not left yet.
20	She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks.
20	Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key----to start the 7th.
20	The schedule says the school starts the 14th.
20	Pretty funny.
20	How many years will it take her to live this down?.
21	Looks good---please send.
22	I have no legal issues---send out.
23	After further thought, it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation w/ American Coal, we should keep the documents.
23	To further insulate the Coal Group and you from any claim that Enron misused the information,I suggest that you transfer the information to me and I will hold it for safekeeping.
24	Today is bad.
24	Tommorrow I will call you.
25	Did you get my last message?
26	I am not aware of any reason to hold up the suit.
26	ECT is OK
27	FYI
28	Huh?
29	Yes if you can tell me who she is
30	Congrats on your new arrival.
30	I hope all is going well.
30	I had lunch w/ Bill Gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm.
30	I think they are shy about talking to current Bracewell attys.
30	I told him that I had talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made and that I would pass along the information.
30	If you are interested, Bill's # is 713--225--4500.
31	Open new matters.
31	Thanks.
32	Is this the usual way Freshfield bills?
32	Out of principle, I would ask for itemize bills.
32	Please give me your thoughts.
33	ECT is willing to pay 25%,but we will not agree to pick up any of EOTT's share.
34	Pay it.
35	Why not alternate between SG and Fulbright.
35	Flip a coin to see who goes first.
36	It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again.
36	The real question is :did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence w/ the future president.
36	Maybe this says alot for Bush.
36	He thinks Pat is as much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to take him seriously.
36	Wouldn't that be refreshing.
36	You need to get the real scoop before lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana.
37	The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain.
37	I guess Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six months.
37	There is really nothing more to it than that.
37	When we1) all get a little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it alot more.
37	No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save Yvonne.
37	I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid w/ you.
37	July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training school in Austin.
37	We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado or Calif. How about Canada or Alaska.
38	I never heard from him.
39	The attachment is wrong
40	It looks fine.
41	The list should be eliminated.
41	Just provide that the parties should mutually agree on an arbitrator, who must be a Delaware corporate atty.
42	This will confirm that HPL wants a jury trial.
42	Sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
43	Yes.
43	The position is still open.
43	If you have a resume, please send it.
44	The revised letter is fine.
44	Do we want to outline the damages we have suffered------ ie developement cost.
44	If so, do it in a general way
45	I think the list is unworkable because it requires us to do due diligence on all the attys on the list--a daunting task.
45	The suggestion of outlining several firms is a good compromise.
46	The arbitation provision looks good.
47	The KN matter has been settled.
48	FYI Also-- I talked to John Ale ,the GC of Azurix today.
48	They are looking for attys.
48	I don't know their attitude about recruiters.
49	Are you still coming to London?
50	I sent the materials(along with a recommendation) to Bob Williams, Enron International's Litigation Manager.
50	If you want to follow up w/him, his no.
50	is 713--646--6412.
51	I suppose that depends on your approach--weuns cowpokes aint got much use fer you folks in the big city with yer smooth talkin ways.
51	Seriously, Bob is hard to offend.
52	I will be in London attending the oral hearing in the CATS appeal.
52	I doubt I can attend.
53	I have attached a report I asked Tim to produce for me in anticipation of possible litigation.
54	This is our judge in the Beeson case.
54	I don't like him as a judge but I would recommend that we gave him $500-1000.
55	I am OK (but reluctantly) with the settlement.
56	This is the judge in the Beeson case.
56	Although I am not that fond of Link, I think it would be prudent to support him finacially.
56	I suggest $500-$1000.
56	Of course he will want more after the primary.
57	There is no litigation reason why this contract cannot be terminated as outlined in your email.
58	I am not sure about the purpose of this letter.
58	The better response in my mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door.
58	If we do send them a letter, and I leave that to you, we need to have already filed the petition.
58	Then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter.
59	Pay it.
59	Have a nice time.
60	Dude--- There has been a change in plans.
60	I am arriving on the same day(this Sunday) but I have to leave the following Sunday( the 25th) Let me Know your plans.
61	How long is this going to last?
62	Of all the weekends---Doug's and our family are both going this weekend.
63	Never mind the previous message.
63	I have no objections.
64	She did not recieve an offer.
64	Hope all is well.
65	Great job----I've got about 45 more for you.
66	I have no changes.
67	We kicked their ass.
68	Please let me know of anything other than Grynberg
69	I approve.
70	Please coordinate with Linda Guinn.
71	Sept. 1,3,7,and 8 are good.
72	John's # is 713-345-5263.
73	My litigation description looks fine.
74	I reviewed the release and it looks good.
74	Another victory.
75	We did get the money.
75	Thanks.
75	I asked Linda Guinn to look into the misc.
75	bills when we recieved it several months ago.
75	I can't remember what we decided but I will check with her again and get back to you.
75	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
76	We may be suing them.
77	Yes.
77	I invited Michelle Cash.
77	I have a meeting w/ Skip at 11:00 at B&P.
77	I hear you are in trial.
77	You name the time and place.
78	Sept 13 is good.
79	For this small amount, simply pay.
80	I cannot attend.
81	I am Asst.
81	Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America.
81	As the title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America .
81	I also have responsibility for litigation in Europe.
81	This job carries great responsibilities.
81	Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated more than 100%.
81	Need I say more.
81	In this job I am also, on occasion,when the mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about how she is conducting our litigation.
81	Suggestions are strictly off limits.
81	I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am breakfast meetings to answer associate questions.
81	There was a meeting at 7 but there was no breakfast served and no questions answered.
81	Sample question: "Richard, why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas" Response: "I'm glad you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office" What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed Bruce,they met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.
81	Personally,since I left the firm we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months.
81	Julie has gone back to school to get her Montessori teaching certification to be able to teach at Post Oak School.
82	I will be in Charleston all next week for a trial involving Cline Res.
82	Maybe you,Tim and I can get on a conf.
82	call.
82	How much is at stake?
83	Please get me new cards.
84	Set 17,Oct 13,19,20,22 are good
85	This is the correct address
86	Gosh---I'm blushing.
87	I think you sent this to the wrong person---at least I hope so because I have no idea what it is.
87	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
88	Does this mean you have heard from Rocky?
88	Dont give up hope yet--- there might be a position not under Rick Shapiro(wishfully thinking)
89	Are we running into a problem with the Nov. 3 trial setting?
90	Here is a message from Neal Manne about his availability for the Nov 3 trial date.
91	I do know them.
91	Great folks.
91	The lawyer for the plaintiffs--Patricia whatever is an awful person.
91	If it is not a bench trial i'll tell you more.
92	The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases.
92	She sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another.
92	One day I'm sitting at the house on Tosca when the phone rings.
92	Its her.
92	She must have seen my name on a list of residents.
92	She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on the loose in the area before.
92	Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and with less kids, I was in the yard all the time.
92	I knew the stray dogs.
92	I told her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they had a dog.
92	Needless to say I never heard from her again.
93	FYI I am no longer on the Board
94	Yes.
94	Send his resume.
95	Why are we meeting again?
96	Send Brenda---but don't spend too much time on it.
97	Yes-- I guess things don't move as quickly as you might want.
98	What is the status of this?
99	I gave you Matthews SS# several weeks ago.
99	Do you know what this is about?
100	I am getting the file together.
100	Unfortunately, I am in an Arbitration this week.
100	Does Jolen vs ECT ring any bells?
100	I will set it up next week.
101	Have we been paid?
102	I am OK with the settlement.
103	I sent it today.Please get w/ Bonnie ---she will handle but you make sure it is passed off to her.
103	Thanks.
104	I dont want to be the only one using a strike, but if others agree lets strike him.
105	Wed is OK.
105	Tues is bad.
106	Please set up a meeting for next week
107	I am in an arbitration all week.
107	Can you get together with the appropriate person(s) at PGE to find out about the hiring of Richard Carroll and report back?
108	Send me both Motions for SJ.
108	Thanks.
109	Non.
110	Please handle
111	It looks fine to me.
112	I've seen it and it still looks good to me
113	Fine.
113	What are the court costs?
114	I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke yesterday.
114	As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences between the parties.
114	The legal issue is one straight out of first year Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding contract?
114	When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned.
114	In response to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded simply "I agree."
114	But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging.
114	In other words I think we can make a good argument to get around the damaging " I agree" email.
114	It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email.
114	The Master Agreement provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must have 8 years of experience in derivatives.
114	I'll take my chances with that kind of panel.
114	I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range.
114	Let me know if you need anything further.
115	I am good for $25.
116	Actually if this case goes to arbitration, it will be in Houston.
116	Know any good lawyers?
117	X-large( and getting larger by the minute)
118	I am but your humble servant.
118	Wed and Thurs are good.
118	Check w/ Twanda--39402
119	We are mediating this case on Oct 25.
119	As a result, all depositions have been postponed.I will let you know if this changes.
120	Lets find out who their agent for service of process is and send it to them.
120	After that I say we drop it.
121	At this point have we dropped this claim?
122	Looks good .
122	Please send asap(and take all their phone calls)
123	Yes and no.
123	I am not listening on the calls, but either Andy or Barrett call me immediately afterwards to update me on the progress.
123	If they leave me a voicemail, I will forward it to you.
124	Last week, I offered $10,000 to allow us to stay put.
124	I have not heard anything back.
125	Either
126	Call him and see if we need to produce anything.
127	Are you still in charge of recruiting for the collection of assest formerly known as Enron International?
128	I sent a follow-up letter today.
129	Looks good to me.
130	I have no changes
131	I have asked Britt to follow up on this matter.
131	He will attempt to determine who are the targets of these letters.
131	He is also doing some research on whether the atty violated an ethical duty by sending this letter to Rick Causey and others at Enron.
132	I will call him.
133	Meeting.
133	Dave Duran and Michele Cash should also be involved.
134	FYI
135	I confirmed that all the LPs and GPs of ECT Securities LP are Enron cos, incorperated in Delaware with offices in Houston.
136	I owe you lunch.
136	Lets take Bruce so I don't have to pay for it.
137	FYI
138	I'll take any game except tonight.
138	Let me know if i've won.
139	No need to call.
139	My thoughts are: defeat his motion to stay,win our motion to stay.
140	Perfect
141	I just sent you the letter.
141	I'll be here all day.
142	I guess we will know on Tues.
143	We are going around and around with Sitler's attorney about the appointment of arbitrators.
143	The "contract", and I use that term loosely, between Sitler and Cgas calls for the appointment of 3 disinterested arbitrators.
143	Sitler has appointed a friend of his who we do not believe qualifies as disinterested.
143	The only claim Sitler should have is a request that the district court settle the dispute and order Cgas to appoint an arbitrator.
143	I have asked Bruce Oakley at Bracewell to call Sitler's atty and fish for information.
143	I'll let you know what Bruce finds out
144	Send them to me.
144	I dont think you need to review them.
145	Could you get w/ Eileen and let me know 1) which case this is and 2) what is happening
146	no
147	I registered for and attended the first day of the 3 day course on electricity that started Tuesday.
147	Unfortunately, I was summoned back to Houston on a work related emergency.
147	I would like to complete the class if it is offered in the spring.
147	Is this possible?
148	This action by the U.S. Supreme Court may be very good news for the Grynberg case.
149	Your revisions look good.
149	For the last paragraph,change this to "...Enron has not asked Enerstar to reimburse Enron's considerable expenses"
150	I'll be happy to schedule him.
150	What do you think?
151	Done
152	I want you to know that I really keep an eye on the restricted list in hopes that NSM will not show up.
152	I want to tell all of my family, especially my widowed mother who lives off her pension, to snatch up as many shares and bonds as they can.
153	Do you have lunch plans today?
154	Are you going to be here for Christmas?
155	Really?
155	I'd feel like a mooch.
155	Lets have lunch next week.
155	Any day but Monday or Thurs.
156	Tues.is good.
156	I'll call you.
157	Obviously, Barrett is already working on this.
157	Please coordinate w/ him.
158	We wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $250,000 and asked for $1 million.
158	It might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out.
158	We would certainly take less than $1 million.
158	What do you think?
159	I just got it this afternoon.
159	It is headed your way.
160	I must be getting stupid in my old age,but I can't understand this email at all.
160	I'll find you tomorrow so you can translate.
161	Do you have any more news on Natolie/IBC?
161	I am ready to get aggressive.
161	Also---We need to meet regarding Calpine and decide how to proceed.
162	Do we really need it translated?
162	Is Britt getting out of these translations, or does he still have to talk to the French attorneys?
163	Please handle
164	Linda Guinn has this information and will contact you shortly
165	I have already given Andy my input.
165	If you have comments , please call Andy before 1:00pm today.
166	Please give Andy your comments by 1:00pm today.
167	Can you print these out in color asap?
167	I need 2 copies.
168	He must be out of town.
168	In my dealings w/ him he has always been responsive.
168	He is not returning my calls either.
169	Can you handle this?
170	Please set up a conference call with Linda Green, me, and Shelia Tweed for early next week.
170	Linda Green may not know about why we are calling--- we have a potential search in Portland for a Power Plant development atty.
171	Janet Moore tells me that he could go back to EI if he wanted, but he doesn't want to travel.
171	Should we at least talk to him?
171	Mark--- have you found out anything about his reputation
172	FYI
173	Lets them pay by December 31
174	Can we talk about this if it is still an active "case"
175	Enron Europe has decided to pursue this claim.
175	How involved would you like me to be?
176	Please move forward on discovery.
176	Lets force them to the conclusion that they really need to get rid of Enron as a Defendant
177	Lets get a petition ready .What is your guestimate on our chances of success.
178	Those dates in April are OK for the electricity class
179	It is probanly too late to respond-- but her goes: 1.
179	We like AAA.
179	I don't know how good ASP is.
179	2.
179	I' d like a more neutral forum.
179	The question to ask yourself--are we going to get "hometowned" 3.
179	We do't usually provide for "loser pays" on attorneys fees
180	I thought these were taken care of long ago.
180	I think they relate to Neal's work for EES on the chilled water project for Enron Field.
180	Let me know.
181	Did you talk to her today?
181	what do I need to do to follow up?
182	Looks good.
182	Why does Jim McCartney think so?
183	When do you want to pay this?
184	No,just send the letter.
185	I am available at 2pm
186	I have asked Twanda to set up a conference call.
187	I have asked Twanda to set up a call to discuss.
188	Yes.
188	We have approx.
188	$110 k sitting with our attorneys in London and we have a claim under our charterers insurance policy----which we are pursuing aggressively.
188	You may be able to reserve some amount for this potential recovery.

191	Please pull a report detailing all incoming faxes received by fax machine number 713/646-3483, located between EB 3115 and 3114B from September 1 through present.
191	WE NEED THIS REPORT IMMEDIATELY.
191	Time is of the essence.
191	Should you have any questions, please call me at 35587 or my legal specialist, Linda Guinn, at 36104.
191	Richard Sanders Co. 413
192	Have you requested my upgrade?
193	This request is related to a lawsuit worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
193	Is there any way to get this done by Monday?
194	Thanks
195	Please take the precautions you believe are appropriate.
196	Paul- please find out what you can from the DOJ.
196	Thanks.
197	I have a Norelco razor.
197	Would that help?
198	I am forwarding a draft of the Amended Complaint in the TVA lawsuit.
198	The "control area" causes of action have added to our existing request for declaratory relief on the "delivery point" issue.
198	We would like to file this next week, so please review this asap.
198	My assistant is putting together a conference call for Tues afternoon to discuss.
199	Please send me his resume
200	Is this call going to happen?
200	I am available.-
201	Who are the new firms and what do you know about them?
202	I am fine w/ the bill.
203	Does this name sound familiar?
204	Good job on your conversation.
204	Unless Max wants to pay some nominal amount of money to simply get rid of them, I would advise that we do nothing.
204	We could write a letter confirming the substance of your conversation and warn them not to slander Enron,but I think that might be overkill.
205	I forwarded this to Derrick and Haedicke.
205	Why dont you send one out to every other GC.
205	Thx.
206	The interest rate is fine.
206	We do not agree to "loser pays" attys fees.
206	The arbitrator has discretion under AAA rules to award attys fees, so we usually leave it open.
206	I would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court for some relief outside the arbitration.
206	Please let me know if you have any questions
207	The phone call to Intermesa and Votorantim should emphasize the following points: 1.
207	The transaction was never consumated.
207	We have consistently stated that we do not consider the transaction a "done deal" until final documents are executed.
207	2.
207	We are no longer willing to consider the proposed transaction.
207	The reason is simple: the market has moved and they failed to act quickly.
207	3.
207	All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive.
207	Because Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final documents, it accepted the risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be willing to sign a deal.
207	4.
207	Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal.
207	Their only claim is that we misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they didn't pursue negotiations with a third party.
207	Our response is: we never made any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to rely on our negotiations as a basis to forego discussions with third parties when Enron never sent them a binding offer.
208	I would like to cancel,as long as my RC is not charged.
208	Unless I hear otherwise, I will asume this is ok.
209	yes, I will attend.
210	Can you get w/ Staci and take care of this request?
211	The requirement that all three arbitrators have 10 years of experience in unrealistic.
211	We will be hard pressed to find one.
211	Most arbitrators are lawyers.
211	With respect to the second change, it is not a change we should make.
211	This changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the arbitrators is our advocate, to a totally nuetral panel.
212	I think we have compiled all the information you requested.
212	Sorry for the delay.
212	Please call Linda Guinn at ext.36104
213	FYI
214	FYI
215	FYI
216	I just wanted to remind everyone involved with the TVA litigation (and potential litigation) to be mindful of the possibility that some of our internal communications in the next several weeks may be the subject of TVA discovery requests in the coming months.
216	Please do not generate any notes or e-mails without talking to me first.
216	When scheduling meetings regarding strategy, please include an attorney so that we can protect the communications through the attorney-client privilege.
216	If you have any questions about this procedure, do not hesitate to call me at ext.

217	After reviewing the petition, I think this belongs to EES.
218	I'm ok
219	The plans are up in the air.
219	The first weekend that we are all free is the weekend of Feb 26.(if you can't make it that weekend, let me know.) If all three of us come, there is probably 4-6 hours of work.
219	I would propose that we bring Ben,James and Ryan only.
219	I will arrive Fri night and leave Sun morning.
219	Let me know what you think.
220	I can't tell what changes he made.
220	Can you?
221	Both Sheila Tweed and I have concluded that Kristopher Wahlers is not a good fit for our position.
221	Do you have any other prospects?
222	Britt was going to check with all the Enron GC's.
222	I assume he got no response.
223	Your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money.
223	The other thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two transactions as well.
224	Have you received all the information you need?
225	Send it to everyone you believe should get it.
225	Unless I hear otherwise from you, I will assume you are going to send the letter with attachments today
226	I have pushed this meeting until Feb. We need to meet w/:Mcconville(2 hours after Barth),Barth( first meeting in the morning), and Travis.Please set up asap.
227	Please try to track this down.
228	Please call him and set this up
229	I am assuming this meeting is canceled.
230	Bill is a great guy but I have no interest in a presentation.
231	Sorry,but we have no interest.
232	I have no changes to the description
233	What time is the party?
234	Whalley's asst tells me the meeting at the Px is at 9 am.
234	I have left Greg a voicemail indicating that the three of us should talk today about strategy.
235	Yes to arbitration.
235	No to waiver of jury trials,unless the counterparty is in the Rio Grande Valley or some other bad venue.
236	I f you haven't already done so, please review the attachments.
236	Don't provide any feedback in writing or e-mails,simply talk to them on an unrecorded line.
237	We need to meet with, in this order, Brian Barth,Travis McCoullough,Kevin McConville and John Hopley.
237	Lisa Mellencamp may also want to attend the meetings with the attorneys from Millbank.
238	Does anyone know this guy and should we interview him?
239	Let me know what you think--obviously we need to decide quickly.
240	Please drop me a voicemail or an e -mail when you have the time.
240	I am out of town starting today.
240	Also-- I circulated the resumes of the two Canadian attys you sent to me last week.
240	If you have any more comments about them,leave that in the voicemail and I will forward it to Shelia and Julia.
240	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.
241	I have asked the headhunter to set up an interview through Twanda.
241	Remember- no panic shopping.
242	What is the status of my upgrade request that was made 5 weeks ago?
243	Thanks for yor message.
243	On another front, I will be in London next week and I would like to meet with the attorneys who will be pursuing the Pacific Valour claim.
243	Did we ever decide on counsel?
244	I dont care
245	I have asked Bruce Oakley for a status report.
245	I'll let you know when I hear from Bruce.
246	I am in London this week and will be meeting with David Best on Thurs to discuss.
246	Thanks for your inquiry.
246	I'll let you know after the meeting.
247	Actually, my instructions from Nowlan are to pursue our claim against MTM.
247	I am in London this week and I will try to meet with our London counsel to start the process.
248	By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to pull the Tapes before they are deleted.
248	Can you work with Linda and Ed to pinpoint the tapes we need to pull.
248	Linda's direct no.
248	is 713-853-6104.
249	Please send me a copy of the e-mail along with Kevin's response.
250	Bruce Oakley has informed me that we will be filing a motion to compel arbitration, which should stay Sitler's ability to take any depositions.
250	Either Bruce or I will let you know if it looks like the depositions will proceed.
251	In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity.
251	It is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction.
251	I would suggest the following language: The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable jurisdiction.
252	Is this case still active?
252	If so,what is the status?
253	Please print out this memo with attachments and place it in the Calpine lawsuit file
254	As you know, several weeks ago we retained an attorney out of Wahington DC to assist us with the EPA permitting issues.
254	The need for counsel was put on hold when we decided to move the plant.
254	Is ther anything more we need to do to follow up on this matter?
255	Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk?
255	He was the attorney from Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month.
255	All of the comments I recieved were very positive.
255	The last I heard, you were talking to him about salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation level.
255	Please let me know what I should do to follow up.
256	Am I signed up for the last two days of the Electricity class through the University of Texas?
256	Please put it on my calander.
256	Also there are several matters not on my calender--lunch w/ Skip Mcbride.
256	Please update my calender.
257	Actually, when I say "retained " counsel, I mean we identified the best lawyer available and asked him to clear any conflicts.
257	We don't need to do anything else.
258	Actually, I have a memo that will be finalized today.
259	I have attached final drafts of the Bonneville and Enestar response letters.

262	Can you take a look at this and let me know what it is and what we should do.
262	Thanks
263	I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) What a dreary place in the winter.
263	I dont have much to report.
263	I have been traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, LA, St. Louis, and now London.
263	Julie has held her tongue because of her impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer.
263	The kids are great.
263	Lots of sibling rivalries going I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour.
263	Garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline.
263	Worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days.
263	They are pregnant again and out of space in their house.
263	Missy Medary is running for District Court Judge in Corpus Christi.
263	She is running as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her chances are slim.
263	She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect.
263	Tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him.
263	Don't quote me on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with their 4 kids.
263	I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled.
263	I haven't seen anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day.
263	He works for a firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work.
263	I laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day.
263	He was always calling it Country Gay.
263	Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?
264	PLEASE SIGN MY NAME AND SEND
265	I will be happy to do it this way.
265	By the way, if you are sending a copy to Bill McCartney at V&E, you should know that I am also sending him a copy.
266	I have no comments on the two letters.
267	Thanks
268	Bob Williams has informed me that Christopher Carr represented the GOM against Enron.
269	Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case.
269	There is only one slight problem---we have no idea what case this is.
269	Neal Manne at Susman represented us in a case against Duke that settled early last year.
269	We have no active litigation or disputes against Duke.
269	My curiosity is pegged out.
269	I asked Bob Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries.
270	Thanks again for the hospitality shown last week.
270	I wanted to let you know that Fiona was especially helpful.
271	Cos 18 and 51 are the only ones I am familiar with and they cannot be dissolved.
271	I am not familiar with the other cos, but I have asked Linda Guinn to confirm that there are no cases pending against them.
272	I just left you a voice-mail stating that I am available this morningor(even better) Monday morning.
273	If you do not hear from Mike ASAP, track him down or leave me a message and I will.

277	I will be on vacation.
278	.After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to be independant.
278	We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands.
278	There is no "standard" promotion track.
278	If a senior counsel is successful, a promotion to asst.
278	gen.
278	counsel will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years.
278	There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC.
279	The posting of this bond should eliminate the need to pay on the Enron Corp guarranty.
279	Please refer all future correspondence regarding this matter to Bonnie White
280	Who is handling this?
281	The Demurrer looks good.
282	please print out this e-mail w/ the attachment and file
283	Yes I get these postings independently
284	Easter is good for us.
285	Easter weekend is MUCH better for us.
285	Just make it happen.
286	We left at 10:30 and went to Kenneally's Irish Pub to get something to eat( they ran out of food at the gala) I did bid on a piece of art, but I don't know if I won.
286	I doubt it, it was a popular item.
287	Thanks for the update.
288	The use of Enron's name is OK as long as it is limited to that.
289	The lawsuit against Agency.com was filed this afternoon.
290	Do you know anything about this?
291	Can you have lunch on Monday?
292	I am very busy and very important but I will make an exception for you.
293	Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them totaling over $8.5 million.
293	These cases are, for the most part , suits to collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses.
293	The likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small.
294	Where else?
294	Treebeards---on Market Square You pick the time.
295	Thanks for your research.
295	I hammered the old coot on the head w/it this morning.

299	When you get a second, call me and let me know what is happening with this investigation.
299	Also---are you going to Wyoming next week.
300	Roland-- I think that Brian is the correct person to sign these discovery requests.
300	Having said that, I do not remember talking about that before you sent the e-mail to Brian.
300	You need to go through me for that kind of decision.
300	My only comment to the Interrogs is that Brian should use his old title in
301	Paul-- plese call Lara Leibman at Enron asap.
301	Her # is 713-853-1393
302	Did you ever send this letter?
302	If so, please send me a copy.
303	I have not heard from Barbara about Eitan, but my reaction is that he is not a great fit because of his lack of legal experience.
303	Typically, we don't hire first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) them.
303	I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced.
303	However, I know that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical.
304	Linda-- see if Barrett Reasoner knows of a video conference in Houston.
305	In keeping with Mike Moran's instructions to be frugal, I did not book a video conference at Enron, but I have asked Linda Guinn to find one that we can attend in Houston.
306	The devil is in the details--- what does the power of atty say.
306	Send it to me
307	Looks good.
307	Let me know asap whether we get the requested extension.
308	Looks good.

315	for your amusement
316	please coordinate with Mark Wawro at Susman re when we will be traveling to this hearing
317	Don't assume anything--- as to what happened, maybe he got to know her work product.

349	Please set this up

351	I spent 3 hours on this matter in Jan, Feb Enron North America Corp.
352	I sent this to Mike Dorman at Locke Liddel for his analysis.
352	I ased for his answer by Thurs.

370	Greg-- We are not in the market right now.
370	Her credentials are good, but her timing is bad.
370	Thanks forthe resume.
371	As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court.
371	The opposing counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's firm.
371	She presents a problem for two reasons.
371	First,she is much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty.
371	At the prelimanary hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance) The bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband.
371	It is pretty pathetic from what Linda tells me.
371	He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the Judge.
371	Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
371	Thanks for your help.
372	I dont understand your message.Squires is the Judge.
372	Susan Myres is the opposing counsel
373	I cannot make it the 31st.
373	All other days are good.
374	Squires is not going to recuse himself.
374	However,he was not the judge who heard the prel.
374	hearing.
374	An associate judge--Brent Burg-- heard the prelim.
374	hearing
375	I can not make the call at 2:30.
375	I am available at 10:30-12 or after 4:30.
375	If the call can not be rescheduled to those times, please call me to give me an update.
376	Hi
377	The Beeson class certification hearing and the hearing on the parties' motions for Summary Jugdment have been rescheduled to August 8--10.
378	We need to send a cc to his attorney, Jim Keenan.
379	Sounds good
380	I would be shocked if HH did not have insurance for the line repairs.
380	We should ask their atty about this.
381	No. I already have plans that I can not break.
381	Try me next time with more notice, I am a very busy and important person.
382	I have a mediation that day.

401	Please send me a copy of the final version for my records.

410	"Laura Gibson" Please respond to lgibson
411	I have asked Linda to get back to you personally about the status of this bill.
411	"Bill W. Ogden" Please respond to bogden
412	Has Kemper signed the agreement?
413	I am good on the 25th Please respond to "Grant Dorfman"
414	I believe these invoices are ENA's responsibility.
414	Please send them back to me.
415	Doug and Rob--- I left a voicemail for Bob Williams that I thought Jim McCartney would be good.
415	Jim is an outside atty who consults with me and Bob on complex litigation.
415	He would be a perfect nuetral arbitrator.
416	I am not available on the 25th from 3-5.
416	Every other time is good.
417	one percent
418	Lets make sure what Durango is going to say, but I am inclined to call their bluff and proceed to trial.
418	Lets see what Steve Schneider has to say
419	Steve-- Kathy did call me about this and I did not follow up with you.
419	Sorry to both of you.
420	I do not have the PAC confirmation email.
420	Can you send it again ?
421	Sorry-- Twanda knows the drill.
421	We have a temp.
422	4 things: 1.
422	You are right ---something is off about this guy.
422	His behavior is irrational.
422	2.
422	You are right--- you are obsessing about this too much.
422	Relax and go back on vacation.
422	3.
422	I handle personal matters for people all the time.
422	This one is pretty minor.
422	If it becomes more involved, we can talk about it then.
422	4.
422	Relax and go back on vacation.
422	I will talk to you on Tues.
423	Can you go to lunch next Tues, Wed, or Thurs?
424	Please put this letter on my letterhead and lets send
425	I don't know what the deal with Doug is.
425	Maybe we are a lot more aggressive than you when it comes to inviting ourselves on his vacation.
425	I knew he was going to be there.
425	Late last week, Julie and I decided to go to Austin instead of her coming to Houston for the weekend.
425	I called Doug and told him we were coming.
425	My approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance to to so.
425	He didn't say no.
425	I should have called you earlier.
425	Julie must have told me to call you 5 times on Sat.
425	The truth is I am so freaking tired that I just didn't do it until Sun.
425	We did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time.
425	Love Richard
426	V&E represents us.
426	Thanks
427	Unless their is a reason having to do with the case( ie we can somehow recover our attys fees} I see no reason why we should separate the bills.Send me one bill.
428	I am now not good on those days.
428	Friday is good or any day the next week.
428	What about dinner with me and the kids any day this week?
429	As you will note from the attached e-mails there is some confusion regarding this bankrupcy.
429	I have asked Linda Guinn to coordinate with you to make sure Enron is doing everything we need to do.
430	I am the logical person to speak with B of A. I need to speak to Joel or Lisa to put B of A's request in perspective.
431	I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to help gather the documents.
431	Her # is 713-853-6104.
432	Please coordinate with Milbank to get the requested documents under #5
433	Have him send it directly with a cover letter to me.
434	Yes.
435	Did you know about these?
436	I talked to Delainey last week and he said he wanted to have a meeting to discuss.
436	This analysis is interesting.
437	Sorry about the delay in getting back to you.
437	I would do a separate heading.
437	I am not sure who needs to approve this other than me.
437	When Whalley was head trader and COO, he approved.
437	I do not know if it should be Lavo or Delainey.
437	If you know, send it to me and I will get it signed.
437	If you are uncertain, my paralegal, Linda Guinn, will find out.
438	If this letter has not yet gone out, we should include the kitchen sink of perceived problems.
438	I agree that the letter should be short, but lets eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.
439	I will call you about this matter this week.
440	Has any action been taken on this request by Shankman?
441	I am fine with the Chamber of Commerce arbitration, especially in light of the small amount of potential exposure.
441	Could you send me a copy of the opinion from our local counsel.
442	See Below
443	Please send the following e-mail addresses and telephone #s to bwhite@ me Bruce Oakley at B&P Steve Pruett at Enron
444	He is taken care of.
445	Yes.
445	I am the contact person at Enron.
445	The LLGM attys should send me copies of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers, counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed.
445	As for contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them directly for incidental information.
445	Any strategy calls should be made through me.
445	I would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial calls w/ the ECP witnesses.
445	I wil;l likely decline because of time constraints.
445	Is that as clear as mud?
446	This disclosure is fine.
447	We could agree to non exclusive jurisdiction in Tenn., but not exclusive jurisdiction.
447	As for the arbitration forum, my preference would be a major regional metro area--Atlanta comes to mind.
448	Send the drafts at the same time.
449	New matter
450	yes
451	Lets meet Monday at 9:30
452	Dinner is better.
452	I have all three kids this week because Julie has finals the week after next.
452	Hows Tues, Wed, or Thurs.
452	We eat kinda early(6:15)
453	The Wauna and Halsey PPA's with Ft.
453	James have been cancelled.
453	Sorry for the delay.
454	Welcome back.
454	Do we need to set up a meeting to discuss the tortious interference question we talked about before you left?
455	For your review and comment.
456	please call me about this if you still need help
457	Disregard the previous e-mail.
457	this is the updated version.
458	Even though I have not seen te bill, I do have a concern that it will prevent us from making our 3rd Q earnings.
458	How bad is it?
459	Fine
460	Just testing you.
460	(youpassed)
461	Please respond
462	Our plan is to be in Ft.
462	Worth by Fri the 11th at 5pm.
462	I was hoping to get together w/ Rob and Amy and Scott and Elizabeth on Sat.
462	night.
462	What about Frior even better Sun.
462	night
463	Please set this up for Mon morning
464	Linda-- Please check with Stuart Kusin at Susman whether we agreed to return this material.
464	Otherwise tell Kevin to archive it.
465	Call Steve Williams at EOG Resourses in Denver or Barry Hunsacker in Houston
466	Lunch w/ you---yes.
466	Presentation----not only no but hell no.
467	I have not heard anything about it since I spoke with you last month.
467	My guess is Mark is not focused on this search.
467	Don't do anything.
467	I will keep you posted Please respond to makris
468	This letter could have negative ramifications.
468	However, we should send it if El Paso mismeasured the gas.
468	What happened to the conference call?
469	I will
470	I am sorry that it took so long to get back to you.
470	My paralegal, Linda Guinn, is the best person to answer these issues.
470	Her ext is 36104.
470	By the way, we are not revising our policies.
471	Bonnie White is handling Dodson case and will respond
472	yes
473	What is the last day for Deen to ask for a jury?
473	"Bill W. Ogden" Please respond to bogden
474	yes
475	The check made it to us this time.
475	My paralegal,Linda Guinn, is tracking down where it went.
475	I am certain the $ was deposited.
476	This rider looks good.
477	Actually, I said I did not think we should pursue it, but that I wanted Harry to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it go.
477	We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about.
477	Any word Harry?
478	Ron-- I am not sure what this is?
478	Can you help me?
479	The signed aff.
479	is on its way back to you.
480	I don't remember seeing this.
480	Please resend.
481	When do you think we will here something ( if today) ?
482	If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA related to the control area dispute.
482	.
482	While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron has no damages because of the FERC ruling.
482	What are our chances of winning?
482	By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to comment on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.
483	I know you have other things going on but can you draft 2 short letters to JB 1)confirming your requests re Wisvest and 2) outling you information requests re Ecogas SA.
483	I will edit.
484	Include these questions to JB in the Ecogas SA letter
485	Can you print out a copy of the legal risk memo E. Sager did?
486	....or unless the judge has scheduled a conference call for a time certain.
487	You are exactly right---thanks.
488	Can I bring my grandmother?
489	No on #1.
489	Yes on #2.
489	One thing we may want to add in light of #2 is a confidentiality agreement so that Jung Ho doesn't find out about the settlement.
489	"Bill W. Ogden" Please respond to bogden
490	Tim is available next Thurs.
490	Does this work for you Knox?
491	Sounds good
492	I have not had any contact with the nuetral appraiser, so this speculation is from our outside counsel.
492	Jean Frizzell inforns me that the nuetral is conservative and he doesn't believe that he will put any multiples on these investments.
492	The numbers should be low.
492	I hope you are doing well-----
493	I am forwarding this lawsuit to you.
493	Can you handle?
494	We should not respond.
495	Can we get together next week so I can get an update?
495	Twanda will schedule.
496	Remember us?
496	You're not going Sharolyn Wood on us are you?
497	Where are we on this?
498	I talked to Britt about handling this.
498	You can give it to him if you are swamped.
499	Perhaps $150-250 per well is what they are looking for.
500	I am talking to Bill Redmond
501	That is the plan--although she doesn't need my family, she can always hang out with the Cowan family
502	...
502	unless I am around someone really important---like a Judge or her family.
503	Do these two e-mails relate to the same litigation I sent to you?
504	Send it out yourself
505	Not that I am aware of.
505	I will check with our corporate Sec.
505	Becky?
506	It looks good.
506	By the way, we have had dealings with Carter Mathes before.
507	I have been told that Exxon/Mobil is going to file a lawsuit against ECT, Kinder Morgan and Enron Liquids Holding.
507	Have you recieved anything
508	I have not followed this.
508	Should I ?
509	I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has been filed.
509	I am fairly certain there is no new filing.
509	However, the Plaintiff's discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at NSM Management Co. acted improperly.
509	I wouldn't close your file yet.
510	Set up a meeting with the accounting people w/knowledge of these figures asap
511	I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for depositions.
511	Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel Levin 216-928-0600.
511	They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk them out of it but they insisted.
511	I instead suggested a telephone interview with limited depositions to follow.
511	Please call me Tues about this.
512	I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a messaging system that won't let me leave a message.
512	That's ok today because I need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of you when I need to.
512	I wonder if Bracewell's Wash. office has the same problem?
513	Joe-- How long can we hold off on this?
513	I have left a message for Dan Watkiss to call me about helping us with an anti-trust analysis.
513	Maybe you should also be on that call.
514	He's a goner and he is a Democrat.
515	Bob-- this is mine
516	Janette: Please order a new IBM laptop computer for Linda Guinn as soon as possible and charge to my RC 0630.
516	If you have any questions, feel free to contact me or Linda.
516	Thanks.
516	Richard Sanders
517	Janette: Please also note that we will need to move the printer currently located in Marianne's cubicle to the litigation war room on 5.
517	Thanks.
517	Richard
518	I never did anything to follow up on this.
518	Do I need to?
519	Have you heard anything about the schedule for the hearing in the CATS appeal?
519	I need to travel to London soon and I would like to attend.
520	Maury called me on Wed and I forgot to call him back.
520	I called yall this am but no one was home.
520	Tell him to call me.
521	Robert and Scott--- what should we do about this.
521	Please call me at 713 853
522	What do you think we should do?
523	I have asked my asst to set up a call to discuss.
524	FYI

526	FYI
527	Somehow, I have lost your telephone no.
527	I was going to call you to get an update---or do you have anything to tell me?
528	yes
529	Thanks for your help.
530	Matt
531	Yes.
531	Let me know where and when
532	please handle
533	In case someone calls
534	Twanda-- please create an e-mail from me to Delainey, cc to Haedicke say "I have enclosed a draft of a the letter we spoke about yesterday".
534	Put this insert from Bob Madden in a letter from Delainey to Ike at TVA-- Delainey's secretary has the name and address of Ike.
535	Send them to me
536	Yes, take it.
536	Thanks for your help.
537	I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to respond to your inquiry.
537	Her direct # is 713-853-6104.
538	I am too busy and important to go on such short notice.
538	Seriously---just pick one of the dates I gave you, even if it is a long way off.
539	I have sent you revisions of this letter
540	Lunch as you proposed sounds good.
540	Thanks in advance for waiting for me.
541	The verdict is I have too much #*%$@ work to do( not for forwarding)
542	Tell her I have no objections.
543	I have forwarded yor e-mail to Michelle Cash.
543	Hopefully, she can answer your questions
544	I cannot open the attachment.
545	Jim has known about the dispute since June, but I can't remember whether I called him about the lawsuit.
545	I left him a voicemail 5 minutes ago.
546	The questioning by the panel did not reveal their intentions.
546	The attys who were there think that the case could go either way.
546	We should know in 2-6 weeks.
547	Yes.
547	The re line says dinner at Johnny Isbell's house.
547	Can the kids come?
548	Can you get me these two articles by Fri?
549	I need this printed out on my stationary ASAP fri morning.
549	Thanks
550	Bob---- are you now in charge of EBS---put another way are "You da Man"
551	The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in a folder.
551	E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year.
551	The policy has many benefits.
551	First it clears up computer storage space.
551	The policy can also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where a Judge has required the wholesale production of e-mails.
551	Imagine if we were required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic.
551	This has happened to a number of companies in litigation the US( who have subsequently changed their retention policies).
551	Frankly, the Microsoft antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy.
551	In that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and others.
551	It is unbelievable what some people will put in an e-mail that they would never dream of putting in a "written" document.
551	As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved.
551	Please check with your source.
551	I am happy to discuss any questions you have about the policy.
552	Please schedule ameeting w/ me, Randy Maffett, Roland Tellis at Milbank and Steve Hamilton at Ecogas(if Randy says we need him) to discuss the Waste Management case
553	Mike, Gary,and I are contacting the generators(Duke, Dynegy, Southern, Reliant, and Williams) today to discuss their approaches.
553	Should we contact any retailers?
554	Please provide your comments asap
555	I did not get this
556	Are we still on for Sun night?
556	I will let you decide where we are going.--somewhere near you is fine.
556	6- 6:30 is best.
556	We will be with the kids.
557	Janet Moore speaks very highly of Denise.
557	please let me know if you have any interest.
558	I had some problems with the atty at Vinson & Elkins who I sent your file to originally.
558	I sent it to Josh McMorrow at Bracewell & Patterson.
558	He will be up to speed on Monday-- he is doing his homework on the corporate entities today.
558	His telephone # is 713-223-2900.
559	Please set up a call w/ me and Gary Grote(McConville's atty) for early next week
560	Sounds good
561	After you signed off, we set up another meeting---Fri the 13th at 11 am.
561	Letr me know if you can't make it.
562	Where can I get a copy of Ken Swaisland's guarranty.
562	I want to send a demand letter.
563	The sixth line in the first paragraph still refers to a "limited" production.
563	Otherwise the letter looks good.
563	I am still waiting on Management so don't send yet.
564	ENA Management has signed off on the letter.
564	OK to send.
564	Thanks for all your hard work.
565	Please call me about this.
566	I am interested in buying tickets but I am unsure when I want to go---are the tickets for a date certain or are they open as to when I can use them?----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 10/08/2000 09:07 AM -----
567	I still have not received a copy of this.
568	Please handle if you have the time.
569	Are you kidding?
569	It is Columbus day-- there is no one to be found at the PUC.
570	I am not a big Soussan fan.
570	Zimmerman would be best.
571	Another job well done(at least for ENA/ECT)
572	I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to get you this information.
573	I would much rather meet at a bar, but either Ballard or I will be there.
574	Max-- I asked Bonnie White to assist me on this matter because I have been swallowed up on another project.
574	Bonnie is with the Enron Litigation Unit and spends most of her time on ENA litigation issues.
574	I know what is happening and I am still very much involved.
574	If a lawsuit is filed Ileana Blanco at Bracewell will be our trial atty.
574	Her role is small at this stage.
575	Looks good.
575	Call me when you have a second.
575	713-853-5587
576	Sorry Bob--too late, this case belongs to you.
576	Seriously, I have asked Britt Davis to help me sort this out.
576	He has been heading up the effort to (finally) get rid of this case
577	I don't know the Merit case.
577	As for Badack, ENA has filed suit and moved for Summary Judgment on liability.The hearing will take place in the next month.
577	On Thursday Oct 12th, I met with Badack's outside attys re settlement.
577	Badack offered $2.375 mm.
577	ENA's last offer was $5.0mm.
577	We agreed to exchange additional offers.
577	Is this update enough?
578	Thanks for the resume: however, we are not in the market for a litigation paralegal.
579	Mark Haedicke and I would like to talk to her.
579	Lauren Prescott sent her resume to Chuck Cheek and she is scheduled to talk to them.
579	I have left a message with him to find out when Cheryl is going to be in the building.
579	Please call Twanda Sweet to set up a time (853-9402) Please respond to makris
580	Could you please try to stay out of trouble.
581	Are you no longer involved?
582	It is a fairly complicated matter---Britt Davis is in the best position to explain the status.
582	He will call you.
583	FYI.
583	Dow Jones had a story on our lawsuit.
584	I think we are in favor of the idea depending on what we buy.
584	Frankly, the kids don't need anything there.
584	What the house really needs are pots and pans.
584	What is the suggestion?
584	I don't know when we are coming---our lives are too hectic right now.
584	Give me a call when you get a second.
584	I tried to call you today.
585	Please let Linda know what is happening.
586	I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money becuase Schwab began charging a $15 per quater account fee.
586	Does anyone have any suggestions about where to put it--other than in Doug Hester's college tuition.
586	The account is up to(down to) $8500.
587	This message was garbled.
587	Can you send it again?
587	To: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, steve.c.hall@enron.com, Richard Sanah Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides, Tim Subject: Proposed Answer of CMUA's Complaint As you have already heard, California Municipal Utilities Association filed a complaint with FERC asking for cost based rates.
587	The following is a briefoutline of an EPMI/EES answer to the complaint.
587	The answer is due Friday.
587	Please send me any comments ASAP.
587	?
587	The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the Commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to requirecost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems currently faced by the California markets.
587	We should attach our white papeto our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could bsolved at little or no cost to the customers.
587	?
587	I list here, for your information, the reasons CMUA claims that markets are not competitive (these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading).
587	?
587	2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load.
587	?
587	zonal constrained prices, even in the off-peak hours, do not reflect competitive outcomes for low load conditions.
587	?
587	even small players can be price setters ?
587	The changes required are additional generation, transmission, and demandresponse and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periodsof time to implement.
587	?
587	There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates ithe near future.
587	?
587	CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring, the Commission has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at market-based rates.
587	However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wherthere has been market-based trading of electricity before electric restructuring, since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool,scontract in 1991.
587	The Commission,s rules didn,t create the wholesale market in the past, the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up by certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper.
587	The problem is not the market-based rates.
587	The problem is the market rules.
587	?
587	CMUA,s motion does not address how market-based rates would be calculated for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources, let alone reflect the trading of basis points.
587	Almost all of the power EPMI sells ispower it has bought from some other marketer or generator.
587	Many of EPMIdeals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identitof the seller until after a deal has been struck.
587	Accordingly, EPMI gets ninformation about the cost of the underlying generation.
587	?
587	If FERC doesn,t try to fix the market but simply takes away our market-based rates, since there,s is no basis for us to set cost based rates, we would go out of business.
587	Besides there,s no reason to take away ourmarket-based rates because we are not exercising market power.
587	So if FERCcould fix the problem with a less onerous solution (as we,ve proposed in our white paper), requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taking of our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutionastandard.
587	CMUA does not provide any expert testimony to support its position.
587	Ratheits evidence is &drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered by the California ISO and other public sources.8 Beyond the difficult evidentiissue posed by the fact that CMUA cannot swear to the veracity of information produced by third parties, EPMI would have no opportunity to conduct discovery or cross-examine of such &witnesses.8
588	All of Thursday morning is good.
588	How long do you think this should take?
588	Lets meet Wed.
588	at 3:00.
588	I'll hold both of these open until I hear from you.
589	Steve Allen at Buchanan Ingersol in Lexington KY.
590	Please arrange this
591	Do I really need a paragraph?
591	One word-----Litigation.
592	Wed.
592	the 1st of Nov. is good.
592	Same time and place?
592	Please respond to nlorentzatos
593	Can you attend the meeting and the conference call?
594	Kevin Presto
595	What is this?
596	no
597	I have set up a conference call at 11:30 on Monday to discuss.
598	FYI
599	The e-mail should suffice as an official policy.
599	Let me know if you need anything more.
600	The answer is yes but I would like to hear from Barbara or Shonnie before I give you the go-ahead.
600	Ladies?
601	I have a trip to Portland scheduled for the 2nd and 3rd.
601	What about the week of the 6th?
601	The 6th, 7th, and 8th are especially good.
602	Lisa-- this looks fine to me but you have a better feel for what you want.
602	I would keep a close eye on the bill( perhaps a maximum amount Millbank can bill)
603	Bonnie-- If you have not already done so, we should gather our documents Linda-- Please coordinate this effort
604	Bonnie white, an Enron inhouse litigator, and my paralegal, Linda Guinn, Will gather the requested documents.
604	Linda--713-853-6104, Bonnie---713-853-7244
605	My paralegal, Linda Guinn, will call you about this--- which is another way of saying "my dog ate my homework"
606	Although I would love to allow someone else the opportunity to participate in this project, it makes more sense for me to be the Enron rep.
606	What do I need to do to begin the transition?
607	The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida law.
607	Have you looked at Fla. law?
607	With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point.
607	Please look at the limitations issue in light of what you know.
607	An extensive review of the depositions doesn't seem warranted to me.
607	I would also suggest we enter into a Tolling Agreement w/ Power systems ASAP.
607	Call me to
608	This works for me-- please confirm if the call is going forward
609	The attachment opened
610	Yes.
610	She is ex-Bracewell and I know her pretty well.
611	The 8th at 8:30 is good.
611	The extension is fine as long as it is short.
612	You should now have both.
612	If not, call my Asst, Twanda Sweet, at 713-858-9402
613	Call me about this
614	I cannot get into the system---please send me a paper approval sheet
615	Yes we won, but no we shouldn't change our response.
615	The Judge sent us aletter with his rulings, but has not signed an official order.
615	In fact ,lasweek the judge heard the Plaintiff's motion to reconsider and stated that his letter was not an order.
615	In light of this, I would leave the description thsame.
615	Your thoughts?
615	To: Gary Peng/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Litigation and Other Contingencies Disclosure Richard: I'm sure I must be wrong about this, but it was my understanding(second-hand hearsay, at best) that the trial court ruled in our favor against class certification after remand from the Supreme Court.
615	If I amindeed incorrect, sorry for wasting your time with this message--just disregard.
615	Thanks, Rex.
615	Gary Peng To: Rex Rogers/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Re: Litigation and Other Contingencies Disclosure
616	I'm OK
617	yes
618	My title is Assistant General Counsel.
618	Otherwise, the letter looks good.
618	I asssume you will send me an original.
618	Please respond to "Sandra Yamane"
619	Please make sure Gary and his people are included in interview process.
620	Although it is always a moving target when you try to interpret Randy's e-mails, when he says "more realistic" numbers, I think he is talking to you.
620	I thought I heard that 1) Sterling's case was weak and 2) she has hired a more reasonable atty.
621	Can you look into this
622	Yes
623	yes.
623	How much
624	yes
625	A qualified yes.
625	It doesn't look to me that we have much choice.
625	Remember--we were withholding freight as leverage to settle, which is a short term strategy at best.
625	I am going to discuss it in detail w/ Britt Monday morning.
625	I'll let you know if we come up with a better plan.
626	lets talk about this Wed
627	I have sent the contract and release to Pintail's atty.
627	I expect to receive it back anytime now.
628	yes
629	The changes are fine.
630	Bonnie is an in-house litigator for Enron who needs Kevin for another lawsuit.
630	Obviously, you will have access to him also.
631	Did you ever get an opinion from V&E?
632	I forgot to put in a signature block.
632	Otherwise, it looks good.
633	Just a note to say thanks for putting together the class reunion.
633	We had a great time.
633	It was nice seeing you and your kids.
634	whatever you want
635	The objections look good.
635	I have asked our PR dept to comment on the letter to Harvey.
635	I will get back to you when I have heard from them.
636	Everyone has signed off on the letter.
636	Go ahead and send.
637	Don't send anything until we talk.
638	Please put me in line for a flu shot.
638	I would like one as soon as they are available.
639	Lets have a conf.
639	call w/ you, me, and Mike Day on Mon.morning.
640	The status of the case has not changed.
640	On Monday the 27th the court will hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability.
640	We expect to win.
640	Badack is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery.
640	I predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million.
640	We have offered $4.5 million.
641	The only one I am aware of is Kimball,which Lisa is handling.
642	yes
643	Did you get everything you needed?
644	Can you confirm that we corrected this?
645	Sorry for the delay.
646	What information, if any, do we owe him?
647	Please review and let me know if you have any comments.
648	Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
648	I have asked my asst, Twanda 713-853-9402, to set up a call for tomorrow.
649	I agree that we should send such a letter.
649	Also-- I talked to Mike Beatty and he is willing and able to serve as our party designate arbitrator.
649	I told him that Neal would follow up with him on the details.
650	none
651	Looks good
652	In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company.
652	Anyone else?
652	If so, please contact Michelle.
653	Address this to Robin Gibbs for my signature.
653	Thanks.
654	As you can tell from the time of my e-mail, I am getting crushed.
654	Please ask her to be the contact person.
655	I am sending you a letter from their atty.
655	Call me to discuss.
656	Has Liz finished with gathering the documents?
657	My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative.
657	It seems like alot of busywork.
657	My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting.
657	However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly.
657	The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459.
657	I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.
658	Call Bob's asst and see if I need to participate.
658	I was supposed to be on the last call, which never happened.
659	Please coordinate the payment of the City of Vernon bill from my RC.
660	Wendall-- the litigation matter involving the City of Vernon needs to be broken out and sent directly to me.thanks
661	Can you call him about this?
661	I wouldn't worry too much about the tone of this letter or stepping on his toes.
661	Jim overreacts at times.
662	I gave it to Linda Guinn 713-853-6104.
662	Unfotunately she has alot going on.
662	Why next week?
663	No. How about I call you at 4pm?
663	I only need 10 min.
664	Do you know this canidate from your Jackson Walker days?
665	I have reviewed the response and I agree with the "home run" approach.
665	I want to make sure that you and Robin are completely comfortable with this document since we may see it again.
666	Dont worry about getting the press reports.
666	Our PR dept has that covered.
667	We are still in litigation with them.
667	We are the plaintiff but we are not interested in pursuing it.
667	The outside atty is Phil Bruns 650-8805.
668	I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to look into the status of the bill and get back to you by Tues.
668	Her direct no.
668	is 713-853-6104.
669	What do you think about Bill as a trading atty?
670	I haven't talked to my boss about it yet- I need the right moment.
670	I doubt that listing is us.
670	By the way, thanks for the t--shirt.

679	Gail Brownfeld is leading up this effort.
679	I have forwarded your message to her.
680	The deposition will not take place.
680	I talked to the litigation manager at WM about settlement today.
680	We are going to talk again Monday.
681	Ther is no such litigation.
682	Ther are no such claims or liabilities.
683	Did you ever have any doubt?
684	Both letters look fine.
685	I think our response should be to engage in discussion if Grynberg is serious.
685	We should know shorttly whether he is.
686	Yes
687	I would leave him a voicemail anyway.
688	206,500,000.
688	I'll send you a $10 check.
689	Please send our response to Euell to her,Vickie, and John Nowlan.
690	Bonnie--could you call him and find out what this is about?

696	He is out until Dec 27th.
697	Pay them.
698	I have signed several approvals for her but I am not sure why they are coming to me and not you---this must be proof that you are still under me on the org.
698	chart and that I am still your boss.

700	We should cc Pat Long
701	Looks fine.
702	Andy Edison will be helping you with this matter.
703	Berry should go to Lydecker
704	I agree
705	Are you handling this?
706	The 18th w/ Sat possibility is better.
707	I sent the resume to Michelle Cash, who now heads up recruiting.
708	This is not a strong prospect.
709	Andy-- send those materials I gave you to Lisa.
709	Jeff-please send all future pleading to her as well.
710	The main problem in getting him paid was that Blakes didn't send me his bill until Nov. We have processed the bill and he should have already received his money.
710	I will call Larry today to apologize.
711	I never received this.
711	Is it mine?
711	Subject: Service of process The following original documents, received today, have been forwarded foryour immediate review and consideration: Trustmark National Bank v. Freddy Martin ) EOTT Energy Operating, LP, Garnishee; No. 98-0183, In the Circuit Court of Smith County, Mississippi.

711	Becky A. Stephens Litigation Unit, Support Services Coordinator
712	I have attached an e-mail from Steve Howard, our atty in the NSM litigation.
712	Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.
712	Let me know if you are interested.
713	Any thoughts on this question?
714	Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case.
714	I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program.
714	Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter.
714	His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School.
714	Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife.
714	Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold.
714	I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me.
714	At the time, Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $500(gross) per week.
714	He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets.
714	Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce.
714	Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight.
714	Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree.
714	Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current.
714	Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived.
714	Felix let her go.
714	He has not seen his daughter in two years.
714	Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa.
714	His mother in law denied him access.
714	Last month his ex-wife died.
714	I wrote a letter to the mother in law asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix.
714	An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist.
714	Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on his case.
714	Please let me know asap whether you can help.
715	I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your voicemail that you are out.
715	Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do.
715	I will be in Portland next week if you want to talk about this matter.
715	As far as the request to Avista, I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do.
716	71 to Columbus.
716	I-10 to Houston.
716	Loop 610 south(right) for about 5-7 miles(past the Galleria and Highway 59).
716	exit Bellaire Blvd(second exit after you cross over 59).
716	stay on the access road through the Bellaire exit.
716	the next light past Bellaire on the access rd is Evergreen---take a right.
716	We are on College st, which is the first street after the only stop sign on Evergreen.
716	If you get to S. Rice you have gone too far on Evergreen.
716	Turn right on College.
716	We are the 3rd house on the left--546 College.
716	Tel #
717	Any idea who this is?
718	This is an ENA issue.
719	You should go to this.
720	As you will note from the attached e-mail, Bernard Glatzer is now pro se.
720	It is only a matter of time until the case is over.
721	Thanks for your note.
721	Let me know if their is anything I can do.
722	I have sent your VM to Andy Edison for handling.
723	I am scheduled to be in Portland this Wde and Thurs(the11th).
723	Sorry.
724	Do you have everything you need?
725	What interest rate are we being charged?
726	Call me when you have a second--713-853-5587
727	Britt-- I can't find them.
727	Either Wayne Gresham or Gail Brownfeld has them.
728	Andy-- I am leaving for P{ortland this afternoon.
728	Can you get w/Grant and address John's question
729	Where are we on this case?
730	My asst, Twanda Sweet, will get them for you.
731	One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million.
731	As you will recall, this representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we were in CA last month.
732	As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas.
732	Robin Gibbs had always predicted that this was the likely result.
732	We will now proceed with the battle over class certification in Kansas, which,unlike Texas, is not necessarily appealable.
732	I will keep you posted..
733	yes
734	Thanks.
734	What do you mean by "seriously"
735	Please direct all future e-mails to "your vice-presidentship"
736	can you take care of these---I have no idea what this or the ones following are about.
736	Should I deny the requests?
737	Thank you and congratulations to you as well.
738	Are you getting this?
738	I would listen in on the first call, but these calls are worthless (for you) for the most part.
739	Have you talked to Felix?
740	For your amusement---
741	Thanks again for your help.
742	I am in.
743	He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that case.
743	He never told me that he would be filing anything.
743	In fact, he asked me to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were still looking at what to do.
744	I am sorry I am so late in getting back to you.
744	It has been a rough week.
744	It looks like SoCal Ed.
744	and PG&E are really going to file for bankruptcy.
744	We have been working around the clock to review all our contracts with them and attempt to minimize the damage.
744	I will call you tomorrow to talk about how to get your team involved.
745	I approve.
746	you are now in charge
747	Yes.
747	You pick me up.
748	All yours
749	yes
750	I have asked Doug to set up a mediation
751	correction-- yes I know about it, no I don't need any help( I think)
752	If it is your dad then ok but if I see you face in an infomercial, I'm going to be pissed
753	I just left you a message Callme 35587
754	My first choice is Carrin Patman or Bruce Oakley at Bracewell--Tel.
754	no.
754	713-223-2900.
754	My second choices are Ron Welch and Knox Nunnally at Vinson And Elkins #713-758-2222.
754	Lastly, Barrett Reasoner at Gibbs and Bruns #713-650-8805.
754	Of course if TransCanada is already a defendant, I might recommend different counsel depending on which judge they drew.
754	If Duane has any questions please have him call me at 713-853-5587.
755	Becky-- have we been served with this case?
755	I have not received it.
756	Whatever happened to this?
757	There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon.
757	They did not give us releases.
757	The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will be happy to answer any other questions.
758	Can your LA office get a copy of this?
759	I had a long conversation w/ Brian Glasser and Bruce Americus yesterday about the Eastern case.
759	Here are some comments Bruce made in light of our discussions.
759	Call me if you would like the more detailed download.
760	I have called you 5 times for lunch.
760	Don't you know how important I am?
761	All future correspondence should be addressed to "your vice-presidentship"
762	Twanda-- send our report to Bob as well
763	Sempra is the parent of Southern Cal.
763	Gas.
763	It has no relation to So Cal Edison.
764	You can give the opinion.
765	I want you to run the call at 1 pm
766	Steve Howard's attachment outlines Farrallon's claims against Enron.
767	We have been asked to join in this filing.
767	Any thoughts?
768	I have been buried with your state's energy crisis and have not had a chance to look at it.
768	I would like to go to dinner on the 7th.
768	Do you want to meet w/ McConville while you are here ?
769	Thanks for your help.
769	Did you ever talk to Jim/ Rob about how to handle international?
769	Should we set up a meeting like we discussed?
770	It should.
770	I am not sure what game they are playing.
770	Maybe it allows them to argue their block forward positions should not be liquidated because PG&E is not in default to the PX.
771	Any day this week
772	Why don't we file a lawsuit in state district court in Houston, serve them, and wait for their counsel to appear or take a default.
772	We need to force them to respond.
772	Let me know what you think.
773	I just left Derrick a voicemail so I should have an answer shortly.
774	Out of Florida would be better(Atlanta) but Miami is fine.
774	I can't speak to whether Fla law is good or not.
774	Sorry.

810	I talked to John Barr at Bracewell and asked him to get in touch w/ the Power System attys and find out what is going on.
810	More to come.
811	How about around lunchtime?
811	Seriously,12 is good.
811	Where?
812	Gary---I think you should write the PX a letter asking:1) where this $ went, 2) whether the Core performance bond has been paid and where that $ went,3) whether the State has paid them any $ for the block forward positions, 4) has a claim been made on the CTS performance bond and is it still active given the State's action, 5)How did they calculate the $17mm chargeback they sent us, 6)what other $ has been collected to minimize the chargebacks If anyone has anything else they think we should ask the PX please send Gary and me a note.
813	We have no objection
814	Are we set this week?
815	Sorry for the delay, but we can't make it.
815	Very busy and important you know.
815	What about next weekend(fri)
816	Friday
817	Looks good.
817	I would send it from me to Lisa Urrick at the PX instead.
817	What do you think?
818	Enron's press flak is Eric Thode 713-853-9053
819	Looks good.
820	I approve
821	I will attend.
821	Don't ask me for any $.
822	In spite of the raging litigation, I agree with Bob.
822	I am not very interested.
823	Frankly, I don't remember it.
823	Ask Linda.
824	Are we sure this is an investment and not the name of their earnings strategy
825	I would involve Michelle Cash or someone in Enron Corp who deals with labor/employment issues.
825	I am surprised this issue has not come up before.
826	I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer.
826	I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise separate this company from Mother Enron.
827	I am scheduled to be in London next week.
827	I would like to sit down and talk to you about this.
828	May I please have a flat screen?
829	I have called TVA's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about the settlement.
829	here is theconfidentiality provision.----- Forwarded by
830	It is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision, it is the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued.
830	Gary Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.
831	Can you send them the info please
832	Ben Jacoby 713-853-6173
833	Unfortunately, I will not be coming after all (it looks like we have it covered w/Jim,Robin Gibbs, and Mary Nell) However, I would like to sit down with you at some point and discuss Europe's litigation management strategy.
833	Hope all is well.
834	Please send this to Mark Manela by e-mail.
834	Mark--- thanks for the gift but as I indicated in my voicemail to you last week, Enron's policy forbids me to accept this gift.
834	Thanks again.
835	We have been sued in Cleveland.
835	Do you know any good commercial litigators?
835	Boutiques are fine.
836	Robin or Jeff----Please call me after this conf.
836	call and let me kow whether there are any developmments.
837	please let Ann K./ Barbara G. know about this case
838	Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000.
838	If only he knew how hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron.
838	Although I did not talk to him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any offer.
838	Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press on.
839	If we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit, we should do it soon.
839	Where do the traders stand on pricing/ MTM exposure?
840	Thanks.
840	I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky.
841	That all depends on your definition of the word"job."
841	It was actually anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI litigation, a fact we already knew.
841	Are you at the Sempra deposition.
841	how is it going?
842	When is the dinner?
842	Iam free the 16th , 23rd and 24th
843	Sorry,I can't make it.
844	Don't forget to call.
844	My curiosity level is high.
844	713-853-5587
845	Sounds good.
845	How much T&E does Bruce have left?
846	Does anyone know which atty is working on this?
847	Which atty is working on this?
848	John Odam has asked me to go to lunch w/ his new partners.
848	Would you like to go?
848	If not, how interested are you in sending them work?
848	I think John is a great guy but he did a marginal job representing EBS on some litigation I was managing.
849	I am checking
850	This memo looks good.
851	I cannot make it the 6th.
851	The 5th is fine
852	The 4th looks good for now
853	Please make arrangements to leave on the afternoon of the 4th and return the morning of the 6th.
853	I will stay at the Marriott.
854	We are ok with the representation
855	I will be out of the office next week on Spring Break.
855	Can you participate on this call?
855	Please report what is said to Christian Yoder 503-464-7845 or Steve Hall 503-4647795
856	What is the status of this?
856	I agree with your analysis.
856	However,If the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on to our collateral?
856	Is that question now before FERC?
856	What happens if we lose at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here?
856	I would like your and Gary's thoughts.
857	There is a conference call on Monday that I have asked the Quinn Emanuel folks to participate in.If anyone else wants to participate, contact Bill Urquhart.
857	I am out on Spring Break but can be reached at 713-410-6128 or
858	I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville.
858	I have just left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept.
858	You will notice that it is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter.
858	I doubt it is effective.
858	Feel free to call Glanville if you like.
858	His no.
858	is on the document.
858	Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 3rd.
858	I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up with him.
858	Linda's no.
858	is 713-853-6104.
858	Gary Grote's no.
858	is 713-650-3131.
858	Of course you can always call Kevin.
858	I am on spring Break but am checking messages.
858	My cell no.
858	is 713-410-6128.
859	I took an online course last month and would like to take another.
859	I have forgotten my password/id and I can't login.
859	Can you send me an enail with this info.
859	Also-- I have lost the course # for the seminar I took last month entitled " Ethics For Inhouse Lawyers" which was a 3 hour course.
859	Could you send me this?
859	Thank You
860	I need you to take the lead in devising a strategy for how EPMI should respond to these requests.
860	I will send you another on that Lisa Urick at the PX sent to me.
861	In devising a strategy, it would be helpful to know what requests are out there.
861	Can you get someone to put together the best list we can?
862	I need to get the form to show compliance, but I cannot get it online--I cannot remember all my passwords.
862	Can you get this form for me?
862	Thx.
863	Please put this in our database
864	I know you have worked hard on this so I hate to start with a complaint........but this announcement is not the greatest.
864	First, there is no link on the e-mail to make the trip to the site easy.
864	Secondly, I tried the website address on several occasions with no luck.
864	I am now giving up.
865	Thanks for the update.
865	Andy will be handling this one.
866	I know of no reason why we could not deliver this opinion.
867	When I try to approve this, I get a message that the approval was already assigned to Michelle Cash.
867	What gives?
868	When you RSVP to the Enron Legal Conf, our company no.
868	is 0413 and our SAP/rc is 105656
869	I notice that Chris Healy and his partner are going to argue the motion to stay.
869	Are we ok with this?
869	Also--could one of you call me after the conf.
869	call and let me know if anything important is discussed.
870	Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824.
870	I am not sure I want to coordinate that much, at least yet.
870	Key Corp refused to wave conflict for several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of it.
870	Do you think that if I went to Cleveland and talked to Schultes, perhaps with a business person, that we could get out?
871	Thanks
872	If you want to be on the plaintiffs
873	yes
874	I found these in an old unused directory
875	Looks good
876	I am available--what are we meeting about ?
877	We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th.
877	Why not bring them all.
877	We can get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will) As for the Perd, we are definitely coming.
877	I invited John and Yvonne but they cannot come.
877	Doug and Susan may be coming.
877	Someone needs to call Steve and Jane Ellen---would you do this.
877	We will come Fri.
877	morning.
877	I have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this Easter egg hunt is all about two times and I cannot make heads or tails of it.
878	Are you handling this?
879	what is this case?
880	I agree
881	Now I remember.
881	Call me if you get this in the next 20 minutes.
882	Please make sure my Cont.
882	onepass account is credited and my Marriott rewards account.
883	My check is on the way.
884	What are you planning on doing with them?
885	I am traveling to LA on Tuesday and will not be back until late Wed.
885	night.( Plus, your sister lives way the hell out of town) Any other time you are available?
885	I'd love to show off my kids.
886	Can we talk about this when you have a second?
887	Did you do this?
888	Did we ever destroy these tapes?
888	Also-- I am assuming that NGX is well covered and that you don't need any help.
888	If not, please let me know.
888	Perhaps I can get info from Mark Powell--by the way is there some sort of fashion trend in Canada invoving shaved heads?
889	Have you met Mark Powell from Canada?
889	You should make a serious effort to get to know him since you are Mr Canada.
889	He is here for 3-4 weeks more learning about the Home Office.
890	What gives?
891	The draft Response looks good.
892	Milberg Weiss is the main plaintiffs' counsel.
892	They are a well known (and good) securities class action plaintiffs firm.
892	The John O'Quinn of LA---Tom Girardi-- is the plaintiffs' atty in the somewhat related gas cases.
892	These are not PI types per se, but more commercial litigation plaintiffs firms.
893	Sounds great.
893	If you are going there from your office I might want to catch a ride.
893	If not, I got the directions and will see you there.
894	There are no issues with making the litigation reps and warranties.
895	Jim-- Andy Edison is getting up to speed on the matters he did not already know about We should be in a position to meet with you next week.
895	I have also scheduled a meeting with you for next week to talk about NSM counsel and California.
896	Andy Edison is handling this matter.
896	His extension is 57105.
897	I am not sure why, but I would like a copy of the opinion--- probably for the same reason I slow down in my car to look at an accident.
898	file it but check w/Carl Ekland at Leboef in Denver to make sure we understand the risk
899	looks fine
900	Is it still April fools day?
901	What I meant to say is this request by Rebecca that Duke pay for her atty and be allowed to interview her has to be someone's idea of an April Fools joke
902	Andy Edison is handling cc: Lisa Robichaux/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: Service of Process Please see attached memo.
903	This looks good to me
904	my response is the same
905	For you to handle
906	I will be with Michelle in South America
907	By copy of this e-mail, I have asked my Asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting with your team, Andy, and me to talk about it.
908	That was our original plan---at this point I have no way of knowing---but I would guess that we would be arriving Fri morning.
908	My life is not my own right now because of the crisis in California.
908	Last night, I was named as the Enron rep.
908	to the Pacific Gas & Energy creditors committee--a totally thankless and time-consuming job.
908	I may be leaving for CA tonight.
908	Either way, Julie will be ther on Fri.
909	Please handle
910	3's all around
911	I would like a spot
912	Thanks for your e-mail.
912	Since I talked to Jim, I have been sucked into the California energy crisis and am not concentrating on the workouts just yet.
912	I will let you know if we should talk at a later date.
912	I have also forwarded your e-mail to several other attys
913	Thanks for your help on this.
913	I have asked Twanda to set up a meeting to talk about all the matters you have and the potential insurance coverage for the Cleveland case.
914	I have asked Andy to be your contact on this
915	I gave this to Gail to handle.
915	She in turn is getting Bob Vote to handle.
915	In the documents I received yesterday, I only saw an application for writ of garnishment, not a signed order--do you have one?
916	I gave you what I thought were 4 copies of this pleading yesterday and sent what I thought was 1 copy to Bob Vote.
916	As it turns out, there may have been separate garnishments against several Enron entities.
916	Please get Bob to track this down.
917	I have called Jim
918	That depends on what this is---I can't tell from the e-mail.
918	I have asked Gail to follow up with you and Bob
919	I am reviewing my ethical obligations to see if I can pounce on this reward.
919	Steve Hall Sent by: "Report mailer problems to Please respond to Steve Hall
920	Lets talk about it
921	The report was not attached
922	Andy Edison, ext 57105, is now handling the HEOF litigation.
923	Have you seen this?
924	I can answer almost all things California---but I don't know what I am supposed to do(and I don't want to write anything) I'll wait to hear from you.
925	Sounds good
926	As you can see,I have stepped up my level of coordination with PGE legal on California.
926	Let me know if you here anything else from Stan Horton.
927	This is good news---for once.
928	Your resume was not attached to your e-mail.
928	I don't have any openings in Enron Wholesale, but I will send your resume around.
929	I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a call w/you to talk about this
930	The timing for bringing in Quinn Emanuel is all wrong.
930	We need to get through some procedural motions and see where we are before we add a firm.
931	Thurs of next week looks good
932	Looks good.
932	I would call him before you send it.
933	Can you take care of this?
933	My understanding is that we should send this to El Paso.
934	I am ok.
935	Is this you?
936	Make sure you tell Scwartzenberg.
936	I hear he is kinda a pain in the ass.
937	If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they clearly should not be renewed.
937	What are the SCE LOCs for?
938	Can you get your asst to set up a call with Kathy for Wed, Thurs, or Fri?
938	Thanks
939	I will leave this to llgm.
940	You have this--right?
941	Harry---Please find out exactly what they are filing---get a copy of it if possible and lets set up a conference call to discuss.
942	I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf.
942	call on this for Friday.
942	Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything.
942	Bill- I heard today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge our setoffs.
942	Any news?
943	Please set up a call for tom.morning.
944	Please set up a call for Fri afternoon
945	You are a wonderful boy and you are welcome.
946	If I am giving you too much info, let me know.
947	I am confused.
947	I asked that the $720 be billed to my acct at the Houstonian---but I do not know my member #.
947	Is Kidventure going to get the # from the Houstonian or do I need to do something?
947	Please let me know.
948	I am thinking about coming from Houston for this meeting--- depending on the agenda.
948	What is the agenda?
949	I did not get an attachment ALEXANDERSON/ENRON@enronxgate, Jim Armogida/ENRON@enronXgate, Michelle Blaine/ENRON@enronXgate, Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate, Jan Harris/ENRON@enronXgate, Elizabeth Labanowski/ENRON@enronXgate, Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Marc Communications, Douglas Nichols/ENRON@enronxgate, Janet Rex Rogers/ENRON@enronXgate, Molly Sample/Houston/Eott@Eott, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank Sayre/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John@SMTP@enronXgate, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, StephenWilliams/ENRON@enronXgate, Randy Young/NA/Enron@Enron, Walt cc: There were no changes to the Weekly Report.

950	I will hold off on contacting Charles Bone, the influential Ten.
950	atty we talked about, until I hear from you that we need him to call the Ten.
950	AG.
951	I thought there was a pre-meeting at 9:00 am?
952	I did not participate in the call last week because I thought it was only concerning financial consultants.
952	Shortly before the meeting,a more detailed agenda arrived by e-mail(which may be par for the course but I find irritating).
952	Please find out 1) what was decided and 2) what is the agenda for tues.
952	Thanks
953	This letter looks fine.
953	Please send me a hard copy.
954	In case you did not have this,Fairbanks is our contact re stolen property.
954	Freddie took the property
955	Please find out what is happening
956	Are you coming to the Enron Legal Conf.?
956	I would really like to sit down with you and talk about the strategy for managing Enron Europe's litigation.
957	Please follow up asap.
958	Please arrange
959	For some reason, I can't open the attachment.
960	Jim and Mark --- Gail and Ross Rommel at A&K did a nice job on this.
961	I would be interested in how to prevent LC's from being paid.
962	Twenty percent of the golfers always drop out at the last minute and you end up with more threesomes than foursomes.
962	You should reconstitute the teams.
962	There are three benefits: play is faster,teams are more balanced,and you get to know more people.
963	It all depends on what the letter says---but I am sure it is fine.
963	I am here this am.
964	Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation.
964	When we originally hired Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience..
964	Some in the group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews & Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at FERC.
964	I clearly think we made the right call in this regard.
964	However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job.
964	If that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview like the rest.
964	The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get the job.
964	That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the group.
964	Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are absolutely sure they are the best there is.
964	I have talked to the attys for both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position.
964	I think we need to talk about this at length.
965	I am available.
966	I noticed from the attached report that the ExxonMobile case is set for trion June 25th.
966	Since I have not heard from Jim Armogida or you about the casI have assumed that you have it covered and that Corp has determined that the potential liability lies at the Corp level.
966	If this assumption is wrong, please let me know asap.
967	Thanks.
967	Frankly, at this point, it is anyone's guess how this will develop.
967	Given your distance to Spokane, Is there a local counsel that you would recommend---one with good ties to Jugde Whaley.
968	This looks good to me.
969	The Intratex disclosure looks fine.
969	Check with Rex Rogers about what he wants to do about disclosing California litigation risk.
970	Looks fine.
971	Please do not send me any other solicitation.
972	I called her twice but never heard back from her.
972	If she is not calling you, I say let sleeping dogs lie.
972	Have you heard anything?
973	I don't know them.
973	Anyone else?
974	The meeting has been cancelled.
974	There will be a conf.
974	call on Thurs.
975	Give me some details on the prices and I will run it by our traders.
976	Any thoughts?
977	As I indicated in my VM, I will be in LA early Tues morning.
977	Would you like to talk about the isuues before your meeting--or would you like me to go?
978	I never got this.
978	Does it belong to me?
979	Me too!
980	You know Mark Haedicke well.
980	The meeting on the 9th has been cancelled in favor of the Thurs call.
981	I will be in LA LA land
982	The Beeson description in the "Litigation" section in fine.
982	I have also reviwed the description of the California crisis and it looks good.
982	I have asked Gail Brownfeld to review the India description.
983	Please put me on the same schedule as Bob Williams
984	I will take a spot.
985	Twanda Sweet will coordinate with you to get the dial in number..
986	Yes
987	How about 8 am PSTon Fri?
987	I will call you.
988	This looks fine.
989	Are you available?
990	I approve.
991	I did not get the attachment.
992	Should we set up a meeting next week w/ the coal guys and Indiana counsel?
992	Do you want me to come?
993	I will not be attending.
994	It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th.
994	I heard from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for one-half day.
994	That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from Cleveland, we should make good use of this time.
994	I think we should schedule an entire day.
994	Let me know your schedule.
994	I have forwarded Larry Oscar's letter regarding Durrel Metal Products/Sterling foundrey to Mike Smith and Bob Williams(713-646-6412) at EES.Bob is my counterpart at EES Let me know if they fail to respond.
995	I would like to attend if possible.
995	If not--good luck.
996	I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting w/ you, Jeff Dasovich, Jim Steffes, Mike Kirby and Robin Gibbs for Monday or Tues.
996	regarding the strategy to deal with Sen. Dunn.
996	Should we include anyone else?
997	Is it too late to take credit for this?
998	These folks should also be on the Sen. Dunn call
999	No thanks.
1000	Just a late note to say thanks for taking a few minutes to meet w/ my friend Richard Gruber a couple of weeks ago---he described it as a productive meeting.
1001	Is it too late to help you on your antitrust question?
1001	I am around all week.
1002	Just a quick note to say thanks for hooking up with my brother Steve.
1002	He is a pretty talented guy and I hope he can help you out.
1003	Can you forward me some information regarding the French firm we discussed last week?
1004	I asked my asst to set up a meeting w/ you( it has been set up for the 22nd).
1004	I am trying to get a better handle on the Neg CTC's--how they are earned/accrue.
1004	She should have set it up for your office.
1004	I will come to you.
1005	Can you give me a quick update that I can send to John Nowlan re Vinmar and the other case( I cannot remember the name of the case)
1006	After your arbitration is over, can you give me a quick (and short) update on Pacific Virgo that I can forward to John Nowlan.
1007	Two Questions for you Mike: 1) What relationship does Sen. Dunn have W/ Aguirre or Milberg Weiss---has hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?
1007	2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to the materials given to Sen. Dunn.
1008	Both
1009	I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry.
1009	Obviously, I am heading up the overall CA litigation strategy for Enron.
1009	Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead trial counsel in all the CA cases.
1009	He is out of Houston.
1009	Mike Kirby was hired as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit.
1009	I have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely with me and Robin.
1009	Is this as clear as mud?
1010	What position should I take?
1011	thanks.
1012	Enron opposes the official ratepayers committee.
1013	Two names:John Quinn at Quinn Emanuel and Susman Godrey(LA and Houston office)
1014	Thanks for your response.
1015	I am planning on attending.
1016	Call me when you get a second--713-853-5587
1017	I need to talk to you confidentially about something---can you correspond by e-mail?
1017	If not, call me 713-853-5587
1018	After further reflection, I do not think I am the right person to call David Boies.
1018	Can you assign the task to another person?
1019	1 pm my time.
1019	I will call you.
1019	Is that still good?
1020	yes
1021	Yes, if I am in town--- I may be in LA.
1022	I think I will be out of town---can you attend Andy?
1023	approved
1024	Thanks for your quick response.
1024	I have relayed this information to my friend and am waiting.
1025	Yes.
1025	Please talk to me about the schedule.
1026	Thanks
1027	Thanks Stuart Zisman 05/21/2001 02:15 PM To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Gordon Grimes I spoke with Gordon.
1027	The assets that he knew about were ones that we have already looked at.
1027	I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of his notifying us about them.
1027	I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or whether we have given up on them.
1027	Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.

1029	I need Linda Guinn To have VP authority to approve invoices as outlined below.
1030	FYI
1031	John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter.
1031	He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved.
1031	I have attached the Boies firm response.
1031	I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release.
1031	The release may be shortlived.
1031	Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty.
1031	Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case.
1031	What are your thoughts?
1032	I approve

1095	ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.
1095	No reply has yet been received.
1095	We will monitor.
1095	2.
1095	Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.

1095	We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.
1095	So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.
1095	We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.
1095	At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

1100	Yes-- but lets wait until you and I can talk live.
1101	Please include on our database
1102	Can you make sure that this goes to El Paso.
1102	I assume that we dont need to do anything else(?)
1103	Disregard my previous messageabout this case.
1103	Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
1103	This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.
1103	Cogen Technologies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the Atkinson matter in mid April.
1103	I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective late February 2001.
1103	El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to represent Cogen's interests.
1103	We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.
1103	This matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.
1103	David Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this incident.
1103	We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if any such obligations exist.
1103	The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and to Compel Inspection.
1103	This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.
1103	I have asked Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or NEPCO.
1103	To date, we have not.
1103	However, I expect that service of process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.
1103	As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate the claim in your usual manner.
1103	Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.
1103	Thanks.

1158	Are we doing anything on California and do you need my input?
1159	I have asked my asst.
1159	to put a meeting together.
1160	I gave this to Michelle Cash.
1161	We now have a refund order from FERC which I have not yet read.
1161	The issue of ENA's liability is, as you would guess, complicated.
1161	Are we still on track for a short meeting to discuss?
1162	what does this mean?
1163	Jim--- I have talked to Tim.
1163	He is ok.
1163	Call me if you have any Q's.
1164	This is our judge in Sacramento.
1165	Should I do anything about this.
1165	It is getting ridiculous.
1166	The atty was transferred to me from Haedicke's office.
1166	I have no idea where they got Mark's # and name.His name is Dave Parkinson 801-323-3208.
1166	He is out of Salt Lake City.
1167	FYI.
1167	This meeting has to do with the Calpers "investigation" of its JEDI investment with Enron.
1167	As you know, Willie Brown is the mayor of SF.
1167	The city of SF is the lead plaintiff in one of the class actions.

1176	This is ok.
1176	Lets review them in the SF Enron office.
1177	One Mary Jane Smith.
1177	As the memo says, these are rumours.
1178	Probably not If it is for NSM we might have it in McConville's old files.
1178	If it is Qualitech then I don't have it.
1179	Did this get any press?
1179	If so,send me any articles you may have.
1180	Whatever happened to this?
1181	thanks
1182	Only if you say I have to.
1183	I am the soccer coach for Daniel and the asst coach for Ben.
1183	Our weekends are booked up until early Nov. Can we schedule a workweek for the?
1183	Sorry.
1184	Sorry I have been less than diligent in getting back to you, although I tried to call today.
1184	As David Burns may have told you, I was active at first(when I thought my role as comm. member was limted) I have not been active lately because almost all the lawyers involved in this case seem to only motivated to prolong the case.There is alot of money being spent on nothing.
1184	Now I see this Budget.
1184	Unbelievable.
1184	I am available tomorrow aft.
1184	please have your asst.
1184	call Twanda Sweet 853-9402 to set it up.
1184	Have you talked to anyone else?
1185	I am pathetically and pathologically late in getting back to you.Sorry.
1185	Enron is very opposed to this.
1185	Can we talk at your convenience today.
1186	thanks, we have it covered
1187	Boy did I blow this.
1187	Have you come and gone?
1187	If not, should we invite David Runnels?
1188	did you draft a demand letter?
1189	Sounds Fine
1190	Can you guys handle this in my absence
1191	I am assuming that this is just an FYI.
1191	If so, dont respond back
1192	Andy, can you call her re Berry.
1192	Thanks
1193	If you have not already done so,can you get back to Jim.
1193	Thanks
1194	Please get to the bottom of this and report back to me.
1194	Thanks.
1195	Sorry for the overreaction on Fri.
1195	I was having a very bad hair day.
1195	It seems like no harm, no foul.
1195	I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on this issue.
1195	I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surprised that Mirant had voted in favor.
1195	Can you call Brian Holman and see where they stand.
1195	If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call them and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to be on the conf.
1195	call thurs.
1195	Can you make sure I have the #s.
1195	With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter.
1195	Please let me know if the proposal changes.
1196	If possible, don't sign a lease until I get back.
1196	If you need a immediate answer, let me know.
1197	Please print this article for me.
1198	I don't shop at Tom James.
1198	Please take me off ypur e-mail list.
1199	I have been out of the country for the last week, but am in today.
1199	I am available anytime this AM.
1200	What is this about?
1200	I am here all week.
1201	Thanks for the update.
1201	Is the hearing still on?
1202	Can we talk about this today?
1203	I am coming in Mon.
1203	morning.
1203	Let me know if there is any change in the schedule.
1203	Thanks.
1204	Yes.
1204	I will do so.
1205	Yes.
1205	XL.RC#105656
1206	Gail Brownfeld has assumed responsibility for the case.
1206	She will contact you.
1207	no
1208	What about Midland or (worse) Galveston ?
1209	Two answers:1) I don't think you need one--you can file anywhere in the Southern District, 2) a desire to get crazy judge, like Sam Kent.
1210	What case is this and why is it still in front of Whaley?
1211	Yes, please.
1212	This time is good for Enron.
1212	We will talk to you then.
1213	I am trying to set up a conf.
1213	call today at 10:30 central to speak to the Chicago attys.
1213	Andy is not involved in this case.
1214	Will do.
1214	Hope you feel better.
1215	Did you switch this?
1216	In the short term(one week), we need to lean on him.
1216	In the longer term, he is out.
1217	Please include in my directory.
1218	This also
1219	I can't make it but I would like to catch up on the discussion later.
1220	The problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter.
1220	I think we should vote with our overall theme in mind: the PX participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good.
1220	Is that clear as mud?
1221	As you attempt to reschedule, just remember the crying faces of ten 5 year olds when Coach Sanders isn't there to lead them on to victory.
1222	Gareth Bahlmann is doing a big financing and I participated in a California due diligence call last Thurs.
1222	w/ the bank's atty, who happens to be Gary Orloff at Bracewell.
1222	Gary wanted to see our proof of claim.
1222	Can I get a copy?
1223	I have it as brianp@aiglincoln.com.
1223	No".po".
1223	Did you leave Susman?
1223	Saw your picture on the Texas Lawyer---almost fell out of my chair.
1223	Have you parlayed this fame into something else?
1224	Thanks for the update.
1225	I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today.
1225	We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs.
1225	to go over the answer and any other pending items.
1225	He promised a draft answer by 3 pm central on Wed afternoon.
1225	Hopefully, Paul will be well by then.
1225	I will set up a call-in number for the conference..
1226	Please set up this call.
1226	Rick McCombs in at Mayer Brown in Chicago.
1226	Also--get his direct no.
1226	and address and add them to my directory.
1226	Thanks.
1227	Is this call still being held?
1228	I assume that you have handled this.
1228	If not, let me know what I (we) need to do.
1229	I want playoff tickets but am undecided about next year.
1230	I left you a voice mail this am.
1230	Check it
1231	Are you ok?
1231	Can you make this call?
1232	Our attys are at Lebouef, Lamb in New York.
1232	I cannot get them by e-mail or phone..
1232	We probably need to postpone.
1233	Lets talk at 9:30, if only to reschedule
1234	That is probably our lawsuit.
1234	Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) is an Enron LLC with Calpers-- the California State pension fund.
1234	Lets take a look.
1235	I'd like to attend.
1235	Please get w/Twanda.
1236	Fyi.
1236	I told her not to go because we had too many other problems.
1236	I do need to develope a plan to deal with FCPA.
1236	I would like to mninmize her involvement, but fear this will upset Derrick and Walls.
1236	Any suggestions?
1237	Can't make it.
1237	That is my son's third birthday.
1237	Maybe I should bring him and the rest of my family(and inlaws) and try to pass it off as a joint celebration.
1238	No, I agree we should file on Monday.
1238	I would suggest that we reschedule the conf.
1238	call for friday am--7o'clock.
1239	We should file on Monday, absent some compelling reason.Let's postpone the conf.call until Friday---same time.
1239	I need the draft answer by 2 pm central on Thurs.
1239	I cannot have a Thurs afternoon call.
1239	Is Rick McCombs available on Fri am?
1240	Fyi.
1240	It looks like Jim is becoming more informed if not more involved.
1241	I talked to Jempy about this last night.He don't want another meeting.
1241	We have a new canidate in the hard-ass client category.
1242	no.
1242	I am listening now.
1243	yes, but if it screws everything up, don't move it.
1244	fine
1245	Please sign me up for the 19th at 1:30 or 3:00
1246	I tried for 10 minutes to sign up before giving up.
1246	This has to be easier.
1246	It seems to me that someone at HR doesn't get it.
1247	Yes
1248	Lets talk about all their cases, including the Columbian coal case and the J block case-- Get w/ Twanda and set aside 30 min.
1249	Don't know--maybe both
1250	Sorry about the conference call this morning--- I neglected to get a call in number.
1250	I talked to Paul Simon, who had talked to Limor Nissan, and among the lawyers, we have no more comments.
1250	Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues.
1250	Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions.
1250	If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them.
1250	Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading.
1250	Thanks for your help.
1251	Please handle
1252	I have completely lost track of this case.
1252	I have asked Twanda to set up a call w/ you, me, and our outside counsel.
1252	Now for the 100,000 question----who is our outside counsel?
1252	Let Twanda know.
1253	Looks good
1254	YOU ARE ONE ANAL DUDE
1255	Huh?
1255	For you to handle as you wish.
1256	This is pathetic but I don't know the status of this.
1256	What is going on?
1256	Did we send the letter?
1257	I may be too late on this but here goes---- if arbitration is out then agree to a forum that is not in their backyard.
1258	The issue of the SCE bankruptcy will come up again.
1258	Carl-- did you ever talk to Reliant or Mirant?
1258	The next call that you have re the PG&E bankruptcy, I would like to join in and dicuss the issue of an involuntary filing.
1258	I know we have talked about it before, but because of the hijackers, we never got the full legal analysis.
1258	Tom Laria at White and Case and the McCutchen attys had done some research.
1258	They offered to provide it to us.
1258	Lets take a look, do our own research, and discuss.
1259	what is this/ who is this
1260	This will confirm that I would like to have an organizational meeting at 2 pm central on Tuesday the 18th---one hour.
1260	Twanda will provide a call in #.
1261	By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Twanda to set up a short conf.call w/you on Wed or Thurs to discuss these issues
1262	I am not in a huge hurry.
1262	I just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time.
1262	LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week.
1262	I think LLGM is in a better position than Enron to dictate timing, so I'll leave the scheduling to you.
1263	Thats like saying you want to be a prisoner/inmate to get the free cable.
1264	Sounds like a good plan.
1264	Andrea-- I have asked my asst.
1264	to get with you to reschedule.
1264	M. Haedicke wanted the criminal atty on the call.
1265	I tried to call you, but the phones are out.
1265	No urgency, I just remember your proximity to the WTC and wanted to make sure you and the members of your firm are OK.
1266	I am ok
1267	As you will recall, Steve was referred to us by Neal Manne and served as local counsel in the Glatzer matter.
1267	He has done a great job.
1267	Although I don't have anything now, I would love to send something his way.
1268	Please handle
1269	I just talked to our accounting dept and told them about your proposal to fix the mistake.
1269	They are ok with it.
1269	Just make sure you document it as described in this e-mail.
1269	P.S.
1269	There is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill.
1269	This must be the kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in Sacramento.
1270	FYI
1271	Thanks.
1271	I'll take the third week of February.
1271	By the way-- if you call the house during that week and someone tells you they rented it from me for $5000 per day, that's my brother and no matter what he says, that's only an inside joke in our family.
1272	Sounds good
1273	All joking aside, we would love to use it.
1273	Maybe next summer.
1273	By the way, although I have not invited you and Dave to come to Portland on the 3rd, you are welcome.
1273	I am not sure it is the best use of your time.
1273	I am flying to SF to meet w/ Gary on the day of the 3rd to catch up on FERC issues You may want to come to that.
1274	In your firm's name
1275	I would have David interface with the Costilla D&O insurer.
1275	I would call Jim Studdert re Enron coverage.
1276	Yes-- deal with Willie directly.
1276	As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine.
1276	Is that just ENA or does EES also have a claim?
1277	Twanda will call you
1278	I am flying in on the morning of the 3rd, arriving at approx.
1278	9:30.
1278	I will be leaving for Portland at 5:30.
1278	That should give us from 10:30 to 3:30.
1279	You have this on my calender for the 27th of September.
1280	Jim Derrick sent me your message to him about this lawsuit.
1280	Thanks for your intrerest.
1280	We have already retained V&E to represent us.
1281	Thanks.
1281	I am a mean 30 handicap.
1282	I would like to talk to your partner.
1282	Can you give me the info.
1283	I have to move some stuff around on the 8th.
1283	Is that set in stone?
1284	George-- are you ok for the 8yh?

1285	Congrats.
1286	Not only have I seen it, I have also taken credit for it.
1287	Can you go to lunch w/ Ileana Blanco and me on Thursday?
1288	Andy Edison is handling and he will respond.
1289	You have it in hand--as I knew you would.
1289	Adkin's atty is supposed to call me at 9:30.
1289	you may want to call him today to let him know not to call me.
1290	Randy Pais at Enron is handling.
1290	You are right that all of this is confidential.
1290	I don't think we want anyone to know that we are asking for a permit and the selling the site.
1290	By the way, we have no buyer.Randy has your name if he needs anyone in Memphis.
1290	Nice to hear from you.
1291	I have asked Twanda to set up a short call.
1292	yes
1293	Knox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2.
1293	What business person, if any, should we talk to about this?
1293	With Carrin, Neal M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again.
1294	I am willing to allow our name as a cc.
1294	Let me know and I will call her back.
1295	You pick for me

1328	Did you find any empty hotels?
1329	Thanks.

1338	Gail-- please coordinate.
1339	This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am.
1339	Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting.
1339	We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun.
1339	I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts.
1339	We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units.
1339	The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
1339	The Sun meeting will include the commercial team.
1339	An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.
1340	The meeting is in 3321.
1341	Did this get paid?
1341	If not, we need to process asap.
1342	Tell Bethany that I am sorry I miss the Country Day Alumni function last Fri.
1342	I told her I would be there, but other more pressing matters prevailed----at least I think so--- the days are blurring together.
1342	I probably did one of two things--- got drunk( there has been alot of that around here lately), or went home, got in bed, and pulled the covers up over my head.
1343	The good news is that the 4th beer usually makes the pain/depression/anger go away.
1343	The bad news is that last week it was the 3rd beer.
1344	I am not sure why you want to go, but of course you can.
1344	Just show up.
1345	Have we implemented a policy?
1346	Robert Williams

1347	He will handle.
1348	I will not be able to make it
1349	The Horror, the Horror
1350	As you will note from the papers, we are in deep shit.
1350	As you would guess, Haedicke is in charge.Call him.
1351	The press is bad because it is accurate.
1351	I have never seen more greed, arrogance, and lack of morality.
1352	Set up a meeting
1353	If we go to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, we probably can't meet you.
1353	Julie is waivering on Las Vegas though.
1353	I'll call.
1354	No, we don't care.
1355	Bonnie White can help you.
1356	I can't see how this could be related to our battles with the AG over trading issues in CA.
1356	I have no concerns.
1357	I am going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, but am available any day but Monday next week.
1357	Let me know your schedule.
1358	Good.

1360	Two issues: First,should we pay the law firms?
1360	Total is 43mm.

1360	Can we have a 10-15min telephone call at 4:45 or after the Board meeting (6:00)
1361	How about we give her some Enron stock options.
1362	If you get this, drop what you are doing and give me a call at the office.
1363	I can't begin to tell you how much I would like to do that---except for one thing.

0	Our legal is reviewing right now.
0	Hopefully, I'll have a final answer tomorrow.

1	Stevens- The contract was mailed to Molly yesterday(9/11/00).
1	Let me know if she doesn't get it by tomorrow.
1	Thanks, Susan
2	Stevens- I just spoke to Stacy Dickson and she confirmed that the contract was mailed out a week ago.
2	She will e-mail it to Molly and mail it again regular mail.
2	Sorry for the delay.
2	Susan
3	Just checking to make sure Molly got the contract yesterday via email.
3	Let me know if she didn't.
3	Thanks Susan Pereira
4	Thanks for the update.
4	Susan
5	Stevens- I've called Stacy Dickson and provided the term changes for the confirmation.
5	Thanks, Susan
6	The IF term should be Nov.1, 2000 - Feb. 28, 2001.
6	Sorry if I messed up on the phone.
6	Thanks, Susan
7	Looks good, Stacy.
7	Thanks for your help.
7	Susan
8	It may be time for a drink!!
8	Susan
9	Leslie- I was wanting to know what the imbalances are booked at.
9	Are they all mark-to-marketed or valued at some historical pricing?
9	Also, can you work with LIG on the paperwork for settling the imbalance?
9	Thanks, Susan
10	Nelson probably has most of the deals.
10	Here are mine for October with the sitara numbers- Superior - Mobile Bay - 413984,413992 Vintage - Koch- no Oct deal but Sept deal was 380360 Santa Fe/Snyder - Stingray Superior - Sea Robin - 227768
11	Leslie- We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way: We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
11	which equals $58,035.79.
11	The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.
11	Let me know if you have any questions.
11	I negotiated this with Scott Garrison at Koch.
11	Thanks, Susan Pereira
12	Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at $1.77/mmbtu.
12	Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 to clear this imbalance.
12	Thanks, Susan Pereira p.s.- you can just address the letter to Daniel Kieran
13	Is this a receivable for LRC or Enron?
14	If the receivable is for ENA, it will have to be settled separately.
14	Andy Ring talks to Koch for day trading.
14	Maybe she could pursue this.
14	Susan Pereira
15	Stevens- Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.
15	They are waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract.
15	That should happen some time next week.
15	We will send you those numbers and the prices once we receive the final allocation.
15	Thanks, Susan Pereira
16	The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.
16	I asked you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its precursors.
16	You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the deal.
16	Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu??
16	Susan Pereira
17	Thanks
18	We'll take the lesson on the 25th at 11 am.
18	Thanks, Susan Pereira
19	Helen- What is the mailing address?
19	Susan Pereira
20	We have not received any final allocation from Destin.
20	I'm not sure what the holdup is.
20	I think Joe talked with Harvey at Rebel and communicated this to him today.
20	Susan
21	Here are the Gas Daily prices for Sonat on the days of allocated flow: Let me know if you need any more info.
21	Susan
22	Good questions!
22	The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would need to be deducted.
22	Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.
22	As for the prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu transportation.
22	Let me know if you have any more questions.
22	Susan
23	Stevens- I haven't heard back from our accounting group on what their fax number is.
23	In the meantime, you can just fax the invoice to me at 713-646-8453.
23	Susan
24	We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.
24	El Paso insists on being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the imbalance occurred.
24	We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.
24	Maybe we'll pay it back next year.
24	Thanks, Susan Pereira P.S.- Was new paperwork sent out to Cinergy??
25	We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.
25	I think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC postings for the three pipes plus a penny.
25	Those prices are as follows: Transco Zone 3 $4.51 Florida Zone 3 $4.45 The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted from this price.
25	I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
25	Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.
25	ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices!).
25	Thanks, Susan Pereira
26	Jane- I've corrected the transport and fuel deducts in sitara and e-mailed the EOTT folks.
26	Thanks Susan
27	Stevens- I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.
27	The transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.
27	This should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation contract.
27	The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes at the receipt point into Destin.
27	If you bill us on gross volumes, then you must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in transportation costs from the pipeline.
27	From my calculations, deducts from gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec. Please let me know if you have any questions.
27	Thanks Susan Pereira
28	My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.
28	The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel.
28	The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel.
28	Please let me know if this is not your understanding.
28	Also, please keep in mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this production.
28	Thanks, Susan Pereira
29	Whoops!
29	I goofed.
29	The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel value) is $.2602.
29	The transport deduct on net volumes is $.2422.
29	Sorry for the confusion.
29	Susan
30	Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement payments from Koch and LIG?
30	Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?
30	I have a statement from El Paso showing this volume.
30	They want us to sign and return the volume statement.
30	Thanks, Susan Pereira
31	Leslie- Have you sent any confirmation to El Paso stating our agreement with the imbalance and that it has been transferred to ENA?
31	Susan
32	Helen- Is a stand-by time available for Sunday afternoon around 2 pm?
32	The lesson would be for my daughter Kali.
32	Thanks, Susan Pereira
33	Helen- Kali will be there at 2 pm Sunday the 14th for a private lesson.
33	Thanks, Susan Pereira
34	Helen- Would a private lesson be available on Saturday or Sunday at 4 pm?
34	Thanks, Susan Pereira
35	We'll be there at 4 pm on Sunday.
35	Thanks Susan Pereira
36	Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car trouble.
36	By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.
36	That would allow for 3 additional private lessons.
36	What days and times will work over the next few weeks?
36	Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.
36	After school during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.
36	Thanks, Susan Pereira
37	At the Enron camp, how are the age groups combined?
37	For example, are 5-7 year olds together, 8-10 year olds, etc....?
37	Thanks, Susan Pereira
38	Ruth- I've been trying to call you back since last night, but your line is always busy.
38	I'd be happy to drive on Saturday.
38	Shall I call everyone?
38	Other than Jazz and Kali, I'll need to pick up Francie, Angela and Amy, right?
38	Any more?
38	Thanks, Susan
39	Thanks for keeping up with that, Chris.
39	Susan
40	I am resending this, as I have not received any reply.
40	Susan Pereira
41	Sunday at 3 pm will work.
41	Thanks, Susan Pereira
42	I can be there.
42	Susan
43	Either day will work for me.
43	Susan Pereira
44	The three indices are 9.81,9.89 and 9.97; the average is $9.89.
44	So, the contract price is $9.89 + .01 less .2422 transport on the net of fuel volumes.
44	If you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value of the fuel (0.3%).
44	Thanks, Susan Pereira
45	I don't have any issues.
45	Thanks, Susan Enron North America Corp.
46	Dave- There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like to see on the website and stack manager.
46	I realize that there may be bigger issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??
46	For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack manager.
46	Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the website, so people could shade products different colors.
46	This might cut down on trades made in error.
46	Thanks, Susan Pereira
47	Kathy- Thursdays at 6:30 will generally work for us; however, on Thursday the 15th we unfortunately have a conflict.
47	Can you send me the list of girls who are on the team?
47	I know Kali is curious whether she knows anyone or not.
47	Thanks, Susan
48	Helen- Just checking on whether there will be a lesson time available on Sunday afternoon.
48	Saturday late afternoon might work for us as well.
48	Thanks, Susan Pereira (Kali Pereira)
49	Thanks Susan Pereira
50	Paul- Please take me off your email list for University of Chicago candidates.
50	I have not been involved in any recruiting efforts.
50	Thanks, Susan Pereira
51	Thanks for your help.
51	Susan
52	Hi, Jan!
52	I hope you are all doing well.
52	I'm sorry to hear that your mother is ill.
52	I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.
52	I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check with you about our visiting this summer.
52	We were thinking about the second week in July.
52	We have not made any definitive plans.
52	Let me know if that will work.
52	If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...
52	Take care.
52	Susan
53	Helen- I was just checking to see if Sunday, Feb. 18 at 3 pm would work for Kali's last private lesson.
53	Thanks, Susan Pereira
54	I am not available for any recruiting at this time.\ Susan Pereira
55	Helen- Since we last emailed, something has come up on Sunday afternoon.
55	Would it be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?
55	Or, Kali has Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day.
55	Thanks, Susan Pereira
56	We'll plan to come to the camp.
56	Thanks, Susan Pereira
57	Helen- I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?
57	How many kids are in the class and who is the instructor?
57	Also, are there any group lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?
57	Are the classes large?
57	Thanks, Susan Pereira
58	My location is EB 3223F.
58	Susan Pereira
59	Rob- From now on, I think Nelson Ferries (w/Enron) will be handling all our short term wellhead purchases.
59	He may have talked to you already.
59	His number is 713-853-3061.
59	Thanks.
59	Susan Pereira
60	I would like to cancel my registration for this class.
60	Thanks, Susan Pereira
61	Hi, Elise.
61	Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in transit!!).
61	We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.
61	So that we can get the thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali a Skipper doll or a bath set in a blue bag?
61	Thanks for your help.
61	Susan P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.
62	Thanks.
62	I had a feeling Laura's gift was the bath bag.
62	As for the $20 donation, I'm glad we got it, because we ended up short on the cash collected for the cookies.
62	Susan
63	Stevens, Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.
63	Once we talk to the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.
63	I'll let you know as soon as I know...
63	Susan
64	Kathy- Is soccer practice on for tonight?
64	It looks like it might be raining then.
64	Also, for the game on Sunday, what time do you want everyone to be there?
64	Thanks Susan Pereira
65	Margaret- I'll get the cookies on Friday.
65	Can you pick them up Friday night or Saturday?
65	I'll need payment for the 6 boxes then, as well as your money for the first order.
65	Thanks, Susan
66	Thanks for the birthday card.
66	I had a fairly quiet birthday.
66	I went to work that day and went out to dinner that night.
66	Hope you are all doing well.
66	We're all fine, but very busy!!!
66	Take care, Susan
67	I need 2 cases of Thin Mints and 6 packages of Shortbread.
67	I'm planning to go to the reorder station Friday afternoon unless someone has extras.
67	Thanks, Susan Pereira
68	Kathy- Is it safe to assume that practice is cancelled for tonight??
68	Susan Pereira
69	Margaret- Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's class booth--all at different times.
69	I don't think we'll be able to help all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than happy to help Mary out.
69	Susan Pereira
70	Hi, Jan!
70	I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back in business (my words, not hers!).
70	I asked the kids about going ahead to Brazil with y'all.
70	Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.
70	When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.
70	We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.
70	We're going to use OnePass miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early April to get seats.
70	Talk to you soon.
70	Susan P.S.- Happy Birthday early!!
71	Stevens- We've moved up the food chain at Destin, but have not received a response yet.
71	I'll be out next week.
71	Check with Joe Casas to see if he hears anything Susan
72	Julie- I left my paperwork in the green box at your doorstep yesterday.
72	I wanted to make sure you received it.
72	I'll be out of town until March 25, so if you have any questions, I won't be able to respond until then.
72	Thanks, Susan Pereira
73	Please take me off your mailing list!!
74	Thanks.
74	I did not do a T5.
74	Susan Pereira
75	I sent in a check for $200 for deposits for my daughter and son.
75	They are both going for two weeks.
75	I thought the deposit was $50/wk per child.
75	Susan Pereira PM
76	In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.
76	He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.
76	Susan Enron North America Corp.
77	David- I just got back in town.
77	Monday the 2nd will work for me.
77	Susan
78	Hi, Jan. I hope you are all doing well.
78	Maman has updated us on your mother's condition.
78	I know it must be stressful, especially from long distance.
78	Kali liked her birthday gifts.
78	Believe it or not, we didn't already have the World Pup movie.
78	We had rented it back in February and the kids liked it.
78	I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was wondering what your travel schedule was in June.
78	When will you be arriving, when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling without us on the plane), etc. The earliest we could leave for Brazil would be the evening of Friday, July 6.
78	We would probably need to return to Houston by July 14.
78	Let me know how that sounds.
78	Also, if we need to reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, let me know.
78	That's certainly more important.
78	Talk to you soon.....
78	Susan
79	I would like to have a spot in the new garage.
79	Susan W. Pereira
80	Ok, here's the plan.....
80	Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed.
80	the 27th on the evening flight (?).
80	Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we can make the reservations.
80	We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later I guess.
80	Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, arriving Saturday morning.
80	The four of us will return to Houston on the next Fri.
80	night flight (13th).
80	I think we've decided not to go to Foz do Iguacu, since we have so little time.
80	Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a few days.
80	Can we all go together and drive.
80	Maybe you could get hotel reservations there?
80	Let me know what you think.
80	We're excited about the trip.
80	The kids can't wait.
80	Susan
81	David- Is the meeting on for April 2?
81	Susan
82	Kathy- I got your message.
82	Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going away party for a friend.
82	She'll be there on this Thursday.
82	Do you have a uniform for her?
82	Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt and has that for the next game.
82	I'll try to work on her.
82	Thanks, Susan Pereira
83	Thanks.
83	See you on Thursday.
83	Susan
84	Jan- I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.
84	The tourism website is down.
84	It looks like a great place.
84	I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, he might miss out on working out for one day).
84	I think the kids might like it too.
84	Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?
84	I asked my boss about it.
84	He went with his family when he was living in Argentina.
84	They really enjoyed it.
84	Can you go ahead and check on flights and which hotel to stay at?
84	The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the nicer one on the internet.
84	I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking them there.
84	Is that right?
84	Let me know the airline and I'll check here.
84	I guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.
84	Also, would y'all want to go as well?
84	Thanks for your help.
84	Susan
85	Tomorrow at 1:45 would work better.
85	Wednesday is AGA storage day and it's hard for me to get away before3pm.
85	Thanks, Susan
86	Thanks.
86	Susan P.S.-Did you get my other email?
87	Sorry.
87	You probably sent it to my home email...
87	Susan
88	Jan- I was looking at the wrong week.
88	Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my only excuses.
88	How much time should we spend in Rio?
88	Should we leave for Foz on the 11th?
88	I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.
88	That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.
88	I'll work on Renato when he gets back in town.
88	Thanks, Susan
89	Thanks for your help, Jan. Renato just got home late last night.
89	I'll have to inform him of our travel plans!!
89	Talk to you soon.
89	Susan
90	Dear Mr. Junek- Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES offshore firm contract is now on your book.
90	Scott thinks that it is volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.
90	The wellhead desk will take this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.
90	Sincerely yours, Susan (aka "the bitch")
91	We returned the printer we had ordered through Click-at-Home.
91	We did not reorder another printer through ClickatHome.
91	Susan Pereira
92	We ordered a computer, printer, scanner, etc. We just returned the printer.
92	Susan Pereira
93	Kathy- Our home email address has changed: Thanks, Susan Pereira
94	Same transport & fuel deductions.
94	As for the BTU issue, Joe has talked with the Destin people several times about it.
94	They said they were going to get with Kahuna and straighten things out.
94	Joe will call again today.
94	Sorry about the delay, but we really have no control over it.
94	Susan
95	the ticket is 704011 Susan
96	I can meet anytime after 11:00 am tomorrow, between 11 and 12 on Wednesday, anytime after 11 on Thursday, and after lunch on Friday.
96	Thanks, Susan Pereira
97	Ruth- I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.
97	I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.
97	Hopefully, we'll have that info the first week in May.
97	Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.
97	I think Anna Edelman is also interested.
97	I left a message with Sue today letting her know that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm doesn't work.
97	Thanks, Susan
98	David- If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to funnel it through you?
98	If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on P&Z issues.
98	We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.
98	I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 12-2.
98	Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on election day, May 5.
98	I could do that anytime before 4 pm.
98	Anyone else interested???
98	Thanks, Susan Pereira
99	Have you been drinking, Kimberly??
100	Just kidding with you.
100	Hope your hand is getting better.
100	See you on Monday.
100	Susan
101	Julie- Is there any chance that the recognitions will be available prior to May 9?
101	Our troop is having its last meeting before the summer on the afternoon of May 9.
101	Let me know if I can help.
101	Thanks, Susan Pereira
102	Roy Anne- Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?
102	We have early dismissal that day.
102	The recognitions for the cookie sale may not be available until the evening of the 9th.
102	I've emailed the coordinator to see if we can get them earlier.
102	Thanks, Susan
103	Jan- Looks good.
103	I'll finalize with Renato when he gets back in town tomorrow.
103	We'll email you then.
103	Thanks for all your help.
103	Susan
104	Thanks.
104	Just let me know when you want me to come over.
104	Susan Pereira
105	Thanks for your help.
105	It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little more exotic than ours.
105	Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the girls' backyards.
105	The girls had a lot of fun.
105	I was lucky and didn't have to volunteer.
105	Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the attention.
105	He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!
105	Talk to you soon.
105	Susan
106	That sounds great!!
106	We're looking forward to the trip as well.
106	The kids are anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.
106	I don't know if there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.
106	Mayba a movie or two.
106	By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.
106	If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.
106	Alexia will especially enjoy it.
106	See you soon.
106	Love, Susan
107	Cindy- The T-shirt people will deliver the shirts around 4 pm on Thursday.
107	See you then.
107	Hope your son is ok.
107	Susan Pereira
108	Thanks, Victor.
108	Susan
109	Kathy- Thanks for the email.
109	Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a schedule conflict that I had.
109	Plus, she will not go to the last game because her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.
109	I had her skip another friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those games!!).
109	If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.
109	She really was never much of a team participant.
109	I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall will be like last fall and not this spring.
109	Thanks for all your help, time and effort.

116	I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to forward my email address to her.
116	If I don't hear back from you today, I will probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.
116	Maybe I can clarify a few issues with her.
116	As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.
116	In the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.

129	Mayor Lewis- I would like to recommend strongly that the City of West University postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.
129	At least 50-60 girls (ages 6-8) in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park from February through May each year.
129	What harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season?
129	If the field is unavailable in 2002, it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice, especially near West U. West U is all about family and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?
129	Sincerely, Susan Pereira
130	Thanks for your support!
130	Susan Pereira
131	Dear Mr. May- I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.
131	Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.
131	WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U. What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?
131	West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.
131	What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??
131	Sincerely, Susan Pereira
132	Thanks, Kam Susan

134	Valerie- Go with Vintage's numbers on the spreadsheet.
134	I have corrected the sitara ticket.
134	I think the problem might have been that I forgot to adjust the fuel value from the previous month.
134	Sorry for the mistake.
134	Thanks, Susan Pereira
135	Hi, fellow P&Z members.
135	I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with Dan Muniza of Center America.
135	Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property (where Weiner's is now).
135	Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement along Braes for a patio area.
135	Currently, that area is being used for parking.
135	The proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.
135	Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts Eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick.
135	They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc. David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potential liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.
135	Also, there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street.
135	I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.
135	David did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway.
135	As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elevations from Eckerd's yet.
135	He's expecting to get something this week.
135	He's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center.
135	Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the additional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.
135	Dan Muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone.
135	They prefer that it be available for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide open after 5 pm.
135	David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.
135	He wanted to do that prior to Comp.
135	Plan meeting on the 30th.
135	Thanks, Susan Pereira
136	David- After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.
136	Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.
136	If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.
136	Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.
136	Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.
136	Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.
136	Thanks, Susan
137	Terry- I can drive my Sequoia to practice and take 6 girls to Baskin Robbins as well.
137	Between you and me, that should be enough space for all the girls.
137	Susan
138	no
139	I've forwarded your message to Christina Sanchez.
139	She was the one who reallocated the volumes.
139	She will look at it again.
139	Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
139	Thanks, Susan
140	Hi, Connie!!
140	Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.
140	Things got busy.
140	The stock is still going down, but not as much.
140	It's at $13.92 right now, yippee!!!
140	I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.
140	I guess I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get back to $45 or $50 until then.
140	There aren't any new businesses for Enron to get into to make the stock analysts excited.
140	All the money we're making in trading is apparently not doing it for them.
140	Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?
140	It might be hard to get a concrete case against them.
140	I'm sure some of them are in the same boat as the rest of us.
140	Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think Wall Street wants Ken Lay's head on a platter.
140	I'm sure the stock analysts are really frustrated that Jeff Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would have gutted him.
140	Old Skilling is just grinning in his new River Oaks mansion.
140	I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.
140	I think I should sign up for anger management classes.
140	As for my car purchase....
140	yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Sequoia.
140	I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balance.
140	Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's position was superfluous.
140	This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Entergy-Koch trading merger.
140	They put him in between Renato and his former boss, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.
140	Entergy-Koch is so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.
140	The guys working for Renato are sick about it.
140	The upper management at Entergy-Koch has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process that the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality.
140	Of course, now, Renato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never consider going back.
140	They are paying him through the end of the year and vesting him in all the savings plans.
140	They are also paying him a year's salary, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.
140	He's been actively looking for a new job.
140	Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be working until I'm 70!!
140	Oh, well.
140	Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....
140	Susan
141	I've left a message with my contact at Vintage.
141	I haven't heard back yet.
141	I do know that in Oct and Nov the gath.
141	fee is .0981.
141	I'll let you know when I find out about Sept. Thanks, Susan
142	Rudy- Yes, I agree to the cancellation of deal 44551573556.
142	Thanks, Susan Pereira
143	This just in ....
143	ENE at $11.31.....Good thing my guns are locked up!!
143	Susan
144	Valerie- I just found out from Robert Eubank at Vintage that he was telling me the wrong thing for the gathering charges.
144	SLN 9205 has always had a .0981 gathering fee.
144	SLN 2883 gath.
144	charges are as follows: Sept. .0268, Oct .0628, Nov .0628.
144	I'll adjust the sitara tickets, but I'll have to weight average the gathering.
144	You'll need to fine tune it since you're dealing with the actual volumes from each wellhead point.
144	Thanks, Susan
145	Thanks a lot, Karen!!
145	UGH!!!
146	No kidding!!!
146	I'll be afraid to look at my third quarter savings plan statement when it comes next month.
146	Each time I lose a digit on the total!!
146	I was thinking about retiring next year--HA HA.
146	It looks like retirement has been delayed indefinitely.....
146	Talk to you later Susan
147	Valerie- With the gathering charge corrections, do we have any other outstanding issues with Vintage?
147	Susan
148	Laurie- Christina was going to review the allocation and change if needed last week.
148	Are we square with Superior now???
148	Susan
149	Sorry for the confusion.
149	Thanks for your help.
149	Susan
150	Nope, no relation.
150	We're only related to poor Pereiras!!
150	Susan
151	Valerie- Are we ok with Vintage now?
151	Susan
152	My husband is no longer with Koch, but we do live in Southside.
152	We moved to Southside when it was the same price as West U. We're definitely some of the poorer folks in Southside now......
153	You didn't offend me at all.
153	I wish I were related to someone on the Board of Directors...
154	Is the Koch/Sabine interconnect already mapped to Sabine??
154	Susan
155	Yes, I will be there.
155	Is the trainer supposed to come tonight??
155	Susan
156	Laurie- No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.
156	I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term of the existing sitara ticket.
156	I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.
156	You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.
156	Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.
156	The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.
156	Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??
156	Thanks, Susan Pereira
157	We support you 100%, Chris!!
158	Thanks, Laurie.
158	Susan
159	Stevens- I don't think anything has changed.
159	The transport rate is $.2421 + 0.3% fuel.
159	The pricing is the average + $.01.
159	I've emailed Tricia to see what the problem is.
159	Susan
160	I think we've got the prices right in our system now.
160	Susan
161	Let me know if your payment doesn't look right.
161	Susan
162	Thanks, Stephanie
163	Mr. Lay- After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.
163	Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrencI have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.
163	I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.
163	As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.
163	I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).
163	I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.
163	Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).
163	We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....
163	We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.
163	Things were great, weren't they?
163	Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."
163	He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.
163	He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year.
163	Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.
163	In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.
163	I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.
163	I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.
163	Many others are not that fortunate.
163	So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.
163	They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.
163	And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.
163	Now even that is essentially gone.
163	Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.
163	The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.
163	It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.
163	The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.
163	There should be an accounting for this behavior.
163	You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.
163	Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

164	Kimberly- I would like a loaner laptop for the weekend.
164	Is that possible??
164	Also, the ice machine by us is not dispensing ice anymore.
164	Thanks, Susan P.S.- I promise not to complain about anything next time I write......
165	Why are we at the 110% and not something less?
165	When is the 30 day period over?
165	Susan
166	Still here, but don't know for how long...
166	I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.
166	Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.
166	I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.
166	We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.
166	I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....
166	Oh, well.
166	We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.
166	Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.
166	We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.
166	Hope everything is going well for you.
166	How is your house coming along??
166	Send me a note back.
166	I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.
166	They start laying off people next week.
166	It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.
166	Merry Christmas!!
166	Take care, Susan
167	I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.
167	I really appreciate it.
167	I had a lot of fun working with the girls.
167	They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.
167	It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.
167	The girls have a lot to be proud of.
167	I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.
167	Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.
167	Have a great holiday season.
167	Take care, Susan Pereira P.S.
167	- Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?
167	I don't have their email address.
167	Thanks.
168	I tried to send this to your home email, but it was undeliverable.
169	Hi, Connie!
169	The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.
169	We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.
169	I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.
169	They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.
169	I don't know who has been notified.
169	We may all be walking out the door soon.
169	As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.
169	I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!
169	We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.
169	Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.
169	Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.
169	They haven't written their lists yet, though.
169	We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.
169	The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.
169	I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.
169	It looks pretty bleak.
169	Talk to you soon.
169	Susan
170	I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.
170	We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.
170	There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.
170	If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.
170	There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.
170	I guess those will happen.
170	I don't know.
170	They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.
170	Stay tuned....
171	Craig- You might want to talk to Ormet concerning deliveries for December.
171	It is very likely we may have to default to them for December.
171	We have NYMEX length and may be able to use some hub gas to transport to Ormet.
171	I don't know which deals will be served first.
171	Susan Pereira
172	That's fine, Stevens.
173	Sounds like a great idea, Ana.
173	Thanks, Susan Pereira
174	Please discontinue my United Way contributions for 2001 and 2002.
174	Thanks, Susan Pereira
175	currently, it is pereira@houston.rr.com
176	Good testimonial!
176	I hope they print it.
177	Guess what?
177	I got a response from Ken on my email to him.
177	In fact, he responded just a few days after I wrote him, but his assistant didn't send it back to me until today.
177	He hand wrote a response on the printout of my email.
177	Susan
178	You're the best!
179	Ana- I think I am signed up as an alternate for the field trip on Thursday.
179	Do you know if I'll be needed?
179	Thanks, Susan Pereira

7	Ray, Teb is right..
7	Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices on June 1 instead of May 31.
7	At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.
7	This would be after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively capture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.
7	Hope I have not confused the issue for you.
7	If you have any other questions, please let me know Thanks.

25	Gary is right.
25	But if NGTS is the only contract, they will take the swing.
25	Or is Pioneer saying they want to take the swing?
25	If Pioneer wants to do the swing, maybe they could do a contract to cover the swing volume only?
25	Karen and Larry, what do you think?
25	Thanks.
25	Lynn
26	Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the morning meeting: The report is completed for all information except: Storage Operational Capacity Current and Accum Imbalances The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.
26	The above referenced fields have been a challenge to get the data base populated as needed.
26	But this group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not giving up on possibilities.
26	As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.
26	Storage will change once the new report is completed.
26	Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to ensure we get the product we need.

26	Thanks.

111	An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.
111	Several questions have come up over the weekend.
111	The weekend crew is documenting the questions.
111	I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on Monday.
111	Then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made.
111	One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.
111	ie, if we are allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.
111	If we are allocating withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.
111	Mike Bodnar will pursue this enhancement further.
111	Thanks.
111	Lynn
112	Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report and the automation of the storage report.

143	Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you.
143	On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.
143	Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.
143	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?
143	We certainly would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side.
143	This is especially important for new meters as we go through the billing process.
143	Just a thought.
143	Thanks.
143	Lynn
144	It's a surprise!!!!!!!!!!!
144	- We had a choice of 2 different sizes and Ava is checking on some info for us.
144	Thanks.
144	lynn
145	Mike, thank you for the update.
145	My only concern now is the file Jeff sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
145	I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed this weekend.
145	Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available this weekend to help test.

214	Kent and Dave, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting.
214	High level recap is: 130,000 Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day 95,000 Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from the previous day) 140,000 Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF. In looking at LSF, we were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled. It looked to be pretty evenly distributed) 15,000 Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.
214	380,000 The total swing was 419,000.
214	The difference of 39,000 is a combination operational adjustments.
214	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.
214	If you have any questions, please let me know.
214	Thanks.
214	Lynn

228	Thanks.
228	Lynn
229	Shelley, FYI.
229	These are some of the comments and requests we get about people attending the meeting.
229	Normally since Duke is in town and Duke and Robert have an opportunity to meet here, we usually do not sent those reps to the Winter Ops meeting.

229	I'll review the list with you before we make a final decision on who goes.

251	Thanks.
251	Lynn
252	Alfredo, Joe Hartsoe and Shelley Corman have asked Dannis Ballard and myself to work with you on Mr. Formaggio's visit to Enron.

252	We look forward to meeting and visiting with Mr. Fomaggio.

252	If you have any questions, please let Dannis or I know.

252	Lynn
253	Maria, I wanted to follow up after discussions with you and Shelley, the SoCal window is based on what SoCal is willing to confirm into their system for the day.
253	It does not necessarily have anything to do with physical capacity at Needles.

266	I would like to remind everyone it is very critical that we send out accurate invoices to our customers.
266	It is our responsibility to review the reports ahead of time (Measurement, Preliminaries, etc).
266	I feel very strongly that we should NOT be taking comp days on critical accounting days.
266	As I have stated in previous memos this is mainly, reservation close day, the day before commodity close and commodity close day.
266	You should also be considerate of your team when scheduling vacation around these days and ensure you have SPECIFIED proper back up.
266	It is still your responsibility to ensure your invoices are properly reviewed and sent out whether you are in the office or not.
266	If you have any questions, please let me know.
266	Thanks.

305	Thanks.
305	Lynn
306	I am concerned we will have/or should have some of the frank discussions we have with AA setting in the room.
306	Is there anyway we could have a rooster everyone signs to show we attended if that is all they are concerned about?
306	Just a thought.
306	I can live with either decision, but I want to prep my people before the meeting if AA attends.
306	Thanks.
306	Lynn

328	FYI.
329	Shelley, I talked with Kent Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group sends storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes.
329	They do NOT send anything to AGA.
329	But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information from EIA so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers.
329	As a reminder this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up with Kent.
329	If you have any questions, please let me know.
329	Thanks.

357	Lynn
358	We can make the meeting Thursday afternoon if that is better for you guys.
358	It will be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss.
358	Rick, FYI, Shelley postponed her meeting until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting.
358	Possible means they do not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wanted to give us a "heads up" from a system perspective.
358	Hopefully that helps.
358	See ya'll in the morning.
358	Thanks.

363	Please add Theresa on any future emails.
363	Her email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.
363	In talking with Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a cancellation.
363	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting: is the "mis matches" across interconnecting pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.
363	This is still a concern for the Enron pipes and I wold like to know if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.
363	If you would like to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.
363	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.

390	Since we are all moving at different times, we have declared this week to be "causal week" to accomodate cleaning out files, desk, etc. The more we clean out now, the easier it will be to move to our final destination.
390	We appreciate everyone's efforts to accomodate the move as best we can.
390	Please let Donna, Sheila, Rick, Steve, Brad or I know if you have any questions.
390	Thanks.
390	Lynn
391	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs.
391	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.
391	Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team.
391	John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.
391	Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.
391	Thanks.
391	Lynn
392	Fran, here is the draft we worked on today.

392	Lynn
393	John, can you plan on attending?

394	Lynn
395	Terry and Darrell, are you both planning on attending?

412	Please make every effort to contact your customers and let them know they can get into Hottap through URL: If they are having problems accessing Hottap, give them the pertinent information they need to do their "next cycle" business (ie. schedule quantity info).
412	Let's be proactive and help the customers through this frustrating time.
412	I also appreicate everyone staying around until 6:00 last night.
412	It is good to work with a group that is willing to help out where possible.
412	Also, Toby thanks for your "hours" of work on sending out the emails to our customers to let them know what our plans were.
412	Thanks.

422	Lynn
423	Debra, thanks for your reply.
423	Are you comfortable now that you can perform this function instead of Raetta if Jean is gone?
423	Does Jean need to have more specific instructions to cover Transok that specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?
423	Thanks.
423	Lynn
424	Tim and Mike, would it be appropriate to have Mike call Bill and get specifics from him?
424	Then we can do a conference call to explain the cuts?
424	Just a suggestion.
424	Thanks.
424	Lynn
425	Don, this is great.
425	This report was a big hurdle for us.

432	Britt, looks good to me.
432	Thanks.
432	Lynn
433	Britt, to answer #5, Kim Hardman and/or Delaine Kurth may be added to the cc on the letter.
433	The reason I mention Delaine is Jerry Knight (who works for Delaine) is the person that has been calling Robert Benningfield asking for the status of the 12 - 16 adjustment.
433	Thanks.
433	Lynn
434	FYI.
434	Thanks.
434	Lynn
435	Ranelle, John and Michelle, thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question.
435	The question is: How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac) For Nominating purposes: MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ.
435	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.
435	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.
435	EXAMPLE: If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.
435	Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.
435	Anything over will be overrun at IT rate.
435	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.
435	Thanks.
435	Lynn
436	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?
436	Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.
436	Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.
436	Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.
436	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?
436	If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract.
436	If I have confused you, let's discuss.
436	Thanks.
436	Lynn
437	Richard, can you check this out for me.
437	Did the team drop the ball on this one?
437	Thanks.
437	Lynn
438	We need to discuss ASAP this morning.
438	Legale, would you be available at 8:30?
438	We can meet in my office.
438	Gerry, sounds like Legale is who we were looking for.
438	You are welcome to set in, but not necessary.
438	Thanks.
438	Lynn
439	FYI.
439	Are you guys up to speed on this?
439	Thanks.
439	Lynn
440	Robert, is there to be a written resolution plan as you come to agreement?
440	Thanks.
440	Lynn
441	Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.
441	For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning.
441	Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.
441	System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. Saturday morning.
441	On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.
441	Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore most of the gas is staying in the east market.
441	Thanks.
441	Lynn
442	Bob, can you resend this to me.
442	I cannot open the file.
442	Thanks.
442	Lynn
443	John, Ava is gone until tomorrow afternoon.
443	See if Sharon or Alma can help out.
443	Thanks.

445	Ava, please code them as personal time with pay.
445	Thanks.
445	Lynn
446	Ava, I was working 1 - 15th.
446	Thanks.
446	Lynn
447	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.
447	But, you have a responsibility to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if there is alternate deliveries.
447	Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
447	If you have any questions, please let me know.
448	Raetta and Robert, let's talk about some kind of closure on these resolutions.
448	Can we talk tomorrow at 1:30 in my office?
448	Thanks.
448	Lynn
449	It's on my calendar.
449	Thanks.
449	Lynn
450	Ava, please update my calendar.

452	Lynn
453	Mike, let's discuss.
453	Thanks.
453	Lynn
454	Tim, I would like for us to discuss this issue.
454	Normally we do not "settle" on these type of issues.
454	I want to be consistent with how we have treated other shippers when we have found errors in the system.
454	Doesn't mean we can't do a settlement, we just don't want it to back fire on us.
454	Ava, please set up some time on Thursday for Tim, Mike, Bob, Sue and I to visit.
454	Thanks.
454	Lynn
455	Gina, let's do lunch and I'll answer all your questions.

457	Just give me a call.
457	Have a great day with your Mom.
457	Thanks.
457	Lynn
458	Britt, I scheduled a meeting per Drew's request with my team that deals with the Bushton area.
458	Drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful about using the term "PTR calculation" for measurement error adjustments.
458	We thought it would be good for you to attend as well.
458	I want the team to understand how important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about Bushton issues.
458	Hopefully you can attend.
458	Although I think the meeting may be scheduled to 10:00 a.m. instead of 9:30.
458	Hopefully that works for you.
458	Thanks.
458	Lynn
459	John, we look into this for another party at one time?
459	Do you recall what all would be necessary to accomodate this request?
459	Thanks.
459	Lynn
460	Ava has willingly taken on this task.
460	So she will be the point person going forward.
460	Thanks.
460	Lynn
461	Good job in getting this done.
461	How are we coming with the other operators?
461	With us moving forward for Shirley to work from home, emails will be much better than faxes.
461	Thanks.
461	Lynn
462	Gary, thank you for your help.
462	I guess Ricki was having quite a time.
462	Thanks.
462	Lynn

463	Thanks.
463	Lynn
464	Gerry, do you have some time tomorrow, Thursday, that you, Terry, John and I can set down and review what you have a put a "blurb" together to send to the customers.
464	I am open 10:00 to 11:00 or anytime after 2:00.
464	Thanks.
464	Lynn
465	John, I talked with Donna and got back with Bob Burleson.
465	Let's see what his answer is and then I may have you and Donna work on this one.
465	Thanks.
465	Lynn
466	Nancy, good job.
466	Keep up the good work.
466	See if you can get the rest of your team to follow suit with their interconnects.
466	Thanks.

470	Are we going to put this letter in the reservation invoice packet?
470	Also, would we want to post the letter anywhere on the web?
470	Just a thought?
470	Thanks.
470	Lynn
471	Scott, I appreicate your feedback and closure on these items.
471	It helps us to build that confidence that the systems are working correctly instead of being left in "limbo" and coming up with your own conclusions.

480	I know it was the first time most of them had been to a compressor station and they found it very interesting.
480	This was one step in our efforts to help them match the Physical world (Operations) with the Paper world (Nominations, invoices, etc).

484	Thanks.
484	Lynn
485	Brad, just some comments.
485	At the end do we want to say Customer Services Rep instead of Market Service Rep. and should we put the Hottap help desk phone number in that particular Hottap help desk bullitt.

508	Can you check this out.
508	Thanks.
508	Lynn
509	Todd, thank you for the info.
509	I wanted to pass on to you that Sheila Nacey is not going to be able to attend.
509	Could you please replace her name on the Sunday activity with Theresa Hess.
509	Thanks.
509	Again, I look forward to seeing everyon on the 21.

510	Lynn
511	FYI.
511	Thanks.
511	Lynn
512	Teams, it is very important that you attend these meetings before you work the weekend.
512	This will give us an opportunity to ensure everyone has the same understanding of EDI procedures.
512	Mary and Jim, please keep a signed list of who attends training so we can add this to our Training list for 2001.
512	Thanks.
512	Lynn
513	Richard, can you check with marketing to see if they have put the right rate in the system and then coordinate with Bert when he gets back tomorrow.
513	Thanks for your help.
513	Lynn
514	On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable back to January, 1998.
514	In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very many of these issues.
514	Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.
514	My expectation is that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will ask Alice for an update.
514	Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in this effort.
514	All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001.
515	Tracy, keep up the good work.
515	We appreciate you staying on top of Burlington's business.
515	Thanks.
515	Lynn
516	Ava, I am assuming we are sending flowers?
516	You may want to check with Sherry to see if we want to wait until Kathy gets home or send to hospital.
516	Thanks.
516	Lynn
517	Ava, please get Jo and I some dates for giving the Marketers a "Brown Bag" training session on Nomination, Confirmation and Scheduling process.
517	I would like to use the video Room on 42 in Houston and 6th floor in Omaha.
517	I would like to look at the week of October 15th.
517	The session could be a brown bag from 11:30 to 1:00.
517	John Buchanan and I can give the presentation since Terry will be out that week.
517	Thanks.
517	Lynn
518	Ava, please update my calendar with the room number changes.
518	Thanks.
518	Lynn
519	FYI.
519	Thanks.
519	Lynn
520	Donna, attached is a first pass draft of a letter for Shelley to send out to the teams about her up coming staff meeting.
520	I would appreciate your input.
520	You are much better at this than I am.
520	I tend to be to blunt sometimes.
520	Let me know your thoughts.
520	Thanks.
520	Lynn
521	Robert, we have decided to send Donna Scott and a person out of Brad's group to attend this training.
521	Then they will come back and do the training with each of us.
521	This will help minimize costs and yet give us the opportunity for everyone to benefit from the information.
521	Thanks.
521	Lynn
522	Terry, please plan on attending next Wednesday's meeting for the demonstration on the handheld devices.
522	Thanks.
522	Lynn
523	I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meeting yesterday.
523	1.
523	After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.
523	2.
523	Measurement would check to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process.
523	(Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).
523	3.
523	Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS.
523	(We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).
523	4.
523	Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG.
523	5.
523	Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS. After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number. If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen: 1. Measurement should either: a. Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS. b. Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info. 2. If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point. Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic. I would be glad to regroup if you want. I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue. Also Raetta and Jodie are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS. Hopefully it is just a measurement error. We will let you know the outcome. If there is something I missed, please let me know. Thanks. Lynn
524	Joni, we will see if there is enough interest in doing a make-up session, we will certainly be glad to.
524	Thanks.
524	Lynn
525	Deb, yes I need to know who is attending and how many.
525	I will ensure we get you the handouts for Omaha ahead of time.
525	I will also send them to Minneapolis if there are any Marketers attending there as well.
525	Thanks for your help.
525	Lynn
526	Ava, schedule time for you, Terry and I to meet next week and talk about the training and get the handouts ready.
526	Thanks.
526	Lynn
527	FYI.
527	Thanks.
527	Lynn
528	FYI.
528	Thanks.
528	Lynn
529	Ava, please update my email lists.
529	Thanks.
529	Lynn
530	We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.
530	At this time I think the split is OK.
530	I would like for you to put in writing for me the following: Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out.
530	I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team.
530	This may help us address the issue of the two "old" teams merging.
530	For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk.
530	Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.
530	Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator.
530	Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps.
530	GPM Monthly Pricing Report Lamar Power Plant True Ups PVR Report Oneok Gathering Reporting NNG Administrative Contracts SPS Power Plant True Up Conoco Power Plant True Up MOPS Daily Report The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows: Reliant West Texas Gas If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.
530	Thanks.
530	Lynn
531	Randy, did we have problems this weekend?
531	Thanks.
531	Lynn
532	Maggie, Terry and Hasan, I would like to meet with you and Sheila to review both reports before we turn anything off.
532	How about 1:00 Tuesday, October 9th in my office or Sheila's office?
532	Thanks.
532	Lynn
533	FYI.
533	Thanks.
533	Lynn
534	Shelley, on NNG and TW, things were quiet.
534	The SoCal/West of Thoreau spreadsheet is on your desk.
534	Thanks.
534	Lynn
535	Sheila, FYI.
535	I guess she did get a ticket for $153.
535	Thanks.
535	Lynn
536	Ava, I was in the office for October 1 - 15th.
536	Thanks.
536	Lynn
537	Terry, Maggie and Sheila, if you get comfortable with the direction these emails are going, then we do NOT need to meet.
537	Let me know if you feel like we need to group together to finalize this issue and be sure we are on the same page.
537	Otherwise, I would ask that Maggie or Hasan do a final results email and let us know what the outcome is.
537	Thanks for everyone's help on getting this issue behind us.
537	Lynn
538	Shelley, here are the four PAA's for the people who tested the flowing gas.
538	This does not include Larry or Legale.
538	Brad, Rick and I are discussing how to handle these two.
538	The attached PAA's are for Kathy Sturr, Diana Porter, Renee Perry and Jean Adams.
538	If you have any questions, please let me know.
538	Thanks.
538	Lynn
539	The attached was sent to all the attendees at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting.
539	Thought you might be interested in reviewing the summary.
539	If you have any questions, please let me know.
539	Thanks.
539	Lynn (Ext. 3-7637)
540	Lisa, I will not be able to walk, but put me down for $25.00 for you.
540	Thanks.
540	Lynn
541	Thought I would send this to you to approve.
541	Thanks.
541	Lynn
542	Todd, I'll be glad to lead the discussion.
542	Is this informal or do I have to have a formal presentation?
542	Thanks.
542	Lynn
543	Large.
543	Thanks.
543	Lynn
544	Todd, sounds good to me.
544	Iike that better than a formal presentation.
544	Thanks.
544	Lynn
545	Alma, please include Terry Kowalke and Darrell Schoolcraft.
545	Thanks.
545	Lynn
546	Jennifer, how long has this been a problem?
546	Is there a concern we have caused customers problems in nominating due to bad information?
546	Thanks.
546	Lynn
547	Thanks Gerry.
547	I did not pick up on that.
547	Lynn
548	Richard, did this get properly taken care of?
548	Thanks.
548	Lynn
549	Todd, that will be perfect.
549	I think we will have a very good discussion.
549	Thanks.
549	Lynn
550	Shelley, we have established Monday afternoon after Steve Harris' staff meeting to meet and discuss: 1.
550	TW Shipper Imbalance Status We will stay in the conference room on 13.
550	Just wanted to let you know this is replacing our Tuesday morning meeting which was not working well since everyone moved.
550	Thanks.
550	Lynn
551	Todd, I am planning on attending.
551	Thanks.
551	Lynn Blair
552	Tracy, thanks for staying on top of this.
552	It is my understanding the $6500 is for old Shipper imbalances and cleans up all of Dynegy.
552	Thanks Lynn
553	Ricki, the imbalance meeting will be at 3:30 on Mondays in 1336.
553	Thanks.
553	Lynn
554	Yes, I am available.
554	Thanks.
554	Lynn

555	Thanks.
555	Lynn
556	Sheila, I have you on my calendar for 9:00 Friday.
556	Thanks.
556	Lynn
557	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at "small customer delivery points" on the southend of NNG's system.
557	Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some of yesterday's discussion.
557	These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we would at least throw them on the table.
557	1.
557	If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.
557	It can still be required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is today.
557	2.
557	If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.
557	3.
557	If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes even though they are in the field area?
557	4.
557	Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active) - Could we get Oneok to agree to allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
557	I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.
557	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.
557	Thanks.
557	Lynn
558	We rely on the information from the Process Responsibility meeting to post weekend coverage to the WEB.
558	The coverage is posted by Tuesday morning on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers.
558	Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting.
558	You should have the right information going into Monday's meeting.
558	It does not look good to continually repost this information.
558	If you have any questions, please let me know.
558	Thanks.
558	Lynn
559	Ava, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?
559	Looks like I am going unless cost is ridiculous.
559	Attached is the hotel I would stay in for Wed.
559	night and possibly Thursday night, depending on what you find out with flights.
559	Let me know.
559	Thanks.
559	Lynn

560	Lynn
561	Michelle said the Third Party Storage Tariff sheet is #304.
561	Thanks.
561	Lynn
562	Mike, the other question Michelle had, "Does NNG Contracts have a written procedure for approval of this type of contract? Please check with Linda Trevino. We are to meet with Michelle at 10:30 Friday morning. Thanks. Lynn

565	Thanks.
565	Lynn
566	I think there intent was to be very general.
566	You have the right sheet.
566	Thanks.
566	Lynn
567	Jodie, when you have time let's discuss.
567	Overall I am OK with plan, but had a question about who was monitoring imbalances.
567	Sounds like Marketing is instead of Gas Logistics?
567	Thanks.
567	Lynn
568	So is there nothing for us to do?
568	Thanks.
568	Lynn
569	Shelley, FYI.
569	Thought you might want for Monday's staff meeting Donna, you may want to incorporate some of this in the weekly bullets.

574	FYI.
574	Thanks.
574	Lynn

576	Shelley, wanted to pass this on to you.

604	Thanks.
604	Lynn

605	We better re-group first thing in the morning.
605	Is everyone available at 8:30?
605	Thanks.
605	Lynn
606	I think it would be very prudent to put something on the WEB.
606	We talked about this at the Winter Ops meeting and it would be good to have another reminder.
606	John, would you work with Michelle and Bill to get a posting on the WEB since I will be out of town.
606	Thanks.

612	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.
612	She felt very good about the process but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.
612	We can discuss when I get back next week.
612	Thanks.
612	Lynn
613	Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.
613	Sheila, your name is on the list.
613	Are you getting phone messages?
613	She also cleaned up some old names on the list and added the new people.
613	Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on this list?
613	Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?
613	Thanks.
613	Lynn
614	FYI.
614	Thanks.
614	Lynn
615	Here is a first pass at the customer letter.

694	Lynn
695	Shelley, do you still want the report Terry is doing each Monday for the TW SOCAL and West of Throeau numbers.
695	We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations so we could track any possible "holes" in the pipe.
695	So far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report unless you need it for Stan's meeting?
695	Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes.
695	Thanks.
695	Lynn
696	FYI.
696	Thanks.

700	Brad, I do not see any overlap.
700	Looks good to me.
700	Thanks.
700	Lynn
701	Just to clarify Britt's comments.
701	Harry is using NNG's numbers for total imbalance.
701	To split the imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok's allocation of actual volumes.
701	The variance between Oneok and NNG will go to the Oneok imbalance to tie to NNG's ultra sonic measurement.
701	Thanks.
701	Lynn
702	Shelley, I would appreciate any comments or feedback on the attached.
702	I am trying to formulate my thoughts to be positive and get our message across.
702	Donna helped me put some info together.
702	Now I need your thoughts.
702	Thanks.
702	Lynn
703	Wednesday has a lot of meetings for Gas Logistics.
703	How about Tuesday, November 13 at 1:00 p.m.?

704	Lynn

705	Lynn
706	John, FYI.
706	If you can attend that would be great.
706	Thanks.
706	Lynn
707	Gary, any comments you want to add?
707	Thanks.
707	Lynn
708	Attached is the spreadsheet Raetta put together after receiving all of the billing information to review the parties involved in the 3.0 bcf long to the pipe position on NNG for October, 2001.
708	If you have any questions, let Raetta or I know.
708	Sue, the Pinnacle Natural Gas imbalance is the 5,000/day balancing Pinnacle is allowed before volumes go to park and ride.
708	Thanks.
708	Lynn
709	OK, after talking with Gerry, here is my second try at answering Greg's question trying not to get to detailed.
709	What do you think?
710	Jo, I apologize.
710	Your right.
710	The imbalances are short to the pipe.
710	To be sure we are all on the same page.
710	All the deliveries off of NNG on this report took more gas than scheduled and the receipts gave us less than scheduled.
710	Thanks.
710	Lynn
711	Greg, I answered your questions in blue.
711	Please let me know if you need more clarification.
711	Thanks.
711	Lynn
712	Really a short position not long.
713	Cara, I hope you surgery goes well.
713	Very good memo on keeping the team and management informed.
713	Keep up the good work.
713	Thanks.
713	Lynn
714	Ava, let's discuss changes I need for my presentation tomorrow.
714	Thanks.
714	Lynn
715	Harry, have you seen this?
715	Are you familiar with the info?
715	I have a meeting at 3:00 with Dan Fancler, Tracy and Steve Weller on the EPPI issues.
715	Just wondered if you have any detail on this attachment I need to understand?
715	Thanks.
715	Lynn
716	Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?
716	I had a question from Alliant, "You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation, why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR? Wouldn't that help the system?"
716	I think it would be hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all at the same time.
716	What do you guys think?
716	Thanks.
716	Lynn
717	Frank, where are we on the review you were heading up after our conference call with Dave and Measurement?
717	Looks like more and more customers are questioning our numbers.
717	If there is anything we can do to help you out, please let me know.
717	Thanks.
717	Lynn
718	Mike, I am covered as long as you or Jodie are attending.

722	Shirley, I have forwarded your message to John.
722	Thanks.
722	Lynn
723	FYI.
723	Thought you guys might be interested in this.
723	Thanks.
723	Lynn
724	Frank, thank you for the update.
724	I would like to attend this meeting.
724	Also I added Jodie and Steve on here, because they are very interested in the discussion as well.
724	I hope that is OK.
724	Thanks.
724	Lynn
725	Mary and Dari, here is my answer.
725	Are you comfortable with it before I send it to the shipper.
725	Thanks.
725	Lynn Answer: If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1 cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.
725	Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the operator of the point.
725	Therefore, they would not encounter a DDVC penalty.
725	If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines if a DDVC is appropriate.
725	The DDVC is based on the difference between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.
725	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
725	Lynn Blair (713-853-7637).
726	Mary, I am going to be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday of next week as well as Monday, November 26th.
726	Do you need me in the meeting?
726	If not John Buchanan can attend in my place.
726	Thanks.

727	Attached is a VERY HIGH level evacuation plan we can start with in the morning at 9:00 a.m. Don't panic, bring your additions and improvements to the meeting and we can modify this plan.
727	I just thought we could start with this.

797	Glen, I had a conversation with Pat Davidson (SoCal) yesterday.
797	Things have been going smoothly, because SoCal has not been calling any OFO days.
797	She felt like we would not have an issue until spring and at that time, there is an expectation that SoCal could be calling more OFOs.
797	We agreed to continue talking, but that does not resolve the issue completely.
797	Thanks.

813	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers: MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147) Interstate Power - 6 stations Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send us updates on the following information ASAP: 1.
813	Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.
813	2.
813	How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding 3.
813	Provide status of November chart information.
813	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time frame for the first prior period run.
813	This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
813	As you find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know.
813	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.
813	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.
813	If you have any questions, please let Rick or I know.
813	Thanks.
813	Lynn

856	Lynn
857	Sue, we have looked at an automated way to take care of this issue.
857	So far we have not found an exceptable change.
857	It is a timing issue with true ups from the previous day which are not completed before the current day calcuations are done.
857	It is an item we are manually monitoring today, but we are continuing to look for a better method.

860	Vernon, the way the accounting system works today: Dec. 1 - 20 flow will be attributed to the contract that nominated at that point for the 21 through 31.
860	This automaticall happens if there is no OBA at the point and if there is only one contract nominated at the point.

882	Thanks.
882	Lynn
883	John and Terry, could you check into having a Business Objects report done for all groupings with the following information.
883	Previous Cyclce Nomination Current Nomination Confirmation Schedule Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report.
883	The reason for the report - Gas Control needs to know what changes have taken place and this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report.
883	If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know.
883	I would like to be able run this report during cycle.
883	(I think I am probably asking for the moon), but that would be the best time for Gas Control.
883	Thanks.
883	Lynn
884	Rick, FYI.

889	Delaine Kurth with Oneok called today and wanted an OBA at the (Skellytown) Cargray Plant (POI 8442) effective 1/1/2002.
889	After talking with Vernon, I told her that we would draft an OBA on Wednesday with Month to Month cash out language in it.
889	She said to send her the contract and she will run the traps.
889	She was not excited about the monthly cash out requirement.
889	I told her if we could come to agreement we would make it effective 1/1/2002.
889	If we could not come to agreement, we would continue the same methodology as we have today, which is Oneok picks one of the transportation contracts at the Cargray tailgate to take any variances.

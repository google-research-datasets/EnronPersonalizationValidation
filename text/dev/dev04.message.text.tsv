0	Susie and I talked, she and I agreed that she would work 7-1 m-th, and 7-5 on fridays.
0	We had agreed to that before she left.
0	I also filled her in on our situation as a company, she had no idea.
0	I didn't want her to get blindsided by any kind of decision.
1	I am sorry you have been so sick!
1	That sounds just awful.
1	Are you all better now?
1	I can think of nothing worse than not being able to talk well!
1	My head would explode!
1	Love,
2	Good Morning, Diane is out today and all next week, so just call me Thanks, Cara Semperger
3	We did 50 HLH parking with PGE, please see Diana or me for details.
4	Thanks for that laugh!
4	I needed it.
4	Here's the deal: A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.
4	I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars.
4	I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.
4	I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.
4	My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.
4	My new Company is called "Cara-land".
4	I am working on the national anthem now.
5	The real cara comes out at last, you will notice schedulers working feverishly behind me
6	Thanks,
7	THANKS VISH.
7	I will let you know if any more bugz show up.
8	Just checking in to say hi.
8	Wanted to know what SLC is like ;)
9	Good Evening I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the "OFF PEAK" deals.
9	The deal numbers are: Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?
9	Here is my PSW sheet:
10	Diane is out all week, just call ol Cara to tell her all about it.
11	No, I will just make a note of these two strange deals
12	Tom and I confirmed this change via phone earlier.
13	Just let me know when the update has been done, and I will pop in and do a few more tags.
13	Thanks,
14	Good Afternoon, The last of our kinks has been worked out and we are going to go ahead with all schedules in the new system as of 11/15.
14	We will then have a good couple of weeks under our belt before the start of a new month.
14	The last date you will see any preschedules in Lotus is 11/14/01 Please see me if you have any questions.
14	Cara
15	Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day.
15	Any change to it must go thru me.
15	The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface.
15	Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.
15	Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.
15	Cara
16	Please copy me on anything that you need to speak to the developers on.
16	DART changes to the build route need to be done in the PreSchedule Workspace version of build route, as that is what we are using now, we have been phasing out the old build route.
16	Cara
17	Things are coming back a bit, here is your sheet
18	FOR YOUR EYES ONLY: I dont wanna piss off the new massa
19	Thank you Dave for the horribly long hours you put in on this.
20	I was able to access the record in path confrimation, and it has the correct info in it now.
21	I recognize those sunglasses!
21	ha ha ha!
22	Any ideas?
22	The time difference is from nearly instantaneous before to 20-30 seconds now.
23	Have a good day Cara Semperger
24	Hi Mom, I am so glad that Nathan seems to be responding, his well being and future are what is most important.
24	I don't know what to say to the behavior of Beth not taking responsibility for the financial end, and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren.
24	I have so little respect for her for treating people this way.
24	If I didn't think she would punish you somehow, I would tell her so.
24	I am looking forward to seeing you next week!
24	woohoo!
24	Cara
25	MUCH INTEREST FROM ME
26	Please have the default set to "Starting on" not "Active on".
26	We use Starting on Every day, and Active on much more rarely.
26	Thanks, Cara
27	The old build route remembered what the user chose last for delivery points, and had it in the defaults each time Build route was opened.
27	Can this be duplicated in the PSW version of build route?
28	His attempts to get path confirmation he gets this error ACCESS VIOLATION AT ADDRESS 005096E9 IN MODULE "PATH CONFIRM.EXE" READ OF ADDRESS 00000000.
28	He needs access asap.
28	Thanks, Cara
29	Hi Donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report.
29	Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if Donald will have time.
29	Maybe you can do this with Vish and Donald's Passwords?
29	Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.
29	I am just ducky.
30	I am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price!
30	I wanna do the 19 grand package.
30	Employees and Spouses.
30	Do for us but do the works.
30	I think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now.
31	I turned my computer completely off and back on to see if my connection would improve, It didn't.
31	My plain old data only no macro excel sheet still takes 30 seconds to save.
31	Outlook also seems slow, but I never liked it anyway.
31	:)
32	Mike Tully is going to work on this with you today.
33	It is slower today than it was last night, I assume from traffic
34	Y'all have a good weekend!
34	Cara Semperger
35	Forgot the 4 mw path, all good now.
35	Have a good weekend
36	I would be personally interested in going to D3, please try to plan it during mid month if possible.

43	Good Morning, Diane will give you the MidC position if there is one, and Stacy will have the Palo Position.
44	Good Afternoon, I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been populated.
44	I logged off and onto the system several times today to see if that would help.
44	It didn't.
45	Understood.
45	I had populated the market path first

51	PROLLY SHOULDN'T USE THE F WORD IN AN INTRA-COMPANY E-MAIL, PARDNER
52	Things are much better now, we only have minor issues with control areas, and none so specific as to be addressed in a formal way.
52	Thanks,
53	Other deals is fine, Build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine, and including them in the off peak sections.
53	We must be able to see these deals, as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules.
53	Thanks, Cara
54	I propose we just keep AOL
55	I got your res and will keep it in case I hear of anything.
55	Take mine, and put it in your just in case folder.
55	Love,
56	None of us can get on the main site, and we are using their alternate site.
56	I had some difficulty making tags, but have finished.
56	The problem I was having today is identical to my problem a few weeks ago where I could make the tag, but then everything would hang when I hit the 'confirm' button.
56	Cara Semperger
57	why is this coming from you?
58	Good Morning, Diane is off today and tomorrow, just call ol' cara with questions
59	I will be there with husband
60	I need a reccomendation.
60	Please let me know when you have a few minutes of spare time.
61	Stacy just ran her build route for December and got data with no counterparty names, I just ran my build route for December and got new data blended with old data.
61	We need help immediately Stacy's number is 503/464-3747
62	We need to be able to rely on the repeated running of the build route.
62	Running a month long sheet from scratch is a huge problem for us, it forces us to do massive amounts of work over and over again.
62	I need you to find out why this is happening, and let me know when it is fixed.
62	Cara
63	NICE!
63	HAVE A GOOD TIME
64	Good Afternoon Kathy, Please get susie a December Parking pass
65	We also need a box that says "Include only Dart Deals" Please also make absolutely sure that this is included in the PSW build route, as we use it nearly exclusively now.Vish knows about our problems with that.
65	Cara

68	It happened twice
69	Donald was trying to sort by POR AND POD, Donald gets a repeating error of "invalid variant type conversion".
69	I tried to do that and no problem, but I am using the app locally, and Donald for some reason still has to go thru the windows 2000 terminal server.
69	I really want him to be able to use the app locally like it was designed to be used.
69	Please let me know.
70	I have re-started Enpower since the e-mail came out saying that the new version has been put into production.

71	Please call me to confirm reciept
72	SOMETHING IS BROKEN WITH THE NEW RELEASE, NONE OF OUR LIGHT LOAD DEALS PULL IN!

73	Thanks for your help

85	I want each of you to get out of here for 30-45 mins, I will babysit your stuff while you are out.
86	Dave said he called you.
86	I feel awful.
87	I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.
87	Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.
87	I told them and they did it on the spot.
87	They also referred me to this website I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience Cara
88	Her mailbox must be full or something, we are getting her mail kicked back Can we tidy up her mail a bit, she returns on Tuesday
89	Thank you for your kind words.
89	This is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.
89	Dave needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends.
89	Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.
89	I am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends.
89	I promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.
89	Love,
90	No changes to any existing data, just adding Real Power Losses

92	Thanks, Cara
93	Put vending machines in where it says COWS, and you have the filed business plan for my new company
94	Hi Sweetie, I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
94	We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.
94	I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!
94	I love you, and Pat and Riley Cara
95	Hi Mom, I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.
95	I still can't believe that this has all happened.
95	Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset.
95	I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
95	He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance.
95	They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house.
95	I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance.
95	They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.
95	Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.
95	I love you, Cara
96	I can pop up today if you would like, Just give me a call and I can dash over.
96	Thanks,
97	thanks Tara
98	I propose that while work is so slow we have some informal tutorials from the folks who know stuff.
98	SQL Access Excel Stuff (Susie is a bona-fide expert teacher!) HTML XML Whatever folks might want to teach
99	There are BPA real power losses for the 7th only and some transmission only paths
100	I will be surrendering my cell phone when Enron no longer wishes to pay for it
101	I am still having lots of problems with OATI
102	Hi Mom, Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.
102	Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.
102	The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.
102	He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.
102	I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.
102	I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt.
102	I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
102	Just pray for him and for me.
102	School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones.
102	How fun!
102	I love you!
102	Cara
103	Hi Frank, Thanks for taking care of the password changes for our real time group.
103	Things are still very up in the air here.
103	We hear new developments nearly on a daily basis, and so much remains unknown.
103	I am in kind of a wait and see mode.
103	Thank you for asking!
103	Cara
104	I am interested in being part of this effort if there is still room
105	Hi, Yesterday Richter asked me to get with John Oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use.
105	Although I think this is a good idea, I think that this direction should more appropriately come from you.
105	Please let me know what you would like me to do, if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both John and Victor, I will be happy to do so.
105	Thanks,
106	Good Morning, Due to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.
106	They have a wide range of experience and abilities, and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling.
106	Please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 3 of these folks, I would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume.
106	Thanks, Cara
107	Let's meet tomorrow morning about 9 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses.
107	I expect it will take about 15 minutes.
107	Thanks, Cara
108	can you tell bob?
108	I got an undeliverable message from his e-mail address
109	we have to apply for TISN registration at NERC.com
110	I am unable to log on to local enpower, I get a dialog box that says the following Script: W:\Scripts\enpower.vbs Line: 476 Char: 13 Error: Permission Denied Code: 800A0046 Source: Microsoft VBScript runtime Error.
111	I tried to call, but got the 'all circuits are busy' thing a few times.
111	I will see you tonight at the movies with a full report!
112	I feel like a moron
113	nice
114	Hi, How are you?
114	Are you keeping busy or taking some days to decompress?
114	A few of us are going out to sushi tonight, Me, Laura W, Stacy, Perry, maybe Jesse, and a few others.
114	We would love to have you join us.
114	We are thinking Koji's on 6th and broadway around 7 ish.
114	Please join us if you would like.

118	Dear Little Sister, Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.
118	I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.
118	I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.
118	You will always be my little sister.
118	I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.
118	I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.
118	I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?
118	I hope so.
118	I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.
118	He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad.
118	I really didn't think he would be this upset.
118	I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support.
118	He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.
118	I love you, Cara "Pizza Pie"
119	I haven't heard any firm plans, but I am game for nearly anywhere maybe Perry can scare some folks up?
120	Hi Sweeties!
120	You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?
120	Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.
120	I love you and hope you all are well.
120	Cara
121	Hi Mom, I am amazed at those bear photos.
121	The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.
121	That guy must have filled his drawers!
121	How is Natalie doing?
121	What shot do they think she reacted to?
121	I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.
121	Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere.
121	I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping.
121	It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.
121	I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job.
121	We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.
121	I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.
121	Cara
122	Please see the attached spreadsheet, I have added leg 2 to both annuities in red.
122	I looked at the spreadsheet that Diana forwarded me, and probably need for you and I to sit down and just walk me thru it.
122	Cara
123	I threw the tree tag away, but I gave Lynn a bunch of bath goodies in the handle bag.
124	I am so glad you got internet service at home!
124	Earthlink is good.
124	Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.
124	Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now.
124	He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.
124	OK.
124	I have a truck now and he has the car.
124	Wanna buy a truck?
124	He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me.
124	It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.
124	I don't really want to be there either.
124	I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this.
124	I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries.
124	Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain.
124	Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry.
124	I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday.
124	Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.
124	I love you very much!
124	Thanks for keeping me in your heart.
124	Cara
125	Hey , is there any way on the face of the earth that I can get ahold of one of the remaining Drexler basketballs?
126	My boss just said "It's all good".
126	I laughed my ass off
127	Dear Mom, I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.
127	You still mean as much to me now as ever.
127	I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.
127	You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.
127	I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes.
127	Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything.
127	Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.
127	I am glad, things are very tense and weird.
127	I just want to get everything settled.
127	He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.
127	He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal.
127	I got him this truck to help him with his business.
127	Wanna buy a brand new truck?
127	Anyway, it will all work out and we will all get thru this .
127	I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.
127	Love,
128	It's all good.
129	Everyone keeps asking my why I am grinning today.
129	I thought I was playing it pretty straight.............................................
130	Should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?
130	I think it would be wise.
130	Also, If you want to transfer Pahio to our joint account that is fine, I would like to have Pahio.
130	When you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.
130	Just let me know.
130	Thanks,
131	Y'all have a good day.
132	Have a good day Cara
133	Cara's new number is
134	About another hour or so and I am outta here.
134	I am tired..........ti..............yerd.
134	I ran up and bought the Charlotte Church CD, listening to it now, it is very nice.
134	I will bring it home with me.
134	I would like to come over and finish that movie tonight for a bit, but I am going HOME to sleep ;) That ok?
135	Everything is wonderful......................just wonderful..............................there is a suprise on the way for you today from me.
135	Craig is so nice, we had a really good weekend.
135	Thanks for inviting me to your drunken bash!
136	Hi There, What a great e-mail!
136	I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.
136	I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.
136	I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.
136	I really enjoyed just vegging last night.
136	You have a good day too cutie pie.
137	Thanks Frank, Hey did that intermittent blank drop down field bug in the physical path area get fixed?
137	I tried doing a tag a few days ago and still got that error.
137	Have a good day, Cara
138	Hi Sweetie, I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.
138	I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating.
138	I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right.
138	I would like your advice on this matter.
138	I have been going to parties and movies and such, having fun.
138	I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig.
138	He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.
138	Talk to you later, have a good long weekend off.
138	I have a new cell phone number 810-1105 Cara

139	Cara (soon to be Freeland)
140	Hi, I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you.
140	You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished.
140	I would really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you.
140	I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my fireplace.
140	How does Christmas Eve sound?
140	Do you have plans?
140	Bye my special one, Kitten
141	Good Morning, I am going into a meeting at nine for I am not sure how long, so just leave a message if you have a problem or a question.
141	The loss schedule is per Crandall.
141	Cara
142	Hi Again, Just let me know about Lord of the Rings, when I am done here I am going home to take a nap if we aren't going.
142	If Saturday or Sunday would be a better lazy day than Christmas eve, then we can do whatever.
142	You are the only thing on my calendar after tonight, sir.
142	Call me at work, I would love to hear your voice.
143	Hi Donald, I got a smattering of information that the big E will probably go after us contract folks that attempt to defect.
143	So, I guess it's second jobs for both of us.
143	I am sorry I got you into this, buddy.
143	Cara
144	They think it is a proxy server on my end and that if it is removed we should be fine.
144	Can you help me with this?
145	Any news?
145	I am just thinking I will leave around 1 pm here to go home for a bit.
145	I don't have to be at this party till 7 ish, so if you wanna come hang out or just take a nap, you are welcome to do that.
146	Good Morning..........sir, I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me.
146	My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.
146	I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.
146	Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.
146	One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall.
146	I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.
146	I told him no more of that stuff.
146	On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.
146	You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.
147	Good Morning, Here is the preliminary stuff, direct bookouts and what is open.
147	Please call me at your convenience to talk about them.
148	This is the most complete information, Bilat stuff only.

149	come over at your convenience and I will explain all
150	Good Morning E Sure was fun!
150	Cara
151	I am officially playing hooky from work tomorrow.
152	I am here today for a few, what a rough ride that was.
152	If you have a few to stop by and say hi, that would be great.
153	I am at work for a few minutes and wanted to send you a quick note.
153	I sure loved having you at my house, our talking, and I really loved this morning.
153	You are such a wonderful man.
153	I am a very VERY lucky lady.
153	I love you and will see you tonight after my meeting.

156	Congratulations Steve!
156	How wonderful!
156	I love the name.
157	I have a new cell phone of my own, when can I start expensing that bad boy?
158	This might solve some of our login problems
159	I was tickled to get such a cool card!
159	Where did you find it?
159	I am thinking about taking the front off and putting it in a little frame.
159	I have decided to postpone the catchup Christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when I move into my NEW beautiful Condo that is right on a wetland/woods!
159	I go to sign papers today.
159	Thanks again,
160	Good Morning, Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group.
160	The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.
160	I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation.
160	Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.
160	Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.
160	His number is 503/464-3902 Thanks, Cara
161	You might want to check it Are you still planning to come up and sign papers tomorrow?
161	I need to know because I had to go back to work early.
161	Please call my cell phone when you get logged off so we can get in sync with plans.
162	Hi Dearie, How are you?
162	I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!
162	I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.
162	Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?
162	How is your husband?
162	How is your dog-bite scar?
162	Do you have any new Jewelry?
162	I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.
162	If you do come to stay, please stay with me.
162	I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful.
162	3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.
162	I miss you, Cara Poo
163	Good Morning Honey, I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.
163	Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love.
163	It was a sweet way to start the day.
163	Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes.
163	I wonder what will be said.
163	I will let you know everything.
163	On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home.
163	I love the sound of our home.
163	I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work.
163	Soon we will both just be home.
163	Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6.
163	If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?
163	I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication.
163	I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.
163	Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy.
163	I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses.
163	You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy.
163	I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes.
163	You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.
163	I love you, Cara
164	Someone sent this to me, it seemed appropriate!
164	Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football An old man and his wife have gone to bed.
164	After laying there a few minutes the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."
164	His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"
164	The old man replied, "It's fart football."
164	A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
164	After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm ahead 14 to 7."
164	Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
164	Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops the bed. The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"
164	And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."
165	Uh..........not when I came back to bed.
165	The score is now Craig 46, Cara 21
166	When you get a moment
167	k thanks
168	When you get the chance Thanks
169	I want to go to the 10 am meeting, as I am Cara Freeland now.

169	Cara
170	I got all my stuff signed and done yesterday, so I am now Cara Freeland.
170	I want to get changed over ASAP in the system.
170	Thanks for your help, support, and kind wishes.

172	Hi My Love, I have told Sylvia and Cheri about you, and how important you are to me.
172	Phase 1 is complete!
172	I am leaving in a few minutes for Bandon, and will drive sooooo carefully that it will become the stuff of legend.
172	I miss you already, it's going to be a long lonely weekend without you!
172	But I will see you on Sunday, and you are a DEAD MAN!
172	;) I love you, Cara P.S.
172	Don't cheat on your cards................................
172	:)
173	Mine is all done, whiz quiz completed and Paperwork given to Gabrielle Thanks.
173	Does this mean that the final stuff is done and we are all locked in for UBS?
173	I understood that there was one final thing to happen before we were officially 'done'
174	Hi Baby, The movie sounds good, nice and creepy!
174	I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing.
174	I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.
174	I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again.
174	I just wanted to hold on to you forever.
174	Those 2 romps were not bad either!
174	;) See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.
174	Love, CF
175	Please drop by when you can.
175	I get into regular Enpower but when I try to get into preschedule workspace I get an errr
176	What did she say?
177	Hi Sweetheart, The trip and all really took it out of me, I am taking off for home now, looking at a little nap action and then if I feel good start packing.
177	I love you and will see you this after noon.
177	Don't work my man too hard, but I will rub your feet when you get home if you do!
177	Love, CF
178	Good Morning Honey, I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today.
178	However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about.
178	Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.
178	Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.
178	You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me.
178	I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours.
178	I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.
178	I want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what I am going to do".
178	I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning.
178	The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.
178	I am looking forward to forever with you.
178	Love, CF
179	I tried to login with the est_csemper id in estate enpower, and was denied login
180	I was able to login to the main platform of Enpower under csemper, but not able to run psw or deal entry.
180	However, I was able to login as drobins and run things.
180	Please do what you can to get my login fixed today if possible.
180	I will use Donald's login as a workaround.
180	Thanks, Cara
181	Good Morning, Please look at this sheet and see if you agree with what I have done, e-mail me or call me at 877-464-7779.
181	Any of our schedulers can look at this and help you.
181	Thanks,
182	Good Morning, These are the positions that I see for February, please take a look at them and let me know if you agree or not.
182	Thanks,
183	Can you tell me if we are having subsidized parking and bus passes?
183	If not, I need to plan ahead.
183	Thanks,
184	I miss you and am wonderin how you are faring in the working world.
184	I have been checking in on the Riley photo site, she just gets more beautiful every day.
184	Dave and I have signed papers and are final, now I am just waiting for the house to sell.
184	I have already found another place to live, and have an offer on it based on the sale of my house.
184	I love you and hope to hear from you soon.
184	Cara
185	Let me know if your stuff does not pull in correctly from Enpower or you have any other problems.
185	Thanks!
186	Hi Sweetie, Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand?
186	(That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there.
186	You need to fix that ( or those as it were).
186	Please let me know what the dr.
186	says.
186	The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.
186	I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either.
186	I need to vacuum but that is all.
186	I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy.
186	I want us to be happy together for many years to come.
186	I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.
186	See you tonight,
187	Bill and I are considering having Real time do the EPE preschedules since they are the ones that live and die by them anyway.
187	That way you would be released from that burden and any errors would be all on the ownership of RT.
188	Donald will be helping you with that, he has taken over the NW now for Feb. Thanks,
189	Thanks for your addy, it was so good to hear your little voice yesterday!
189	Things are sure different here, Mark and Tom are not staying, Holden is in real time, and possibly Mallory will trade the SW.
189	I miss YOU!
190	Hi Honey, I hope you are having a good day, I sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning.
190	(Although I had a little bout of blue bush) I just love having you around all the time.
190	I don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, I wanna take us out to dinner.
190	Where would you like to go?
190	Or we can be turds again tonight and to to YOKO's tomorrow, or whatever.
190	I am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate VS the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.
190	I love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!
190	Love, Cara Freeland
191	You are so cute!
191	Next time you work a day shift, call me and we will go have coffee and Iwill give you all the sordid details of my divorce and my now nearly 7 week stand.
191	Juicy juicy stuff!
192	Good Afternoon Sweeite, I have my new driver's license and my divorce papers to change my name over to just plain Cara Freeland.
192	Do I send them to you or what do I do?
192	also- Have you heard if parking or Tri-met will be subsidized at all in the New World Order?
192	Lemmie Know, Cara Freeland
193	These are the open positions for the Month of February.
193	This is the best way to see our obligations.
194	Tim, I just want to tell you how much I respect and admire how you have handled this situation.
194	It is not lost on many of us that we owe not only our bonuses but also our jobs to you personally.
194	I am glad to be part of the new crew, and wanted you to know that I am grateful for all of your efforts on my behalf over the years.
194	It is not often that an assistant is given the opportunities to advance that I was given.
194	Thank you.
194	Cara
195	Not always feeling better.
195	I am very sore today

208	She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym!
208	Your ASS is MINE!
208	;) She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly.

212	Woohoo!
212	I love you, CF
213	Good Morning Darling, Do you know when the UBS paydays are?
213	We are just trying to figure out what to expect.
213	Also, I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.
213	If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.
213	Thanks, Cara Freeland!
213	;)
214	I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.
215	Good Morning, I never got a copy of my UBS agreement, and Amy said you have been keeping them in case something happened to the FED-EX packages?
215	I can run up and grab it anytime.
215	Thanks, Cara Freeland!
215	:)
216	no worries,.

217	she said she would get it for me after this conference call.
217	Are there going to be more Enron layoffs?
218	I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.
218	They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.

222	Let me know if that doesn't do it.

224	What did I ever do to deserve you!

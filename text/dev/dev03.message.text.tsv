136	Shelley, My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in economics, wrote a short summary of arguments against the ROFR.
136	We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option.
136	The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences: he has something of value he never paid for.
136	Having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it.
136	The value of such an option is case specific; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

137	Vince Kaminski Enron North America Corp.
138	George, This is the first cut at the problem you gave us, done by my associate Clayton Vernon.

303	Ravi, The proposed dates work for me.
303	Vince
304	Celeste, I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but I cannot find a copy in my msg folder.
304	There might have been a glitch in the and the message did not go through and wasn't stored.
304	I wanted to make the following points: 1.
304	Brad will not show up on March 15.
304	He is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity.
304	2.
304	My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand.
304	Either Brad or a stipend refund check should show up on March 15.
304	3.
304	I told Brad that a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with Enron.
304	We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs.
304	If he decides to re-apply at some point in the future, we shall not hold his decision to pursue him entrepreneurial plans against him.
304	Please, let me know what you think.

493	I have the files on my laptop.
493	I shall bring it to work to morrow and send it to you.
493	Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start showing up).

495	I have already talked to him.

497	We have no time unless he brings something special to the table.
497	Vince Enron North America Corp.
498	My preference is C, because of its portability.

512	I can also prepare a set of transparencies if this is more convenient for you.
512	Vince
513	Steve, The schedule is fine with me.
513	One consideration is that in 2 cases it would require two, as opposed to one, round trips.
513	Please, talk to Dale about it and make sure that it is fine with Richard and the RAC group (they will have to pay for it).
513	Vince
514	FYI Vince

518	Sorry I shall miss you on Thursday.
518	I shall definitely attend you presentation at Power 2000.
518	I shall ask about a guest accounton EOL.
518	Typically, such an account allows an outside user to take a look at the system, but I don't think the traders will allow systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third party.
518	Vince
519	Approved.

524	Please include me, Tanya Tamarchenko, Ted Murphy, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, Grant Masson.
524	I asked Liza to talk to you to set up formal arrangements with Enron HR (a contract, fee schedule approval, etc.).
524	I shall ask you for help next week when we have more information: several members of our group from London will rotate through our Houston office this summer.
524	We shall need help in making living arrangements, including apartments, car, etc. Also, we have an employee from India rotating through our group this summer.
524	Please, let me know who is the best person in HR to ask for assistance.

531	Grant 3.
531	Krishna 4.
531	Tanya 6.
531	Paulo I shall talk to him for 5 minutes Vince
532	Steve, I can pick up the cost of your trip from the Research Group budget.
532	The more I think about it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult to justify 2 trips per person.
532	I think that we should go for one contiguous stay per person and make a good effort to make these trips productive.
532	Vince
533	Shirley, How are we doing on bringibg these people to Houston for an interview?
533	Vince
534	Dale, Richard, I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the summer).
534	I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his horizons.
534	I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader in not too distant future.
534	He needs exposure to more diverse business problems and areas of research.
534	I think it will be in the best interest of the company to devote some resources to foster his development.
534	Vince
535	Molly, I am enclosing my recommendation letter for Yvan Chaxel.
535	Vince
536	Let's bring up these two ideas at the meeting with John Bloomer (to discuss the other product ideas).

538	Hi Jana, Saturday, May the 20th looks good.

539	My treat.
539	Vince
540	Steve, The slides are OK.
540	How are the negotiations with RISK proceeding?
540	They had recently many changes (firing people).
540	Vince
541	Kevin, OK.
541	Vince
542	Nick, The airport is about 30 minutes by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
542	The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making reservations).
542	The hotels are within a walking distance from the Enron building.
542	We can make reservations for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00 in a resturant within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.
542	By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related expenses.
542	Vince
543	Sue, I shall be available.
543	Vince
544	Greg, As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.
544	The offer from Enron looks much better now.
544	I have arranged for him a number of different interviews (including one with you).
544	I think we should not be too punitive and give him the 2nd chance.
544	I am also setting up for him interviews with RAC and EBS and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.
544	Please, give me a call if you have any other question.
544	Vince Kaminski
545	Betty, Thanks.
545	Vince
546	Shirley, Please keep it on your radar screen.
546	Vince
547	Celeste, I am forwarding you a letter from Prof. Duane Seppi from Carnegie Mellon University.
547	I have known Duane for many years and I know that he does not make his recommendations without very good reasons.
547	I would recommend looking at John Gordon as a very strong candidate: I think he will make a terrific contribution to Enron.
547	Vince
548	John, This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.
548	1.
548	I was not involved in the LNG ship project.
548	I shall read the DASH and give you my comments.
548	Without looking at the details, I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2).
548	2.
548	Elba Island.
548	I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction.
548	The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges.
548	A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.
548	A few comments on the book design and my view of the project: a.
548	The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis.
548	Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.
548	The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-term contract prices.
548	The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US.
548	In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.
548	b.
548	The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension option of 5 years).
548	Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for such a long tenor.
548	This is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.
548	One solution would be to cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.
548	c.
548	The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.
548	d.
548	My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
548	Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent.
548	Vince

560	Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived.
560	It has been four years since the first edition was published.
560	During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline.
560	The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.
560	The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity.
560	As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope.
560	It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry.
560	Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors.
560	Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material.
560	In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation.
560	For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments.
560	Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22).
560	Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.
560	The second edition however is not without flaws.
560	In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques.
560	Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments.
560	In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges.
560	In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran.
560	It is a welcome edition to any risk management library.

576	Steve, The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication than RISK MAgazine.
576	If the article is published it will give you more exposure in the academic circles.
576	I think it will be a significant accomplishment.
576	On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK among the practitioners.
576	I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

620	Jeff, I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 30 minutes to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
620	A separate message about this visit will follow.
620	I would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships with different universities.
620	Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.
620	We should rethink the way we work with universities.
620	The efforts to get the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we are not very successful.
620	It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways: 1.
620	Involvement in research projects.
620	For example, we are currently underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving Ph.D.
620	students of Professor Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks).
620	We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
620	Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and also to lock-up some very promising students.
620	Most companies in the high tech industries have such programs.
620	2.
620	Lectures and presentations by Enron employees.
620	Practically every presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes and hiring decisions.
620	It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic program.
620	In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach them during their senior years.
620	3.
620	Visits by faculty members in Enron.
620	Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to getting the best students and obtaining access to current research.
620	The universities are very important in shaping public opinion on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of deregulation and design of new markets).
620	Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees.
620	In many cases, there is no continuity and focus.
620	I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities.
620	This function would be separate from our Analyst/Associate program.
620	I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

622	One of the potential topics is emerging technologies.
622	The Wharton offers a symposium in Paris on June 10 on High Tech Acquisitions and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to evaluate the usefulness of this project.

645	An interesting piece of information from the oil markets.
645	Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).
645	The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst).
645	He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations.
645	He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets.
645	I personally discount this info: the volume and transparency of the oil markets would not support this type of huge scale operations by Saddam's government.

677	Vince
678	John, I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out in other messages).
678	Being aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.
678	Now a few more detailed comments.
678	1.
678	I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate.
678	Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth.
678	One should apply a haircut if liquidating a position takes a long time.
678	The approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid.
678	This illiquidity is recognized through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.
678	If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent and use this approach across the board for all project finance type cases (not that I recommend this course of action).
678	2.
678	Valuation of an unheadgable options.
678	Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.
678	He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges).
678	The issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy.
678	The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors: 1.
678	risk preference 2.
678	existing portfolio positions Risk preference.
678	Insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss.
678	The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 standard deviations.
678	The number of standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss.
678	I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works.
678	We looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke.
678	You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more about it.
678	Existing portfolio positions.
678	An additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio.
678	I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).
678	What are the practical implications?
678	Pricing depends on risk appetite (the utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.
678	If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).
678	If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium.
678	In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed.
678	If he cannot hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option.
678	How big is the discount?
678	See the comments above.
678	In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs).
678	The values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge.
678	3.
678	What happens in case we use simulation technology?
678	We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
678	If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of NPV as of today.
678	Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases we are still holding it.
678	The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk.
678	This is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium.
678	I hope this helps.
678	Please, call me with additional questions.
678	Sorry for a delay in responding to this question.
678	I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we all agree.
678	It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not have good answers.

745	As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).
745	Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
745	You sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot = 100 shares).
745	The price goes to You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position.
745	Option exercise gives you $30,000.
745	This is before taxes.
745	You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income).
745	The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400.
745	You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income.
745	This saves you only $840 in taxes.
745	Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option position as an offset.
745	The remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in the future (or capital gains).
745	Not so good.
745	By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.

762	Erin, A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers.
762	The book has an endorsement by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.
762	The Research Group offered several one-day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry.
762	We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested.
762	We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall.
762	The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business.
762	The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired power plants).
762	The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty.
762	Nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier.
762	Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, optimistic, pessimistic).
762	These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.
762	The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and (2) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk.
762	This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions.
762	Forward-looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project.
762	The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world.
762	The real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way.
762	I have seen in my career (almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers.
762	The challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models.
762	It is especially critical to stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions.
762	If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions.
762	I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices, but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend.
762	One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.

798	Ted, We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions.
798	Many thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead in this effort.
798	We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee.
798	We want to validate some inputs before releasing the number.
798	Specifically, I want to make sure that both London and Houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.
798	A few comments.
798	1.
798	We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston (Cantekin) and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
798	The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to multiple inquiries in both locations.
798	(Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).
798	2.
798	It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated positions and prices on a regular basis.
798	3.
798	We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model.
798	Two critical areas: a.
798	VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its portfolios.
798	This is the liquidity risk resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the underlying positions.
798	b.
798	We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating the position numbers (i.e. look into the details of specific transactions).
798	From what I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option prices (and deltas).
798	They get some option prices by calling brokers.
798	4.
798	I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the inputs are right).
798	But, as I have said, VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.
798	Vince
799	Osman, Yes, but a visa may be a problem.
799	Vince

807	Hi Jana, The trip was very interesting and I am still recovering.
807	On Friday we can meet at the restaurant.
807	It's on the edge of the Woodlands.
807	We can then go to our home and have drinks and chat.
807	The restaurant is: Amerigo's Grill 25250 Grogans Park Dr Phone: 281-362-0808 I have sent you an URL of the map of the part of the Woodlands where Amerigo's is located.
807	It's a red dot on the map.
807	What about 7:00 p.m.?
807	Look forward to meeting you.
807	Vince
808	Hi Jana, The dress is casual.
808	In this restaurant we can sit outside (quite casual) or inside (more formal dress, but still casual).
808	I shall also send you the directions to my home, just in case.
808	Vince
809	John, I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.
809	As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research Group, is moving to EBS.
809	Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currently in London.
809	Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston, it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.
809	My recommendation is Steve Leppard.
809	Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader, highly respected by his peers and internal customers.
809	Steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent.
809	His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron.
809	I value technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliber as Steve.
809	However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houston for 2 years.
809	I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron.
809	By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved.
809	Please, let me know what you think.
809	Vince
810	We can offer him a job.
810	The problem is, he has about 2 more years to go.
810	Vince
811	Anita, My version.
811	Minor changes.
811	Vince
812	Amy, My bio.
812	Vince
813	Mike, Please, draft a message to JS, DD and JL outlining the AGA benefits and costs.
813	This will be their decision.
813	Vince
814	Mark, Steve's comment has many merits.
814	I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson (physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.
814	On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in their time estimates, the technology they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous potential payoffs.
814	It make sense to stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities.
814	Vince
815	We would like you to meet tomorrow morning, starting at 9:00, with a few members of the group.
815	Around 11:15 we shall go to lunch (myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin At 1:00 we would like you to make a presentation to the Research Group on the topic of your choice. After 2:30 we shall continue with individual meetings. We shall give you an agenda with the names and times when you arrive. You can come to the lobby of the Enron building (1400 Smith) between 8:30 and 9:00 and call me (3-3848) or my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (3-5290), to be admitted to the building. We are on the 19th floor. Look forward to meeting you. Vince Kaminski
816	Richard, Please, let me know what the timetable is.
816	I would like to talk to Anjam a few days before to break the news to him.
816	I hope I can save him for the company and offer him a position in Houston.
816	We desperately need skills he has.

824	I am familiar with the Computational Finance program and value its high quality.
824	Please, call me next week.
824	The best time is between 7:00 and 8:30 a.m. CST.
824	Vince
825	Kevin, Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer.
825	Clayton received a conditional approval contingent upon completion of the current project he works on.
825	Vasant will formulate exact definition of the deliverables and we will hold Clayton to it.
825	If he fails to deliver the request for transfer will be rejected.
825	Anything else would be highly demoralizing to everybody.
825	Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) though he was advertising the projects inside and outside the group as completed.
825	I want you to be aware of it, because I have serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.
825	Vince
826	John, I saw it.

858	Jeff, I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May.
858	Tom is a Corporate Relations Officer at Wharton.
858	Recommendation.
858	I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
858	The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation.
858	Currently, the partnership supports alliances with approximately 200 companies worldwide.
858	The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K, that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.
858	The contribution is executed through grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron.
858	The choice of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time depending on the business needs.
858	Benefits to Enron.
858	Enron can benefit from the Partnership by: - gaining advance access to current academic research - significantly increasing our presence and visibility on the campus, enhancing our recruiting efforts - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant influence on public opinion - gaining access to high quality executive education programs Specific Programs.
858	The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects.
858	I have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.
858	1.
858	WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative).
858	This programs provides an umbrella for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research and corporate engagement related to e-commerce.
858	Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and enhanced recruitment opportunities.
858	2.
858	Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.
858	Interdisciplinary program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing intellectual property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal organizational structures.
858	Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of valuation of intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.
858	3.
858	Risk Management and Decision Process Center.
858	Development of techniques for assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the scope of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments).
858	Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination of information about our capabilities in this area.
858	Potential users of the program at Enron.
858	My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and Decision Process Center.
858	Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI.
858	Several different units of Enron can be involved with Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

864	My preference is to move Anjam to Houston for some time.
864	Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions and it's better to prevent a potential leak.
864	I have discussed this issue with Dale and Richard and they concurred.
864	I don't expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than sorry.

872	One think to double check is units.
872	Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions come in. One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing with different cultures (metric system vs. English measures).
872	Vince Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe
873	I am forwarding to you a paper by some UT professors.
873	They approached us about the possibility of licensing this technology to us.
873	Under the nondisclosure agreement, we have to give them an answer in 90 days and tell them why we don't want to use it (if we decline the offer).
873	Please, don't circulate the paper to other members of the group without letting them know that it's confidential and should not leave Enron.
873	In any case, please, let me know who else saw the paper.
873	We should make sure that the circulation is limited so that it does not leak out.

1006	I don't know the labor market in London that well but here the market for quants is very hot.
1006	Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person and I would go an extra mile to retain him long-term for the company.
1006	I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
1006	o62,000 Basic is what Anjam is receiving currently (if I remember correctly).
1006	Steve has a much higher value to Enron than Anjam.
1006	Vince
1007	Ashley, I agree with you.
1007	Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel rearranges the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well.

1010	Thanks.
1010	Vince
1011	Chris, This is very well written and will serve the reader well.
1011	A few comments.
1011	1.
1011	When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the classification based on 3 categories: a.
1011	variance/covariance method b.
1011	historical simulation c.
1011	Monte Carlo simulation.
1011	Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument.
1011	2.
1011	I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio.
1011	The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) that may involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).
1011	The main benefit of using the MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way.
1011	I would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you the references from home).
1011	3.
1011	I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).
1011	4.
1011	For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
1011	This process may be a source of a big error.
1011	5.
1011	The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error.
1011	Many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments).
1011	Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).
1011	Vince
1012	Steve, Friday, September 8, 11:30 is fine with me.

1128	Shirley, Please, send him my bio.
1128	Vince
1129	Mark, Two points.
1129	1.
1129	You probably know about it already.
1129	ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power Play", is on a tour of the United States.
1129	Please, take a look at the information about a meeting last Sunday at Stanford University.
1129	The web site address is given below.
1129	My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron.
1129	About 40 people attended.
1129	2.
1129	I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal.
1129	He wanted to work on an article on EBS.
1129	I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself.
1129	I made a few points to John: a.
1129	Enron's evolution did not just happen by accident.
1129	It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.
1129	b.
1129	In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment.
1129	I came up with a term "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."
1129	c.
1129	The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.
1129	d.
1129	There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.
1129	Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key players.
1129	Let me know what you thing about it.
1129	John is really excited about this paper.
1129	Vince
1130	Yes, we are ready.
1130	I shall be accompanied by one person from our Analyst/Associate program and I would like to ask you if she can be invited to dinner as well.
1130	We plan to come Thursday night and leave on Sat morning to avoid potential flight delay risk.

1131	Toni, I would like to bring two people for an interview One of them sent me a message that is attached below.

1131	I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler, Alex Tang on the interview list.
1131	It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday.
1131	Tanya will be at a training course next week.
1131	This means that if Friday this week is too aggressive, we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks.
1131	Sorry for a short notice.
1131	Vince Jermakyan, Martin

1149	I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important chapters.
1149	I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of the book.
1149	In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. Mehta.
1149	The person in charge of our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an invitation to speak at the same forum and present the facts as they are.
1149	He should be here for the management conference.

1190	1.
1190	Jeremy Blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the level of our support of EES.
1190	It probably makes sense to set up a meeting with Jeremy ASAP and discuss specifics (you, me, and it probably makes sense to invite Marty as well).
1190	2.
1190	George Posey called and asked fro help with statistical sampling of Dublin customers.
1190	Please, give him a call to set up a meeting.

1207	Ashley, Another student who responded after my presentation.

1209	I really want to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in my recruiting efforts.

1222	Steve, All these provisions make a lot of sense.
1222	Anjam showed very poor judgment one more time.
1222	He got a very generous offer to move to Houston.
1222	I recommend keeping him on the payroll, and at home, as long as possible.
1222	Vince

1232	Curve validation is normally a RAC prerogative and I shall get them involved on Monday Vince
1233	David, This is the outline of the EWRM project.
1233	Vince
1234	John, I am forwarding to you the request by Jens.
1234	We gave in the past our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics.

1234	Vince
1235	Paul, Thanks for your message.
1235	Look fwd to your call.
1235	Vince
1236	Ted Murphy sees the curve validation issue as the RAC prerogative.
1236	I shall contact him and offer our help in the curve review process.
1236	Vince
1237	Ted, I agree.
1237	Curve review has always been RAC responsibility.
1237	Please, let me know if we can assist you in any way.
1237	Vince
1238	Julie, This message was returned to me a few times when I sent it from my home address.

1241	I was under the impression the presentation will be at 3:30.
1241	11:30 is fine with me but want to confirm it.
1241	Vince
1242	Molly, I would like to invite this student for an interview, sometimes in late December when things slow down.
1242	Interviews with all my direct reports and George Hopley.
1242	Vince
1243	Scott, Not at all.
1243	I left to make a quick call and it required a number of follow-up calls.
1243	The presentation was very interesting and professional.
1243	One of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software packages.
1243	Otherwise, everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose economies of scale.
1243	I shall talk to my associates about your product and get back to you.
1243	Vince
1244	Mike, We shall call you to schedule a meeting to review the product.
1244	Vince

1245	They have an office in Houston.

1246	Vince
1247	Shirley, I hope it's OK with the apartment company.
1247	Vince
1248	Julie, A clarification.
1248	We had an agreement with Chris and Les to contribute AUS as a part of the cost.
1248	Vince
1249	Who coukd help with curve extraction?
1249	Vince
1250	John, I talked to Dale Nesbitt.
1250	He suggested that the best way to evaluate his model is to go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his company.
1250	Our cost is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase price of $55,000, in case we buy the software package.
1250	The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required level of support.
1250	Dale will be in Houston next week.
1250	I have tentatively invited him to visit with us on Tuesday, November 7, at 3:00 p.m.
1250	He will adjust if you are busy at this time.
1250	Please, let me know what you think.
1250	Vince
1251	It should be in the attached message.
1251	Vince
1252	The time of the presentation, 11:30 is fine with me.
1252	I shall arrive Thu evening and I shall get to the hotel by cab.
1252	Thanks for your kind offer to meet me at the airport but I shall be arriving at late hour and don't want to inconvenience you.

1307	Poetry Analysis/ Discussion Tulips The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
1307	Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
1307	I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
1307	I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
1307	I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.
1307	They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
1307	Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.
1307	My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
1307	They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.
1307	I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
1307	They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
1307	Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
1307	I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.
1307	I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
1307	How free it is, you have no idea how free - The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
1307	It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.
1307	The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
1307	Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
1307	Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
1307	They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.
1307	Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
1307	The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.
1307	Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
1307	Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
1307	Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
1307	They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.
1307	The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
1307	The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
1307	The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.
1308	Look forward to meeting you in Houston.
1308	What about Wednesday, Vince
1309	Confirmed.

1333	Vince
1334	Lance, Please, ask Shirley to order.
1334	Vince
1335	Gentlemen, I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 power trading desks.
1335	I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).
1335	Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it very useful for modeling transmission problems.
1335	Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this recommendation.

1336	Molly, It would be Tanya.
1336	Vince Enron North America Corp.
1337	Eric, I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge.
1337	I know that Peter Tufano was working on it but when I checked the HBS site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it.
1337	When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was ready and he was going through Enron's internal approvals.
1337	I cc Mark Palmer on it.
1337	Maybe he knows about this specific case study.
1337	I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.
1337	Vince
1338	Mark, It was done in collaboration with John Sherriff.
1338	Vince
1339	Rick and Ted, It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding chicken houses.
1339	I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under the hood and examine the mechanics of the model in order to sign off on it.
1339	A dog and pony show is not sufficient.
1339	In any case, the decision to approve the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee.
1339	Please, let me know what your thinking is.

1340	Location 0-413 PIN 003778
1341	Bryan, We shall be glad to take a look at the system.
1341	To sign - off on the vendor provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms.
1341	I hope the vendor will have no objections to it.
1341	Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the system you want to buy with the rest of VaR/credit systems.
1341	We shall stand by to help in this endeavor.
1341	An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be rolled into the existing risk systems.

1350	Kevin, Lunch with Kristin is scheduled for the 20th of this month (Monday).
1350	Vince
1351	Tanya, Naveen, Just a thought.
1351	Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes of prices and positions.
1351	This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas portfolio.
1351	A big jump in the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big.
1351	If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there should be no discrepancy between your numbers.
1351	Of course, the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes.
1351	Vince
1352	Sam, This is the paper by Sharad.
1352	I shall Stinson to do some editing.

1520	"The Return of Grant Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth opportunities (and that I am good manager).
1520	Grant would come back to his original VP position.

1547	David, The CUSIP of the bond I have is 694308EF0 Vince
1548	Molly, It seems that we got only Bill Bradford so far.
1548	Given that almost everybody will be out that week, we probably should move the interview to the beginning of January, even if it means higher costs.
1548	Vince Enron North America Corp.
1549	Sam, Are you sure you cannot make it just for a few minutes?
1549	Vince Enron North America Corp.
1550	Becky, The charges to Corp. go to RAC and are based on my projections of expected expenses.
1550	The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the parenthesis show amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to RAC: 1.
1550	Value-at-Risk Group (VaR) MD (25%) VP (60%) Director (100%) 2.
1550	Enterprise wide risk management Manager (100%) Associate (100%) Currently we hired (or will shortly hire) 4 managers for the VaR group.
1550	The expansion of the VaR group was planned based on the requests from RAC for more support.

1551	Dolores, I am glad you liked it.
1551	Merry Christmas.
1551	Vince
1552	Kay, I am glad you liked it.
1552	Merry Christmas.
1552	Vince
1553	Best holiday wishes to you and your family.
1553	I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference I have approached a number of executives at Enron.
1553	Greg Whalley speaks in London a day before.
1553	Louise Kitchen, the mother of EnronOnline will ski (this is the week of school holidays in England and her family will come here).
1553	One suggestion I want to make is Rick Causey.
1553	I talked to him and he is willing to be a speaker.
1553	He is a very senior and important executive of Enron and a UT grad.
1553	Any thoughts?
1553	Vince
1554	Krishna, It looks like a long shot.
1554	It will take a long time to bring this person here.
1554	Vince
1555	FYI Vince P.S.
1555	Meeting on Wed at 10
1556	Thanks, I shall attend.
1556	Vince Kaminski
1557	Jim, Thanks a lot.
1557	It is difficult to find a better example example of commitment to Enron and to professional excellence than our weather guys.
1557	Vince
1558	Gerry, Let me review my calendar in the beginning of the next year and I shall E-mail you with a suggested date.
1558	My assistant will update my schedule for 2001 in the first week of January and I shall be able to select a date for ypur presentaton.

1560	Dave, I am sending you my accomplishments for the last year.
1560	I am including also one document (just browse through it quickly) to give you a flavor of some projects I have been working on.
1560	I shall send you shortly an additional document I would like you to browse through (the list of projects my group works on in a typical week) to give you more information about the scope and depth of what we do.
1560	It's an internal document and I want to clean it up Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and your family.
1560	Vince
1561	Mike, The project list I am currently updating.
1561	Vince
1562	This list goes to Dave Delainey.
1562	Please, make sure everything is current.
1562	Vince
1563	Shirley, Please, register me, Lance and Alex for this event.
1563	Vince
1564	Mike, Please, schedule an interview with this guy.
1564	Vince
1565	Valery, I am interested in receiving the preprint.
1565	On another note, I would be glad to meet you for lunch/dinner sometimes during the next few weeks.
1565	Please, let me know what would be the best time to meet.
1565	Vince
1566	Nick, Thanks for your message.
1566	My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays and this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.
1566	I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend.
1566	Let's plan to meet for dinner then.
1566	I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research project.
1566	We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
1566	It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection of the research topics.
1566	We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
1566	Everybody was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall welcome him with open arms.
1566	I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.
1566	Vince

1571	I shall get in touch with you before coming to New York City.
1571	Happy Holidays an the best of luck.

1575	Eugene, No problem.
1575	Please, contact Stinson Gibner or Zimin Lu.
1575	Vince
1576	Sheila, I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago.
1576	I want to ask you for advice how to handle this case.
1576	My first reaction was to ignore it.
1576	The longer I think about it, the more convinced I become that some action is required.
1576	Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a female employee was harassed by a male colleague.
1576	An employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it.
1576	In many similar cases, courts subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints.
1576	The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial.
1576	If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double standard in handling sexual harassment cases.
1576	My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and sexual harassment prevention class.
1576	Please, let me know what you think.
1576	Sorry to burden you with this case.
1576	Vince
1577	Please, renew it.
1577	Vince
1578	Chris, The phone has been found and has not been compromised in any way.
1578	Can you, please, restore the service.
1578	Thanks.

1579	Happy New Year.
1579	Vince Kaminski P.S.
1579	You can also use vkamins@enron.com It used to be vkamins@enron.ect.com
1580	FYI Vince
1581	Please, use a new template stored in the Plans2001 folder for today's project lists.
1581	Over the last few weeks we had several parallel copies of the same file floating around.
1581	I have updated he list of group members in the first sheet.
1581	Please, make sure I have not omitted anybody.
1581	Vince
1582	Keith, Thanks.
1582	My home address is vkaminski@aol.com, not wkaminski@aol.com.
1582	The name starts with v. Vince
1583	To all whom it may concern: I keep receiving such unsolicited messages (please, see below) that represent an obvious scam.
1583	Is there any way to block out the messages from this source?
1583	I assume other employees of Enron are also being hit.
1583	Vince Kaminski
1584	Shirley, I think it's a growing problem of junk mail that is being sent indiscriminately to everybody.
1584	Sometimes it comes from legitimate institutions, sometimes it represents scams.
1584	I got a message today about diamonds in Sierra Leone.
1584	Vince
1585	I am glad I could help.
1585	Look forward to working with you.
1585	Vince
1586	John, Thanks a lot.
1586	Vince
1587	John, I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts.
1587	I could not agree more.
1587	Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional contribution.
1587	Additional recommendation.
1587	I think that all weather forecasting support should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting power trading).
1587	In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from power support.
1587	It would also mean a lot to him personally.
1587	Vince
1588	Dear Sir, I would like to apologize for the delay in responding to your fax.
1588	I was on vacation for the last few days.
1588	I shall be honored to meet your delegation on Thursday, February 8 at 10:00 Please, let me know if you will be free for lunch after the meeting.

1591	I look forward to our meeting on February 8.
1591	Vince Kaminski
1592	Osman, Kevin Kindall is working on the methods for operational risk.
1592	Please, schedule a meeting with him and Tanya (myself included).
1592	Vince
1593	I have talked to Alex about it.
1593	I don't think that the additional seminars will crowd out the brown bag lunches.
1593	The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.
1593	For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake.
1593	Brown bag lunches are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.
1593	Plus, we ran out of days available for lunch meetings.
1593	Vince
1594	Margaret, The forward power and gas price curves, unlike NYMEX futures prices, are not publicly available and are a closely guarded secret of the trading desks.
1594	We have no authority to release them without getting the head of the trading desk involved.
1594	Vince
1595	To Keith
1596	Greg, As a follow up.
1596	We are talking to Jay Webb today about the data we can get from the Enron OnLine system to develop an early warning system for automated crude trading.
1596	By the way, it was a good catch.
1596	You left us red faced.
1596	Vince
1597	Can you schedule a brainstorming session with Vasant, Tanya, Rakesh, myself and Ben (if possible)?
1597	What about the trip on Monday.
1597	Has it been scheduled?

1602	Look forward to working with you in 2001.
1602	Can you send the resume of L Xu to me in an electronic form?
1602	Thanks Vince
1603	Shirley, I might have already sent it to you with a request to renew.
1603	Vince
1604	Sally, I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
1604	They renewed their request for Enron's participation.
1604	What is your view on this?
1604	Do you think the benefits of knowing what's going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the project.
1604	My recommendation is to forget it.
1604	Vince
1605	1.
1605	Presentation 2.
1605	John Martin
1606	This is the presentation.
1606	Sorry for the delay.
1606	Vince
1607	Michele, I have defined the project for the students.
1607	It's one project that is divided into three sections.
1607	Feel free to stop by to talk about it.
1607	Vince
1608	Valery, I may be in Dallas in the next few weeks.
1608	I shall probably come to Dallas one Friday.
1608	I shall let you know well in advance.

1609	FYI Vince
1610	Ashley, Thnaks.
1610	I shall attend the reception.
1610	I shall ask Shirley to set up a meeting with you to discuss spring events on campus.
1610	Vince
1611	Please, resend the message.
1611	I cannot open the document.
1611	Vince Kaminski
1612	This was perfectly all right.
1612	As a matter of fact I expect and encourage the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) on any subject.
1612	I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s convictions.
1612	Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything.
1612	The only way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the company) is by having open communication.
1612	In Enron, facts are friendly.
1612	By the way, it was an excellent presentation.
1612	Vince
1613	Shirley, I don't have the resume.
1613	We can ask Jennifer Burns if she has it.
1613	Vince
1614	Shirley, Here it comes.
1614	Vince
1615	John, I am forwarding you a resume I have received today.
1615	The document has been distorted in transmission but it's still readable.
1615	Vince
1616	Anita, I can attend.
1616	Vince
1617	George, We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people in the first round.
1617	We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a bigger group.
1617	We would like to learn form experience how to run it.
1617	By the way, we had an option training for EES (roughly 150 people, over a few weeks).
1617	I can give you the materials and we can repeat it if you think it's useful.
1617	Vince
1618	Kevin, Let's meet for lunch next week (Monday of Friday would be best).
1618	We can talk about the project and decide who has the right skills to help you.
1618	The person who supports EBS is Stinson Gibner and his lead person is Martin Lin.
1618	My secretary's number is 3-5290 (Shirley Crenshaw).
1618	Vince
1619	Michael, I think that Keynes was right on the money.
1619	He had great insights into the forward markets.
1619	By the way, what are your thoughts about CA?
1619	Vince
1620	Jeff, A few comments on the model: 1.
1620	We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant.
1620	In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the details and in the inputs and calibration.
1620	The same model may produce drastically different results depending on the quality of inputs.
1620	2.
1620	We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research Group.
1620	We were told that you would provide an IT resource.
1620	Alex would supervise this person.

1632	The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were extremely busy and I could not focus on PSERC issues.
1632	I shall consult a few people in Enron on this subject and get in touch with you.
1632	Our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition.
1632	I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me.
1632	I would be glad to cover the cost of your Austin to Houston trip.
1632	Regarding your son.
1632	The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

1643	Hi, Christe Thanks.
1643	The objective of the meeting with Jeff Shankman is to use his powers of persuasion to make sure that John Arnold and Louise Kitchen can make presentations to the Tiger Team.
1643	We can also talk to them about getting some other people from their units to make presentations to the team.

1651	Molly, Sandeep Kohli called last night.
1651	We decided to transfer Anshuman for the 6-month trial period and then extend his assignment to a permanent employment if necessary.
1651	For Sandeep Kohli it's a permanent transfer, effective immediately.
1651	Some local opposition to poaching of good people.

1654	Martin, Please, ask Steve to call your office.
1654	I may be late on Friday.
1654	I don't have to be present at this conference call.
1654	Please, talk about your potential involvement and if takes a trip to London it's OK with me.
1654	Vince
1655	Christie, I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and Rice projects.
1655	By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is exactly the same as the project for Wharton.
1655	We shall see who is better.
1655	Their names are Li Sun and Kenneth Parkhill.
1655	Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings on Friday?
1655	Vince
1656	Steve, Thanks a lot.
1656	I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the code.
1656	Regarding Tanya's attitude.
1656	Just a few points.
1656	1.
1656	I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges.
1656	This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.
1656	It's not that the work is beneath her.
1656	2.
1656	Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston.
1656	He effectively told them to go away and work on the "research projects" and that he would take care of the IT issues.
1656	I don't think that it's just Tanya's issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.
1656	3.
1656	The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run.
1656	They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research.
1656	They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.
1656	The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that it happens.
1656	Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.
1656	Vince
1657	Pavel, We shall talk to him.
1657	He looks like a very qualified candidate.
1657	Vince
1658	Shirley, Please, set up a phone interview with him.

1666	I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday January 16, 3:30 p.m.
1666	at Jeff Shankman's office.
1666	We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 Wharton School students visiting Enron.
1666	A Wharton tiger team works through a semester on a special project, proposed by a corporation.
1666	The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the impact of electronic trading on the energy markets.
1666	The semester long project will result in a report that will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation.
1666	I hope that you will find this report useful.
1666	We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron.
1666	The students will arrive on Thursday, January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron.
1666	I would appreciate if you could find 30 minutes on Friday to talk to the students.
1666	The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

1702	See you in Austin and in Houston.
1702	Vince
1703	Molly, This is an update on Anshuman.
1703	Please, see below.
1703	It seems that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.
1703	We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here.
1703	Vince P.S.
1703	The relevant section.
1703	I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such a long time.
1703	However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.
1703	I will try to finalize that before I leave.
1703	I will call you in the evening to just chat.
1704	Molly, Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case.
1704	I am sure he will stay here for a while once he comes.
1704	It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him longer, given the priority of the project.
1704	I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.
1704	Thanks.
1704	Vince Enron North America Corp.
1705	Molly, I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
1705	I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project as a person delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston.
1705	To be absolutely above the line, I would still arrange the L1 visa.
1705	Vince Enron North America Corp.

1709	What about Paulo?
1709	Vince
1710	Norma, It seems that there is a bug in the system.
1710	I made an error mixing equity and merit raises in one column.
1710	The system does not allow me to correct the mistake by moving the entries from one column to another.
1710	I can enter the changes, but after I save them the system reverts to original designations.
1710	As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity raises.
1710	The column totals are misleading.
1710	I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.
1710	I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).
1710	Vince
1711	Molly, Thanks.
1711	Let's wait for Sandeep: he comes back Wednesday.

1715	Marc, Thanks for the invitation.
1715	I shall attend.
1715	Vince Kaminski Enron
1716	Norma, I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed merit and equity increases.
1716	I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
1716	The equity increases address two issues: retention and and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).
1716	Please, let me know if there are any questions.
1716	I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.

1719	I shall call you during the next few days.
1719	Vince
1720	Steve, Please, let me know when you come back.
1720	I have detected a tendency to implement different approaches to valuation in the past.
1720	To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques which, in turn, reflects, the turf wars and the desire by the originators to control the outcomes.
1720	Vince
1721	No problem.
1721	Vince
1722	Kathy, What is EMBANET?
1722	Do I have access from the outside?

1725	Steve, Vince
1726	Debbie, This is an update on the continuing Winston saga.
1726	Tanya identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies but the rest is in the Winston's hands.
1726	Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first approach to the problem.
1726	Privately, my concern is that the code, based on Tanya's report to me, leaves a lot to be desired.
1726	The code tends to be a very mechanical implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to optimize it.
1726	Let's keep paddling along.
1726	Vince
1727	Steve, I was delayed on my wait out.
1727	I probably hit the stop at Let me buy you a coffee this afternoon.
1727	What about 2:00?
1727	Vince
1728	Steve, Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward.
1728	My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full picture.
1728	Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no control long-term.
1728	I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules for the Research sign-off.
1728	Vince
1729	FYI Vince

1742	Neil, I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
1742	We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep every few days).
1742	Currently, we expect Anshuman to come to Houston for one month to work on the DPC project (at Jeff Shankman's request).
1742	The lawyers advised me that we need an L1 visa for him, irrespective of the duration of his stay.
1742	Sorry for the confusion.

1743	When she comes back, I shall ask her to start the process regarding a formal offer for you.

1897	Barbara, I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not offered under the umbrella of the seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a closed meeting for the School faculty.

1897	He is OK with this.
1897	You can let his program director know that I have explained to Vlady that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be invited.

1910	I had to cancel my presentation at San Antonio.
1910	Vince Shirley, Please, send a copy of the article to Hari.

1919	Vince
1920	I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and find that practically all the topics of the program are the staple of what we do every day.
1920	I don't think Research should spend money for this class.
1920	If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it by asking him to work on a research project.
1920	Vince
1921	Should we make arrangements for lunch?
1921	What about inviting Brad Romine: he was instrumental in forming this relationship?
1921	Vince Shirley, please include on my calendar.

1930	Please, give me some time to find out if I can work around this issue.
1930	Vince

1938	It looks for a file on my C: drive.
1938	Vince
1939	Rebecca, I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud.
1939	He is retired and he chose to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
1939	I understand that things are done differently in different cultures but I did not meet him and could not form my judgment based on personal observations.
1939	However, the information he gave us seems to be too important not to convey to you and not to act upon.
1939	Vince Kaminski
1940	Anita, Done.

1951	Jeff, I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston.
1951	I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next two years until all the business problems are successfully resolved.
1951	Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to attack the Dhabol modeling challenge.
1951	He understands the Indian markets as well as international fuel markets.
1951	He has also a very good grasp of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power plant.
1951	Vince
1952	Norma, I would like to proceed on two fronts with Sevile (both H1 visa and the Green Card. I shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements. They can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them. Vince

1973	Vince
1974	Greg, Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.
1974	1.
1974	Joe Carson.
1974	I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
1974	Enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and experience.
1974	He has many contacts in the industry and can represent Enron well.
1974	He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old shoulders.
1974	One negative is that he wants to work out of New York.
1974	The tradeoff is between maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks.
1974	2.
1974	Tony Mends.
1974	I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of using the skills of Tony Mends.
1974	Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased.
1974	I think that he is a very smart and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that relies on processing huge volumes of information.
1974	Vince
1975	Jim, Thanks a lot.
1975	Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.

1983	Vince
1984	Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
1984	I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.
1984	The problem is not with the lawyers.
1984	We worked on our presentation materials together with a professor from another university and we agreed to use these materials only internally.
1984	We have to honor our commitment to him.
1984	I am sure that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had made a similar commitment to you.
1984	Vince
1985	David, I shall be in the office tomorrow (Fri) afternoon.
1985	I am working with Maureen here to get some ammunition regarding the Korean economic conditions and prospects.
1985	Vince
1986	The answer to the 1st question is yes.
1986	The project list is fine with me and is still valid.
1986	We are an organization driven by the needs of our internal customers.
1986	I shall froward your message to the person in EBS.

2037	Vince
2038	Chris, E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather group.
2038	Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense for Research to charge his expenses to Global Markets.
2038	We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to different sub-units of GM.
2038	Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London with Mike Roberts.
2038	We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

2049	I have approved Iris' request for SPSS (reluctantly).
2049	It makes sense for her to use SPSS when she works for London (it would require more effort to move data bet the systems than the cost of SPSS).
2049	I don't like proliferation of systems, however.

2084	Vince
2085	FYI Vince
2086	David, During today's VaR coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.
2086	Mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory.
2086	Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves.
2086	We have agreed on the following: 1.
2086	Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves.
2086	He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.
2086	2.
2086	The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations).
2086	It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates.
2086	3.
2086	The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
2086	This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible).
2086	Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.
2086	Vince
2087	This is the list of projects for the members of the "quant" team.

2092	Jim, CHARM looks more like a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a production tool.
2092	We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has) in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB.
2092	Rick worked on a similar model at his old company and wanted to have a similar tool for his projects with Enron.
2092	I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later this week.
2092	I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can consider it as commercial product.

2148	Vince
2149	Steve, I submitted my evaluation.
2149	General impression was rather negative: he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth and technical details.
2149	He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive side.
2149	Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after 18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.
2149	Vince
2150	FYI Vince

2249	As I have said, we are not the decision makers in this case.

2264	Michelle, The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker, 5-3487.
2264	Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.
2264	I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable time.
2264	Vince
2265	Phillip, How can I install new programs on my laptop, without the administrator's privileges?
2265	One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail and to communicate with the office.
2265	Windows 2000 does not allow me to install it.
2265	Also, I have my private statistical software I often use when I work at night during business trips.

2282	Thanks Vince P.S.
2282	Shirley, please send my bio to Layla
2283	Anne, Thanks for contacting me about this.
2283	As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.
2283	I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1.
2283	The compensation would be her current base plus 10K.
2283	This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager.
2283	Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).
2283	On unrelated and more serious matter.
2283	Gary Hickerson is the primary client for Maureen's services.
2283	He communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution).
2283	This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.
2283	Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge.
2283	Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget.
2283	I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.
2283	Vince
2284	Gwyn, Yes, please go ahead and get a resume book from SAIS.

2353	S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily.
2353	Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index.
2353	Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across different rating categories and subsectors.
2353	Re-balancing occurs regularly to ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient liquidity.
2353	Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities is derived from a number of sources.

2359	Wade, I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation.
2359	You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.
2359	A brief outline of the facts.
2359	1.
2359	His wife is pregnant.
2359	She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy.
2359	Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child).
2359	Current pregnancy is also very complicated.
2359	2.
2359	Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife.
2359	The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit.
2359	The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.
2359	The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf.
2359	Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American society.
2359	I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department.
2359	I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach.
2359	It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.
2359	I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds.
2359	I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.
2359	Thanks.
2359	Vince
2360	Krishna, I have already sent the letter.
2360	Vince
2361	Christie, My movie picks for the weekend: 1.
2361	Kids will love these movies: Gods Must Be Crazy, La Chevre, Johnny Stecchino 2.
2361	More mature audience (OK for the kids): Diva, A Letter to Three Wives (classic, 1947) Enjoy Vince
2362	Ken, We called Tom Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to Enron.
2362	It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf.
2362	It's rather a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different problems of interest to potential customers.
2362	We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.
2362	They promised to get back to us in a few days.
2362	Vince
2363	Thanks Vince

2397	Jeff, Another indication of tensions in EC.
2397	Vince
2398	A few comments on the state of our VaR models.
2398	The issues always become more controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would like to share with you a few observations.
2398	1.
2398	Critical importance of a good risk management system to Enron (and the P/E ratio).
2398	A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors.
2398	One way to counter this crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and our strong risk amangeemnt culture.
2398	Our claims regarding the strong risk management technology and culture should be, however, supported by reality.
2398	It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors, credit rating agencies) about the quality of our financial technology.
2398	This can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.
2398	by reality.
2398	2.
2398	Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.
2398	The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to the market observations (as opposed to historical data).
2398	One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.
2398	One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the trading desks is perfect.
2398	One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices curves.
2398	The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized forward price volati;oty.
2398	If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will systematically fail.
2398	One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements.
2398	It will allow us to identify the source of problems we see in some books.
2398	3.
2398	VaR process management.
2398	Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory, a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.
2398	What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality of the results.
2398	Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility for the model calibration.
2398	Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research.
2398	As a result we have inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls.
2398	Some inputs used currently in the system are 2 years old.
2398	Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects.
2398	In my view some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal usefulness (and in some case on questionable understanding of mathematics).
2398	Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties and
2399	Dear Mr. Fink, I am sorry to decline the invitation due to prior commitments.

2416	Ron, Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going into the Raptor vehicles.
2416	We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project.
2416	We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
2416	This omission makes our valuation more conservative form the Enron's point of view.
2416	Please, let us know if this is required.
2416	Vince
2417	Shirley, Please, ask her to E-mail this to both you and me.
2417	Vince
2418	Mark, Thanks.
2418	I can always depend on a prompt response from you.
2418	Vince
2419	Mike, Please, take a look Vince
2420	Gary, He looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive hundreds of such resumes.
2420	The way to distinguish between different candidates is to ask the question: Did an individual make an effort and invested his time to learn things directly useful to Enron?
2420	Given our work load, I would not accept a person who has general quantitative skills but expects that Enron will train him from ground zero in all other disciplines.
2420	We had recently a candidate who wrote a letter and complained about being asked questions about energy economics, finance, etc. during an interview.
2420	We can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything beyond math.
2420	Vince
2421	Can you interview him over the phone?
2421	Vince
2422	Bob, Please, give me an advice.
2422	The students from Rice wrote a report about EOL from which we extracted this article.
2422	We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
2422	The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).
2422	Who else could help to review it?
2422	Vince
2423	Bjorn, I don't think the scope of the project is really that big.
2423	When we looked into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue.
2423	To me, it's really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be an equivalent of a Desert Storm operation.
2423	Zimin and I will call Slava on Tuesday and determine what has to be done.
2423	Vince
2424	We can sponsor one table.
2424	What do you think is the appropriate level of sponsorship?
2424	Vince
2425	Nelson, We can go to Memphis on Friday.
2425	I would discuss first with Gary and Elsa the scope of what we shall reveal.
2425	We can shoot ourselves in the foot if we reveal our pricing technology to consultants.
2425	Vince
2426	This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project produced.
2426	Of course, they were free to say what they thought.
2426	Our objective is to modify the article to such an extent that it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms in the energy industry.
2426	It would be only for internal consumption and it should be a useful source of information for Enron employees.
2426	Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.
2426	Vince
2427	We can sponsor a table at the FRIEND level.

2545	Swamped with work as usual.
2545	I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.
2545	The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in one night) but we survived without major problems.

2545	Vince

2616	My system needs a file in .doc or .pdf format.
2616	M/S Word or Acrobat.
2616	Vince
2617	Anne, No problem.
2617	I have retained Debra to offer a course for 20 persons in October.

2620	Vince
2621	Paolo, I cannot open the file.

2621	The file that I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension .pdf and begin with teh same string of characters.
2621	Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.
2621	My fax number is 713 646 2503.
2621	Vince
2622	Mike, Let's call Paul.
2622	I want to discuss this with him.
2622	Vince
2623	Billy, We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.
2623	He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not define it.
2623	An answer to any question was that he did work in a different area.
2623	When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would complain that the question is too detailed.
2623	He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).
2623	Vince
2624	FYI Vince
2625	Received Vince
2626	I shall be available next week, except for Friday.
2626	Vince
2627	Mark, Thanks a lot.
2627	Looks really interesting.
2627	Vince
2628	Paul, I am glad you sent me this message.
2628	It will help to clarify a few issues.
2628	1.
2628	I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process) last Friday, as far as I can remember.
2628	Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group.
2628	I told him two things: a.
2628	We would be delighted to have him here.
2628	b.
2628	Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives your blessing before we can move ahead.
2628	We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and Mike Roberts.
2628	2.
2628	Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian.
2628	Mike and I decided to call you anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter.
2628	I was in a PRC all afternoon and asked Mike to call you in case I could not sneak out to join him.
2628	Mike called and was told you were out sick.
2628	3.
2628	I am leaving in a few hours for California.
2628	I shall be driving back to Houston for the next 3 days.
2628	Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with him in my absence.
2628	4.
2628	I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to Houston.
2628	I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July.
2628	I did not bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
2628	I can understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account.
2628	But the first issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
2628	I hope it helps.
2628	Cheers.
2628	Vince
2629	Mark, The members of my group attend INFORMS conferences and I shall check today if we are covering this specific meeting.
2629	We shall be glad to speak with Dr. O'Hara when he comes to Houston.
2629	I shall be gone on Friday, but you can contact Sandeep Kohli in Houston to discuss the details.
2629	Any date in the time interval given by you works for us.
2629	Vince
2630	Kevin, Thanks.
2630	Vince
2631	This is Dr. Ueneohara.
2631	The spellchecker has done it for me.
2631	Sorry.
2631	Please, make sure that I am involved in the meeting.
2631	Also, include Bob Lee, Rakesh, Vasant, Zimin, Krishna, Paulo, Alex, Tanya, Rabi.
2631	Vince
2632	FYI Vince
2633	It's done.
2633	Please, check.
2633	Vince
2634	Les, I shall try to send you my comments later today.
2634	Our address is 1400 Smith (2 blocks from Hyatt Regency Downtown and Doubletree Downtown).
2634	The phone number is 713 853 3848 and my assistant's extension is 713 853 5290 (Shirley Crenshaw).
2634	Look fwd to meeting you.
2634	Vince
2635	Gina, I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only" lunch.
2635	I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati, who studies Italian on his own.
2635	What about Tuesday next week?
2635	Vince
2636	Paul, I hope you feel better.
2636	I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed that he approached the Research in Houston on his own.
2636	He did not receive any encouragement from me and from Mike.
2636	I hope this closes this issue.
2636	I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
2636	He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers who have similar backgrounds.
2636	I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.
2636	My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social intelligence.
2636	Vince
2637	Laura, We can definitely help Jose.
2637	We are producing the demand projections for natural gas by state, by customer class every day.
2637	The projections are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very good history of hitting the right number.
2637	This validate svery well the demand model.
2637	Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas available in the short run.
2637	We have some good insights into this problem as well.
2637	My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
2637	I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures to keep them away from critical information.
2637	Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.
2637	I am ready to help you with baseball.
2637	I went to a game last week and Astros won.
2637	I guess I brought some good Karma.
2637	Vince
2638	Krishna, Who can review Rusty?
2638	I think he deserves an offer.
2638	Vince
2639	Shirley, Please, keep an eye on this event to make sure we don't drop the ball for Rusty.
2639	Vince
2640	Krishna, Resending just in case.
2640	Who can review Rusty?
2640	Vince
2641	Do you have a formal presentation about your company and the services you offer?
2641	Any web site?
2641	I would like to pass on the information I received fro Jurek Jarosz but I need something more tangible to start the process.
2641	Vince Kaminski Enron
2642	Shirley, Please set up a lunch meeting with Mike Roberts and myself and Jose Molina (please, see below) next week.
2642	We can meet over sandwiches.
2642	Vince
2643	Mike, I asked Shirley to set up a meeting over sandwiches with Jose Molina (please, see below).
2643	Vince
2644	Michael, The person who can help you is Zimin Lu.
2644	Due to the death in his family, he will be unavailable in the next few days.
2644	Please, work directly with me to coordinate the project.
2644	We can meet tomorrow (Tuesday or Wednesday) for 15 minutes to discuss the details.
2644	Vince
2645	It think he deserves an offer.
2645	Can you write an evaluation for him?
2645	Vince
2646	Mike, Can we help this guy?
2646	Vince
2647	Alex, I could not open the attachment.
2647	Please, send it as a MS Word document or a .pdf file.
2647	Vince
2648	Pilar, I will attend.
2648	Vince Kaminski
2649	Claudio, The weather bond project looks like a well - defined project.
2649	It should result in an interesting term paper.
2649	Vince
2650	I shall attend the Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. Vince Kaminski
2651	FYI Vince
2652	Shirley Please, set up a phone interview with this guy.
2652	The usual suspects: Zimin, Alex, Bob.
2652	Vince
2653	Michael, 3:30 today works for me.
2653	We can meet at EB1938 for about half an hour.
2653	I shall introduce you to my associate who will work on the project.
2653	Vince
2654	Alex, Thanks a lot.
2654	I could open our resume.
2654	We hire part-time employees to help us with our weather effort: the work is concentrated in the early morning hours I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group about our needs.
2654	Please, let me know if you are interested in a summer internship in 2002.
2654	The decisions are made in late January and February and you should let me know by then.
2654	Vince
2655	Please, ask them if they can accept our invitation to lunch following the meeting?
2655	Vince
2656	Alex, Thanks.
2656	I think it's a low risk proposition.
2656	He is just an associate.
2656	Vince
2657	Chris, I read your paper with great interest.
2657	I shall be glad to give you my comments.
2657	Please, feel free to call me at 713 853 3848.
2657	Vince
2658	Thanks for your message.
2658	Confirmed.
2658	Vince
2659	Bob, FYI Vince
2660	Gina, It's a deal.
2660	Vince
2661	Chris, 2:00 p.m.
2661	on Wednesday this week is fine with me.
2661	Look forward to talking to you.

2663	Alex, Yes, please go ahead.
2663	Vince
2664	Eric, Thanks.
2664	Vince
2665	John, Would you like me to use the slides you attached or expand/replace them with some additional material.
2665	Vince
2666	It would help to have a presentation to start the discussion.
2666	We can wait till September.
2666	Vince
2667	John, I shall expand your slides by adding a few more.
2667	I shall rely on your judgment: you know better what is the level of sophistication of the students.
2667	See you tomorrow.
2667	Vince
2668	FYI Vince
2669	Mike, Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit.
2669	I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed.
2669	Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.
2669	Another observation.
2669	I have just talked to Christian and suggested a conference call Monday evening our time with Paul.
2669	You can mention this conference call request to Paul.
2669	The oservation: Christian may be smart but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality.
2669	Vince
2670	Steve, Yes, They are coming.
2670	It makes sense for Shirley to confirm it on Friday for you (I shall be in Dallas) before you hop on the plane.
2670	The meeting start at 9:00 at the Greg's office.
2670	Hope to see you on Monday.
2670	Vince
2671	Steve, No problem.
2671	I shall be glad to give you an endorsement.
2671	I am meeting Pravven Kumar in a few days and will mention your name.
2671	Let's mmet fordinner later i August.
2671	I shall talk to Mike about it.

2673	Vince Kaminski
2674	Kristin, Excellent reporting on California.

2686	Vince
2687	Any interest in James?
2687	Vince
2688	Rick, Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak at this conference?
2688	Our friends at UT were very disappointed last time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.
2688	Vince
2689	Thanks.
2689	I shall get in touch with Mike and the Analyst /Associate program.
2689	Vince
2690	Billy, I received a request to make a presentation to the Energy Finance class at UT this fall.
2690	It makes sensed to coordinate my trip with your unit presentation to the MBA students at the UT.
2690	Please, let me know who is the person to coordinate this request with?
2690	Vince
2691	Christie, I will attend.
2691	Vince
2692	FYI Vince
2693	Thanks I will attend Vince Kaminski
2694	Kim, I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages) and he mentioned an interview with you.
2694	He is a very bright and capable individual and he would be a good fit to your group.
2694	Vince P.S.
2694	He looks better without the pony tail.
2695	Dear Dr. Uenohara, I would like to thank once more you and your colleagues for visiting Enron and for your most interesting presentation.
2695	We all look forward to working with you in the future.
2695	Vince Kaminski
2696	Thanks Here is the message for Jeff: Jeff, I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin.
2696	The conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002.
2696	Depending on your calendar, the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner (February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).
2696	This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business.
2696	The topics covered in the past meetings included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management and the future of deregulation.
2696	The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda for the 2002 event is under development.
2696	Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation will benefit the company.
2696	The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the agenda for the future.
2696	Vince Kaminski
2697	Kim, Thanks.
2697	I shall ask Shirley to schedule a lunch in 2-3 weeks for me and Krishna with you.
2697	Krishna is about to become a Daddy again in a few days; the end of August should work for him.
2697	Vince
2698	I shall attend East Power presentation as well.
2698	Vince
2699	Thanks.
2699	I think dinner is a better forum for Jeff.
2699	Vince
2700	Jeff agreed to participate.
2700	I suggested dinner as a better forum to Jeff's secretary.
2700	The decision regarding lunch/dinner issue is still to be made.
2700	Vince
2701	Steve, Praveen is coming in tomorrow.
2701	We shall figure out a way to give you a great recommendation.
2701	I always appreciate your trading suggestions.
2701	Vince
2702	Steve, Two things.
2702	1.
2702	Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
2702	I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but want to make sure I did not miss any important point.
2702	2.
2702	Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship, how would you like to be involved?
2702	Out of London or, possibly, Houston?
2702	Please, let me know.
2702	Vince
2703	Mike, This is what some people in the industry see.
2703	Vince
2704	Sheridan, I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call about this.
2704	I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at San Antonio.
2704	Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.
2704	Internal Enron perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area, regarding valuation of investment projects.
2704	Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values.
2704	It will help if I get the agenda of the conference soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling.
2704	It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him.
2704	Vince
2705	Norman, Thanks.
2705	Talk to you soon.
2705	Vince
2706	Thanks Vince
2707	Steve, Prediction Company was confused.
2707	No problem - I got the outline from memory and I shall cc you.
2707	I shall attach your minutes to my memo for Greg.
2707	Vince
2708	Alex, It probably makes sense to wait a few months to see if you really like Dynegy.
2708	We can meet for lunch anyway sometimes in the next few weeks.
2708	Please, call me at Vince
2709	Bob, Any interest?
2709	Vince
2710	FYI Vince
2711	Pam, Thanks for your message.
2711	I have forwarded the resume to the members of my group who use part-time employees.
2711	Vince
2712	Frank, Greg Whalley and I are planning another trip to a California.
2712	The trip is most likely to take place on the 16th - 17th of August or a week later (23rd - 24th of August).
2712	Are you available for an afternoon meeting and / or dinner on Thursday, August 16 or August 23?
2712	We are very interested in your thoughts about the directions of the power markets across the US.
2712	Vince Kaminski
2713	Christie, Thanks.
2713	I shall attend.
2713	Another quick questions.
2713	Art Varga and Praveen Kumar have been talking to us asking for directions regarding their energy program.
2713	I have suggested they should contact you as well.
2713	Please, include me in the meeting: I want to stay close to them as we are trying to place a number of our employees in their PH.D.
2713	program.
2713	Vince
2714	Shirley, Vince
2715	Frank, I looked at your resume.
2715	There is no good fit with my group.
2715	I have forwarded your resume to 2 different units of Enron (Enron Industrial Markets) and Enron Networks.
2715	They may be interested in your skills.
2715	Vince Kaminski
2716	Any interest?
2716	I got this resume today from a person I never met.
2716	It seems he may have some relevant skills.
2716	Vince
2717	Hi Presly, Thanks for the message.
2717	Things have slowed down for me and it's time to enjoy the summer.
2717	I wander if you have heard from Enron's HR people?
2717	Talk to you soon.
2717	Vince
2718	Julie, No problem.
2718	Vince
2719	Lexi, Looks great.
2719	Vince
2720	Bob, Please, go ahead and register.
2720	Vince
2721	Hi Presly, I shall check with my PR person about your resume and will give you a call.
2721	Vince
2722	Thanks Vince
2723	Liz, Greg: Frank Wolak from Stanford will be back in the office on Tuesday, August 7.
2723	I hope to set up a meeting with him and then to finalize the meeting with Prediction Co. I shall be shooting for August 23 - 24, in view of Greg's trip on the 15th and 16th.
2723	I left a message for Norman Packard, telling him that I should be able to get back to him regarding the trip to Santa Fe by Tuesday this week.
2723	The first draft of the non-disclosure agreement will be ready by Tuesday or Wednesday.
2723	Have a good trip.
2723	Vince
2724	Liz, Frank Wolak can meet Greg and me in his office and for dinner Thursday night, August 16, at Stanford.
2724	Can Greg fly to San Francisco or San Jose from his Asset Tour trip in late afternoon on that day?
2724	If Greg can get a co plane to go San Francisco on Thursday, we could fly together to Santa Fe on Friday morning, August 17.
2724	Norman Packard can meet us on that day.
2724	I could go to San Francisco Thursday morning on a commercial flight.
2724	Vince
2725	Kevin, Ed is running a consulting firm in Boston that often tries to act as a boutique merchant bank.
2725	He inquired if Enron could provide transmission hedges for the Neptune project.
2725	Any interest.
2725	Please, feel free to contact Ed directly and let me know.
2725	Vince
2726	Who is the trader that might be interested in this project?
2726	I have already forwarded the message to Kevin Presto.
2726	Vince
2727	Ed, Thanks for your message.
2727	I have forwarded the message to the head of our power trading desk and to our transmission group.
2727	Hope to hear form them later today.
2727	Vince
2728	Tom FYI.
2728	I have forwarded this message to Kevin Presto as well.
2728	Vince
2729	Bob, Do you have a standard presentation on Enron's role in creating and growing the spot and forward markets for pulp and paper?
2729	We are helping the media group to make a pitch to a big customer ($40 billion in revenues) and we would like to provide some examples of our skills in creating and growing new markets.
2729	Vince P.S.
2729	It's quite urgent: we were asked to help at the eleventh hour.
2730	Thanks for a very quick turn around.
2730	Vince
2731	Norman, Thanks for your message.
2731	Still struggling with a trip schedule, trying to reconcile many different itineraries.
2731	I should connect with Greg who is in London and firm the plans up by tomorrow morning.
2731	I am attaching a draft of a non-disclosure agreement.
2731	Please, take a look at it at your leisure and let me now what you think.
2731	I have also FedExed you some reading materials about the power and natural gas prices.
2731	Vince
2732	Please, try to mobilize the members of the group who have not made a contribution yet.
2732	Research is shown as a separate group in all the reports and we may stand out as unit at the end of this week.
2732	Vince
2733	Mike, We discussed United Way last Thursday when you were on the 32nd floor monitoring the hurricane.
2733	Vince
2734	Anne, Thanks for your quick action on Prasanna.
2734	He came to us looking for a transfer.
2734	I was reluctant to do it in the first place, because we try to avoid poaching other groups.
2734	Given that his reviews are less than enthusiastic, we shall write him off.
2734	Vince
2735	Vince
2736	Vince
2737	Shawn, Let's do lunch.
2737	It's long overdue.
2737	we have been planning it for a long time.
2737	Vince
2738	We crossed the 50% participation mark.
2738	Vince
2739	Congratulations.
2739	Vince
2740	Marc, We already have a basket option model that we can adapt for this transaction.
2740	I shall talk with Sandeep and Vasant about it.
2740	Vince
2741	I will attend.
2741	Vince Kaminski
2742	Hello John, Thanks for the lead.
2742	I have seen other papers on this topic.
2742	Vince
2743	Liz, FYI.
2743	Can we firm up either date?
2743	I am getting the impression they are getting impatient.
2743	Vince
2744	FYI Vince
2745	Gwyn, Congratulations.
2745	Vince
2746	Sheridan, I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will mention the valuation seminar.
2746	I shall ask Rick how many employees from his group he would send to this program.
2746	I have no suggestions regarding the program, except that the last year selection of topics was very interesting.
2746	You can include e-bus and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.
2746	My address is: 1400 Smith Room EB1962 Vince
2747	Mike, Great idea.
2747	My son built his own computer.
2747	He can help.
2747	Also, we are meeting Greg for 10 mins on Monday.
2747	Vince
2748	Norman, My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.
2748	Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in Northern England.
2748	The accident coincided with Greg's trip to London and Greg got immersed in all the problems related to it.
2748	I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back to Houston.
2748	Vince
2749	Terry 281-296-0573
2750	Eric, Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not contributed so far?
2750	I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/ interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
2750	I think our participation may a bit higher.
2750	Vince
2751	FYI, We need to get to at least 80%.
2751	I am also talking to Erik Thode: I am afraid he has a list of the group distorted by the summer employees who cannot contribute even if they want to (they are not in the system).
2751	Vince
2752	Thanks.
2752	FYI.
2752	Our internal RAC models assign roughly BB credit rating to Enron.
2752	Vince
2753	Hello, Thanks for your message.
2753	I think that we can resume our discussions in a few months.
2753	We have currently a large group of highly skilled Enron employees who, given that we have effectively an internal labor market, are looking for alternative positions.
2753	We are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions.
2753	Vince
2754	Thanks.
2754	Vince
2755	Nelson, I fully agree.
2755	They are free to donate as much as they want to charity as they wish, but it does not have to be through Enron.
2755	Vince
2756	Hello Chris, Thanks for your message.
2756	The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on a spark spread option.
2756	A few comments.
2756	1.
2756	A spark spread model has two primary uses.
2756	It can be used for pricing stand alone options traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation model of a generation plant.
2757	Test
2758	Managing Energy Risk Price, Risk Magazine Books, 2nd edition Clewlow, Strickland, Energy Derivatives
2759	Eric, Oren Zimmerman ( # 19) resigned and should be removed from the list.
2759	Numbers 15 & 12 are part-time employees, a high school and college students, respectively, and we should not consider them in the total as well.
2759	Vince
2760	FYI Vince
2761	Tom, Lance, Martin, This meeting is regarding Brazil and hydro conditions in this country.
2761	Let's meet Wednesday to talk about the ways we can contribute to solving this problem.
2761	Tom, where do we stand with SDDP?
2761	Vince
2762	Joe, I can bring to the meeting some members of my group who support power modeling and have experience with hydro systems and transmission.
2762	Do you want me to include them in the meting?
2762	I understand it's about Brazil.
2762	Vince
2763	Yes, they are in the acquisition mode.
2763	I think the stock will do OK long-term.
2763	Vince
2764	Diane, I will have it for you shortly.
2764	Vince
2765	Hello Christie, It makes sense to invite somebody from EIM (Ray Bowen?) to the luncheon.
2765	By the way, what is the location?

2766	FYI Vince
2767	Martin, Tom, Can you join me at the meeting with Joe Kishkil on Thu, 1:00 p.m.

2769	Diane, This is the headcount projection for 2002.
2769	I am slightly above my plan for 2001 that I am under performing now.
2769	Sorry for the delay.
2769	Vince
2770	Shirley, Please, let's review it and see if any re-class is involved.
2770	Vince
2771	Norman, Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
2771	The trip this week, August 17, is impossible.
2771	As you know by now, our CEO, Jeff Skilling, resigned today and Greg will be tied up in analyst calls for the next few days.
2771	We still hope to be able to visit you on the 24th, as long as you are still available on this day.
2771	Just in case, please advise me about you availability on Friday, August 31st.
2771	Vince
2772	Frank, Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
2772	As you can imagine, after Jeff Skilling's resignation, Greg Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.
2772	We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.
2772	Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks.
2772	Hopefully, we can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.
2772	Vince
2773	Scott, Thanks for the message.
2773	I have talked to HR today and they will be contacting you regarding the offer.
2773	We shall work out the details this week.
2773	Of course, we have to go through our usual procedures and I leave it to our HR department.
2773	Vince
2774	Great.
2774	A big jump in participation.
2774	Vince
2775	FYI Vince
2776	Liz, FYI.
2776	This is the person at Stanford Greg would like to meet.
2776	Vince
2777	Hi Joe, I called you Tuesday and left a message on your voice mail.
2777	Jeff's address is: jeff.skilling@enron.com Vince
2778	Liz, An update on Frank's availability at Stanford.
2778	Vince
2779	Osman, Here it is.
2779	Sorry for the delay.
2779	Vince
2780	Liz, What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
2780	Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.
2780	We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before.
2780	Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA.
2780	Can you ask Greg if he wants to participate in the conference call?
2780	I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m.
2780	our time, for a conference call.
2780	Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer, Mark Taylor, as well.
2780	Vince
2781	Anne, Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate.
2781	This entry was reversed later.
2781	Any reason for that?
2781	It may be related to his transfer from EBS.
2781	We can check with his previous business unit whether they gave /promised him a promotion.
2781	Vince
2782	Liz, We can schedule the trip sometimes between September the 3rd and September the 5th.
2782	I was shooting for Friday only because it worked better for Greg.
2782	Vince
2783	Brian, It sounds great.
2783	I know from personal experience that it's much better to da new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectaIf you don't manage the management, they will give you zero credit for the idea, and a lot of grief for slow deployment.
2783	I see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade powerIs it OK to consult one my associates (Martin Lin) and ask him for his opinion?
2783	He knows infinitely more about transmission than I do.
2783	A lunch / dinner at a Sardinian restaurant would be great.
2783	I spent a summer in Sardinia in 1970.
2783	Vince
2784	Anne, Thanks for a very quick (as always) reaction.
2784	I want to ask you for another favor.
2784	Can you send me the list, for my files, of promotions after the last PRC?
2784	Vince
2785	Martin, Any thoughts on this project?
2785	Vince
2786	John, I will teach the option class in the spring (starting sometimes in February).
2786	I don't see any problem if you want to audit the class.
2786	Vince
2787	Jim, What about 2 p.m., my time, on Friday, August 17.
2787	If this works for you, I shall try to invite a lawyer who wrote the draft of the non-disclosure agreement.
2787	Vince
2788	Brian, Another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.
2788	As you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage.
2788	About 95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of water in the reservoirs is about 20% of the normal.
2788	We have a huge exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.
2788	Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil are asking for help.
2788	We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections.
2788	These objections may not apply to Brazil.
2788	Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from Sao Paulo to discuss the problem?
2788	He will be back in his office on Tuesday .
2788	I shall call you tomorrow about it.
2788	What is your phone number?
2788	Vince
2789	Marshall, Thanks.
2789	My assistant will call him to confirm.
2789	Vince
2790	Kevin, Thanks.
2790	Vince
2791	Brian, Thanks.
2791	I shall ask Shirley to set up a conference call with Remy on Tuesday.
2791	You can come up to the 19th floor if you wish.
2791	I shall ask Martin Lin to join us well.
2791	Vince
2792	Eric, FYI Vince
2793	Nelson, Thanks.
2793	Vince
2794	Brian, FYI Vince
2795	Laura, Sorry for a delay in responding to your previous message.
2795	My boss, Greg Whalley will be traveling a lot during the next 2 weeks, visiting different offices of Enron.
2795	It seems at this point that we may be able to visit you in Santa Fe in the first part of the week of September the 3rd.
2795	Please, advise me of your availability.
2795	I apologize for our inability to commit to a firm date at this point.
2795	I would like to assure you of our continuing interest in working with you in the future.
2795	Vince
2796	Jim, Confirmed.
2796	Vince
2797	Billy, I have received an invitation to speak to a graduating class of the Quantitative and Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech.
2797	The URL is included in the message below.
2797	Would you be interested in arranging for a presentation at this school about the A/A Program, coinciding with my visit?
2797	Vince
2798	Tom, Select on of the courses.
2798	Hard to say which one is the best.
2798	Vince
2799	I consider attending a course you are teaching.
2799	Can you, please, send me an electronic version of the booklet "Introduction to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Third Edition" Vince Kaminski Managing Director Enron Corp.
2800	Dear Mr. de la Fuente, I appreciate the invitation to the conference on Ten Years of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring.
2800	I shall be able to make a decision next week.
2800	Vince Kamnski
2801	Tanya, Can you help this guy?
2801	Vince
2802	Jim, I shall call you from my office OK?
2802	Vince
2803	Dear Samantha, My associate, Steve Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.
2803	I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and about the contribution Enron could make.
2803	You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, "Managing Energy Price Risk", 2nd edition.
2803	This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published so far.
2803	It is a good starting point to a conversation about different options you might consider.
2803	Please, feel free to give me a call.
2803	My direct number is 713 853 3848.
2803	Vince Kaminski
2804	Billy, Your recommendation makes sense.
2804	It's a new program and we have no data points about its quality.
2804	I shall inform my contact that you have already fully committed your resources and cannot make anymore campus trips.
2804	I shall offer to collect the resumes and distribute them within Enron.
2804	Vince
2805	Brian, Talk to Marge Nadasky.
2805	She can get a discount of 15% for an Enron employee.
2805	Vince
2806	Sam, Looks great.
2806	Plz, go ahead as soon as the equations are in. Vince
2807	FYI Vince
2808	Patrick, Thank you.
2808	I have forwarded the resume to my friend at AIG.
2808	Vince
2809	Traci, Thanks.
2809	Vince
2810	FYI Vince
2811	Sally, We were approached a few months ago regarding this benchmarking study.
2811	You and I decided jointly against Enron's involvement in this project.
2811	They have approached us again.
2811	Any thoughts?
2811	Vince
2812	Theresa, I have forwarded this message to a number of executives at Enron and we shall meet to discuss this project.
2812	Vince
2813	Mike, Take a look at the comment on AGA.
2813	Vince
2814	Shirley, I would like to commit to October 4.
2814	Any other engagement?
2814	Vince
2815	Shirley, No. Vince
2816	Did I talk to you about it?
2816	Vince
2817	Hello Tricia, It was nice to hear from you.
2817	What are your coordinates?
2817	Vince
2818	Joe, We are in process of setting up a phone interview with him.
2818	Vince
2819	Shirley, Can you set up a phone interview with him.
2819	Vince
2820	FYI Vince
2821	Joe, Jeff It seems MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction.
2821	I think it re Joe, Jeff It's interesting MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction.
2821	I think it reflects their ability to hedge.
2821	Any other thoughts?
2821	Vince
2822	FYI Vince
2823	Johnny Thanks.
2823	Please, set up an interview in cooperation with Shirley Crenshaw, Vince
2824	Tanya No problem.
2824	Vince
2825	Visit, Please, send me your address and I shall send you a reprint.
2825	Vince
2826	Makes sense.
2826	Let's meet with Gordon.
2826	I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting.
2826	Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?
2826	I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's liquidity at some point.
2826	Vince
2827	Karen, I shall forward the message to number of my friends with an experience and contacts in the industry.
2827	They may be able to give you some leads.
2827	Vince
2828	Molly, Jill is a daughter of my friend.
2828	She contacted our Analyst/Associate Program but her background makes her a better candidate for an HR position.
2828	Do you know if we are looking for somebody with her skills?
2828	Vince
2829	Let's send flowers.
2829	I don't think a transfer is an issue that should be brought up during a hospital visit.
2829	Zhiyong does not need any more stress (I speak from experience - I had a car accident).
2829	Vince
2830	Anne, Thanks.
2830	I shall give you the review forms by Friday.
2830	Also, I did cc you on a msg re my friend's daughter resume.
2830	She is looking for an HR position.
2830	Do you see any need in your department?
2830	Vince
2831	Anne, Yes, I got the forms.
2831	It remains to be seen when I talk to Greg about it.
2831	Vince
2832	Cassandra, We can wait till Rudi comes back an then we can meet.
2832	I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting with you and Rudi and Gordon next week.
2832	Vince
2833	HC stands for ...?
2833	Vince
2834	Any comments on this person?
2834	Vince
2835	Sean, This was exactly the advice I gave to Zimin this morning.
2835	Vince
2836	Adrianne, Thanks Vince
2837	Paolo, I should finish the review in a day or two.
2837	We were quite busy here in Enron for the last few days.
2837	Vince
2838	Jonathan, Thanks.
2838	Vince
2839	Therese, Done.
2839	Please check.
2839	Vince
2840	Nelson, Thanks for you effort.
2840	Vince
2841	Laura, Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe would be Wednesday, September the 5th.
2841	WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning and we could stay through the day.
2841	Please, let me know if this date would work for you.
2841	Vince
2842	Frank, Thanks for your message.
2842	What about a meeting on Tuesday, September the 4th.
2842	We could meet at your office, let's say at 4 p.m.
2842	We would be delighted if you could join us for dinner later in the evening on the same day.
2842	Vince
2843	FYI.
2843	The first leg of the trip has been confirmed.
2843	Vince.
2844	FYI Vince
2845	Liz, It's in Stanford.
2845	We can stay at the Stanford Inn Hotel Tuesday night and leave early in the morning for Santa Fe on Wednesday.
2845	I am still waiting for Prediction to confirm their meeting on Wednesday.
2845	Vince
2846	Gina, Tuesday, August 28 looks good.
2846	Vince
2847	Paul, Thanks for your message.
2847	Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years with the company.
2847	The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586 I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you.
2847	Can you indicate the subject of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?
2847	Vince
2848	Richard, It's nice to hear for you.
2848	I know many people at Rice, including the Dean of the Business School, and I can make discreet inquiries on your behalf.
2848	Please, let me know if I can approach the Dean or one of the finance faculty members on your behalf.
2848	Vince
2849	Joe, We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project).
2849	We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present our findings about pricing and hedging.
2849	We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over the phone.
2849	Vince P.S.
2849	You are right.
2849	The margins are fat.
2849	It looks like a great opportunity.
2850	Joe, I sent you another msg about our work on JCC.
2850	We are meeting Marc de la Roche tomorrow to discuss the JCC projects.
2850	Who is the person in Tokyo we should work with on this project?
2850	Vince
2851	Steve, I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their Energy Club.
2851	I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one of his associates.
2851	Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.
2851	Vince
2852	Joe, We shall work with Marc and Kinoshita to get it done.
2852	Also, we talked to Kiyoshi today and were very impressed.
2852	We shall show his resume to Whalley.
2852	Vince
2853	John, A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group.
2853	I understand the new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.
2853	My recommendation is against it.
2853	If the objective of having two separate weather groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views, the new seating arrangements will nullify it.
2853	The power weather guys will defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.
2853	If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups under Mike's leadership.
2853	Please, let me know what you think.
2853	Vince
2854	tsp
2855	Tanya: It was 3.
2855	Vince
2856	Joe, Thanks.
2856	Vince
2857	Gayle, Thanks for the invitation.
2857	Let's connect in the beginning of November to discuss the details.
2857	Vince
2858	Martin, Looks great.
2858	I have forwarded it to Sam.
2858	Vince
2859	Paul, I have left a message for Steve about your call.
2859	Vince
2860	I hope you will feel better soon.
2860	Vince
2861	Anita, Should we advise everybody to wait for the results of Martin's evaluation?
2861	Vince
2862	Laura, Thanks for confirming the meeting on September the 5th.
2862	We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda.
2862	Please, let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall be glad to adjust.
2862	I assume you are on Mountain Time and this means we shall lose one hour flying east from California.
2862	Vince
2863	Mike, I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation, given our relationship with the Wharton School.
2863	I think it can be somebody below Steve's level - the occasion does not justify allocating time of a senior executive.
2863	Vince
2864	Thanks for your message.
2864	I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713 853 5290), to set up the call with you.
2864	Vince Kaminski
2865	Tricia, Thanks a lot for your message.
2865	I am glad things are going well for you.
2865	It's quite hectic here as you know.
2865	I shall try to call you later this week to chat about the markets.
2865	Vince
2866	Thanks for your message.
2866	I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley for Jeff.
2866	I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.
2866	Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.
2866	Vince
2867	Shirley Please, inform the group.
2867	Vince
2868	Albert, Thanks.
2868	What is the time of the presentation?
2868	Vince Kaminski
2869	Dear Dr. Whitaker, I was contacted a few days ago by my friend, Richard McMinn, who is currently holding the Swiss Re Chair in the Management of Risk, Centre for Risk and Insurance Studies, Nottingham University Business School.
2869	Before moving to England, he was for many years with the University of Texas at Austin.
2869	He is also an editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance.
2869	Richard expressed interest in coming back to the States, and specifically to Texas.
2869	I remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff, that you are thinking about making several additions to the Faculty of Jones School, especially in the area of risk management.
2869	Richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search.
2869	I am attaching the address of Richard's CV.
2869	Please, feel free to contact me if you need more information about his academic credentials.
2869	Vince Kaminski
2870	Cathy, Thanks.
2870	I can use the tickets on the 12th or on the 25th.
2870	Vince
2871	13 files sent for R (public version of S).
2872	Bill, Thanks for selecting me as a panel participant.

2872	I hope your company is doing fine.
2872	Vince
2873	FYI Vince
2874	Gina, Thanks for your message.
2874	I shall contact Brian and we shall see you tomorrow at 6:00.

2875	We are confirming a meeting in your office at 4:00 p.m., Tuesday, next week.
2875	What about a dinner at 7:00?
2875	Vince
2876	Greg, Congratulations Vince
2877	Mark, Congratulations.
2877	Vince
2878	Vasant, FYI Vince
2879	John, Thanks for you messages and for a polo shirt I got from the MBA program in Dallas on Monday.
2879	I am doing fine - busy as usual.
2879	In case you missed it, and interesting article from the WSJ.
2879	Vince
2880	Gil, Thanks for your message.
2880	I stay in touch with many academic centers and shall be glad to bring up to your attention other potential candidates.

2880	Vince
2881	Hello Scott, Thanks for Sriram.
2881	I shall call you later this week with an update on our needs.
2881	Vince
2882	Mike, Thanks.
2882	Vince
2883	Richard, I have made discreet inquiries at Rice and it seems they are looking for somebody with a different profile than the one you represent.
2883	I think that the interest is more in a person with more financial institution risk management experience, with special applications to trading and energy trading in particular.
2883	Vince
2884	Jim, Thanks for your message.
2884	We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday.
2884	We shall be flying from San Jose in the morning and we can shoot for 9:30 a.m. arrival at your office, as long as it works for you.
2884	I shall forward your message to our lawyer and ask her to come up with a new version of an NDA.
2884	Look forward to meeting you next week.
2884	Vince
2885	Laura, I have just sent a message to Jim confirming our visit with you on September the 5th.
2885	Is 9:30 a.m. OK with you as our arrival time?
2885	Also, please, send me the directions to your location.
2885	Look forward to meeting you on Wednesday next week.
2885	Vince
2886	Norman, I have confirmed in my messages to Jim and Laura our visit in Santa Fe on Wednesday, September the 5th.

2890	Hello Darrell, Many changes in Enron kept me busy during the last few days.
2890	Rabi and Tanya are working on a new version of the documentation and we hope to send it to you in a few days.
2890	I agree with you that the document we sent you was rather cryptic and apologize for not screening it more effectively.
2890	I agree with you regarding point # 2 and so does Tanya.
2890	I think she did not explain precisely what she meant by her comment.
2890	I hope to talk to you soon.
2890	Vince P.S.
2890	We still owe you money for work done over the last 18 months.

0	Thanks for the link.
0	Sounds like they are doing well.
0	I'm sure that it is due to our analysis and advice.
0	I assume Mary has had her baby?
0	How is everything?
0	As for deer hunting, it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.
0	I have not taken anythin but our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.
0	The 10 point grossed 135 B&C swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr third largest ever.
0	(For calibration, mine grossed 166).
0	I have one good 8 point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting. I'm still open to you going there to take pictures. It may be hard to schedule but I really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and tkae some pics on your own. I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day. You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever. Call me at 281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out. Melissa and Hunter are doing well. He's 4 now and will start pre-school next year. We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet. Enron is great and everything I hoped for really. I will be rotating as scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar. How are things at Dell? Later, Charlie
1	Congratualtions, Will!
1	May God bless you and your family.
1	She's a beautiful baby.
1	How is recruiting going?
1	Any idea where you think you will end up.
1	I'm sorry it did not work out at Enron.
1	I know that you will do well wherever you go.
1	Charlie
2	I want the same as I currently have.
2	All I need is a page refill for 2001.
2	Thanks, Charlie
3	Shirley, I am scheduled to take vacation on December 22, 27, 28, and 29.
3	Thanks, Charlie
4	Kristin, The software has arrived.
4	I have not had a chance to check it out yet but will do so ASAP.
4	I've been gone for the last 4 working days.
4	Charlie
5	Jonathan, Hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend.
5	I'd like to catch up with you today if possible regarding recruiting etc. Can I reach you by phone.
5	If so, where?
5	You can call me toll free at 1-800-97-ENRON and follow the menu.
5	My extension is X57229 or you can use the voice activated system.
5	Thanks, Charlie
6	Had a great time this weekend.
6	I'm sure glad that Travis got another good buck under his belt.
6	I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty possible next year.
6	I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her painting.
6	Mama mentioned to Melissa that she "owed" her but nothing more than that.
6	She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the money.
6	Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this week as well.
6	If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.
6	Anyway, Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she wasn't able to "prove" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.
6	She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not working outside the home.
6	For the record, she busts her ass keeping our house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.
6	If there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good Christmas for everyone.
6	Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.
6	There is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.
6	I'm sure you see my point of view here.
6	Thanks!
6	Charlie
7	Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high quality job in your PRC representative role.
7	Per your request, I am attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last few months.
7	I am currently in my first rotation as an Associate which I began this past summer following graduation from UT with an MBA in Energy Finance.
7	I am assigned to Vince Kaminski's Research Group on the Market Fundamentals Team.
7	This team is commonly referred to as the "Weather Group" and is headed by my supervisor, Mike Roberts.
7	We are located on the gas trading floor (32nd) and provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives trading.
7	Thanks again for your interest and I am looking forward to meeting you.
7	Please let me know if you need any additional information.
7	Sincerely, Charlie Weldon
8	I will be unable to attend.
8	Thank You, Charlie Weldon
9	Thanks!
10	Here's the file.
10	If you break the date column up into three separate columns for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.
10	For example, you might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or year or whatever.
10	I c an help you do this if you want.
10	Remember that this is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering that the last 3 winters were far above normal.
10	If you want to investigate what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get you the data for many decades further back if wish.
10	Just let mw know.
10	Thanks, Charlie
11	Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?
11	It's trading at 25 forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.
11	A PEG of ~1 on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, right?
11	What's your view?
11	The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this is a tremendous value long-term.
11	It looks like the economy has really got the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high growth in technology?
11	I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.
11	Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.
11	This could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity.
12	Thanks for the info.
12	The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or think she deserves so we appreciate it.
12	No need to send any more, really.
12	If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present or something.
12	Are you going hunting this weekend?
12	It's going to be cold and probably wet so it should be perfect.
12	Charlie
13	Kristin, Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you requested.
13	I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in many of the cases the dataset is limited.
13	Additionally, I added some other stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not the exact station requested.
13	To firm up whether or not these surrogate stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.
13	I assume whoever needs this info has one.
13	Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.
13	This file is a good representation of the type of data available on the CD.
13	It may not be perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better data from any other source.
13	(Not that I will give up though) Thanks, Charlie
14	I guess I would have shot him.
14	Look out for very cold temps by this weekend and next week.
14	Coldest in 4 years.
15	I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.
15	It was 20 miles west of Menard on Hwy 190.
15	A great area that's for sure.
15	Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far: 1) 17", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest ever on ranch. Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs. 2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17", 11 point with a double main beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.
15	3) Travis shot a 16" 9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points. We've seen more bucks than we have since '93. More fawns than I ever remember. Maybe things have turned around for awhile. I've got some good videos I'll show sometime. When are ya'll coming?
16	I'll let you know where you can go.
16	Probably pretty much anywhere in Buddy's or I might can arrange for you to sit in another area.
16	It won't be a problem but we will need to communicate.
16	Right now my friend Weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a deer in 6 years and has paid my Dad ~$5000 over the period.
16	Paul is still hunting in there too and that's where Travis killed his deer.
16	Check out the following link on the weather: Take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are automated and tend to spit out some garbage.
16	However, a true blue norther should be coming and don't be surprised if Dallas sees the teens next week with highs below freezing.
17	We'll probably come down on the 21st.
17	If you are still there then maybe we can hook up and go out there together and laugh away the deer.
17	How does a January/February trip up to Grapevine sound?
17	Oh yeah, Melissa's pregnant.
17	Due first week in August.
17	It's early so we are being cautious but I figured you would want to know.
18	Up 8.5%!!!!, for now
19	Vince, Mr. Horn's request has been taken care of.
19	He has the data he wanted and knows how to call it up on his Bloomberg terminal in the future.
19	Charlie
20	Indeed.
20	If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach $10.
20	Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?
20	A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next week.
21	I saw it.
21	After our conversation, I did add some Citi and Wachovia and have since lost but I still think it's a good move.
21	Hopefully there will not be any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.
21	I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.
21	I'm pretty balanced now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).
21	ENE closing at $72+!!!!!
22	You ARE a professional
23	Any day next week except Monday or Thursday is good for me.
24	Not sure how I got your e-mail at v.charlie.weldon@enron.com but my username is v.charles.weldon@enron.com
25	I would recommend selling Intel today.
25	It is up with the market this morning even after a bad announcement.
25	The fundamentals for anything PC related going forward are the worse they have been in 5 years or more.
26	The best summary of what is going on here that I have read recently:
27	Jim, Are you going to invite the others?
27	Charlie
28	I saw that too.
28	I agree on Ferguson but I think Toombs will have to show that he can play with all his heart (and ass) every week.
28	He could be a Bettis type back if he stays committed.
29	In case you haev not heard, we are likely to have an ice storm here tomorow.
30	I would call this the Arctic Express.
30	I think Fergie will stay unless his grades knock him out.
30	In that case, I would say he is a third rounder or so, which ain't bad for 10 games in Div
31	I agree.
31	Even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the fact that (if) EBS is not fundamentally successful.
31	So the question is, is there a way to go long ENE and short EBS?
31	Probably not, but if there were a surrogate for EBS, the trade might work in most scenarios.
31	How about shorting a long-term broadband contract?
32	That's the irony
33	Not sure?
34	I am writing to inform you that the deadline for your offer of employment from Enron has been extended until January 2, 2001.
34	More information will follow between now and then.
34	If you have any questions regarding this extension, please call me at 1-800-97ENRON (extension 57229) or Kristin Gandy at extension 53214.
34	Thank You, Charlie Weldon
35	Per Shelly Jones, I sent this note to all UT MBA's that received offers for Associate positions.
36	Dr. Wilkens, Thank you for your time and advice.
36	I would appreciate if you would be able to provide me with contact information for Dr. Jim Jones at the University of Florida as well as Dr. Joe Ritchie, per your offer to do so.
36	Thanks again, Charlie Weldon
37	Bill, I enjoyed talking with you about our potential software needs.
37	It sounds like you may have something to offer in which we are interested, and we are looking forward to a visit from you or one of your representatives in early January.
37	If you want to contact me, I can be reached at 713-345-7229 or by reply to this E-mail.
37	Thank You, Charlie Weldon
38	Ouch!
39	Thank You!
40	Tomorrow's another day.
40	Looks like I bought ARBA at the top.
41	Todd, Thanks for the info.
41	I may need some help decoding the info so we can get exact durations for warnings.
41	However, I think we should wait until we get a genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more time on this.
41	It's definitely good that we have this data though should we need it.
41	Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.
41	Thanks, Charlie
42	Dave, Just wondering if you have had a chance to consider these new risk management tools we are considering.
42	Thanks!
42	Charlie Weldon Enron Corp - Houston
43	try this link for the "official" view on the economy and future Fed actions from Enron's chief economist: (It's a bit different than most)
44	Most useful buttons for you will be "Executive Summary" and "Cold Air Alert"
45	I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.
45	He definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.
45	I believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.
45	His interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.
45	I'll take over 800 yds next year if you take under.
46	He sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about.
46	I'll be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good Hayter is.
46	BEnson is the 4th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great Robert Strait from Cuero (85-88) and almost passing Rodney Thomas.
46	Those guys don't get redshirted.
46	I'm befuddled about the O-line numbers.
46	Ya'll got this kid Winston this weekend over us even though we have only one OL commit and need 4 or so.
46	Slocum has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we are doomed.
46	2 of the top 3 linemen are still available and we've got a reasonable shot at them but Hightower (#1) still says he's going to visit and consider Texas.
46	Amazing...
47	Any comments?.....
48	I've got SLR and FLEX in this group and maybe that's a good thing....we'll see
49	Gary, Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.
49	Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent earnings warning.
49	Among other things, they mention that they had tough comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.
49	I believe they are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my opinion.
49	One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.
49	I know that they are financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme cold.
49	They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.
49	Please let me know how I may be of assistance.
49	Thanks, Charlie
50	This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) newsletter.....
50	BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit, and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to weather.com to follow the storms.
50	In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into a local radio station for news.
50	TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent - with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the storm.
50	Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13 percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
50	A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at weather.com.
50	TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
50	rating of 0.751 on Monday, delivering an average of 586,000 households.
50	This performance is well over twice the average December monthly rating to date.
50	Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit.
50	The Chicago rating also was within the top 10.
51	Keep trying.
51	We are definitely interested.
51	How much does a pair of tickets to an inaugural ball run?
52	In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 and buy the tickets for $125.
52	This does sound like a good one to go to based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.
52	I imagine (hope) that the other balls are comparable.
52	I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated.
53	If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are indeed pathetic salesmen.
53	These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.
54	We've got a 2-deep OL lineup for next year but I question the quality as only a few were legit blue-chips and I like the odds of getting bluechips versus sleepers.
54	I think we'll get one of the 2 studs and maybe both.
54	The main concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of dominate line play.
54	We've got the skill guys, DB's and LB's.
55	Slightly different subject, check this link out.
55	Kiper seems to indicate that you must be a 3rd year soph or a junior to enter the draft.
55	Is this true?
55	Does it mean rising junior or completed junior?
55	Implications for Roy W. and UT?
56	I'm taking 4 hours vacation today and have updated my previous timesheet to reflect this.
56	Please see attached.

58	Ed, Here's the link to the gas fundamentals website that I mentioned.
58	It has a wealth of information on it, some of which the group can hopefully utilize.
58	(Use the dropdown box on the homepage to begin navigating to different areas) Charlie
59	Judy, Thanks for the info.
59	I hope you had a good holiday season.
59	I regret to inform you that I will be unable to continue in my participation in JA.
59	Ihave transitioned to a new role at Enron that will not accomodate the schedule neccesary to effectively serve as a JA volunteer.
59	I take my commitments very seriously so my inability to fulfill this obligation is nosomething I am totally comfortable with.
59	However, upon reviewing the situation I realize that this decision is necessary.
59	Thank you for your help and energy and I wish you all the luck with the kidand the program.
59	What you do is truly making a positive difference in manyof these kids' futures.
59	Charlie Weldon
60	Oh yeah.
60	Did you go to lunch with Juan Verde?
61	test
62	Not gonna happen.
62	Offer up 5 total all in sign on, plus they guaranteed the same y-e that we have.
62	where before it was not detailed.
63	No, did you?
63	Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news: announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share.
63	In addition, the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper range of current estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30 percent.
64	I will not be able to attend.
64	Thanks, Charlie
65	FYI - Attached is a quote from a recent TWC memo that should be of interest given our recent conversations....
65	Charlie "December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to quieter than usual hurricane activity."
66	did you do it?
67	I will be there.
67	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
68	Why don't you buy deep in the money put options?
68	They will have a high delta and hence move almost dollar for dollar with the stock.
69	Check out NOK Feb 55 puts, NZYMK.X They are up 4-5/8 while NOK is down 4-5/8.
69	2932 contracts out wth 24 traded today so liquidity shouild be OK.
69	Buy 400 ERICY for ~$4000 and one NOK put contract of NZYMK.x.
69	That should give you a delta on NOK equiv to shorting $4000 of the stock.
69	Did I figure this right?
70	sounds somewhat believable.
70	I can imagine the frenzy on the discussion boards if that got out.
70	I won't be the one to put it out there.
70	i think one more year and then its done.
70	Would the motivation for the Aggie AD to work really be only money?
71	Yep.
71	We won't miss him as much as we will Fergie if he goes though.
71	I think if he's fully committed to being as good a pro as possible he could be really good.
71	We'll see.
72	WE'll likely move Joe Weber to FB.
72	He's ~225 lbs and pretty fast for a FB so he'll do.
72	Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on the scout team.
72	I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that good.
72	He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last few years of recruiting.
73	ENE up 1-3/4!
73	Option bid only up 3 teenies from where I bought it though.
73	the spread on options is about a 1/4 which makes it tough.
74	Rebecca, I was looking in EHROnline at my available vacation to verify that it all got accounted for correctly in 2000.
74	It appears that it did except for the fact that when I attempted to view my available vacation for 2001, it only indicates that I have 120 hours available.
74	I should have an additional 16 hours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left over.
74	Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?
74	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
75	Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of $84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility.
75	The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering aftershocks throughout the U.S. energy community.
75	As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California has rapidly reached crisis proportions.
75	Strict environmental legislation and the uncertain profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years.
75	The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are facing the prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity purchased on the open market.
75	However, the rates the utilities can charge their customers for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation.
75	The risks to Enron are two-fold.
75	For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron.
75	Although the company does operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global revenue streams.
75	In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the region.
75	More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis abates.
75	Some also fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended economic consequences.
75	Neither scenario is probable.
75	For one thing, the airline industry was deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination along the way.
75	And a strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment.
75	The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best course of action this week.
75	It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E and Edison's ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap.
75	Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last week.
75	The initial euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic economic growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity.
75	As a result, we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized defensive plays like Enron.
75	We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been overlooked amid the California crisis.
75	The November-December period was 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in the past 50 years.
75	Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly in natural gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months.
75	In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the future.
75	The markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next year.
75	An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send profits measurably higher in the long term.
75	Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share.
75	Although the stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the market approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going forward
76	I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.
76	It may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.
76	If it doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.

81	Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the new-power/alternative energy industries.
81	Unlike broader energy funds, this pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

83	A good time, indeed!
83	Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the near future.
83	I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" or otherwise contribute.
83	I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your knowledge of business, etc. We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.
83	I'm looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around.

86	Sorry I did not get to call last night.
86	I'll try tonight after 8:00.
86	Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address?

86	We'll talk about what to sell later.
86	Love, Charlie
87	The taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.
87	It will be much less than $2000.
87	For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron stock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain.
87	I'll look at it tonight.

92	Just tell them to send you $2000.
92	You should have at least that in cash.
92	If there is any extra leftover and you need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.
92	Enron is up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.

96	How many Merck shares do you have left, is it just a fraction?
97	I think so but if not we'll just leave them in there.
98	I have a meeting in Cuero at 10:00 am this Saturday that will last only an hour or so.
98	Other than that, we have no reason to go.
98	Maybe you could fly me to that?
98	If so, I'll need to ask Melissa.
98	She would not haev to go in that case and can stay and recuperate.
99	I need to check with Melissa first.
99	I'll call her now.
100	Hold off on the reservations as I cannot get hold of her.
100	She may want to drive for another reason I don't know of.
100	How long would we have to decide if we did want to fly.
100	Also, could Melissa and Hunter go also.
101	Here's a link to the data.
101	I'll come over there and show you where it is exactly
102	I'm going to get some scanned shortly.
102	Didn't get the CD.

109	Sounds like Goldman has a pretty low opinion of Dupont's management.
109	not surprising.....
110	Yep.
110	If you are looking for a free trip to Austin, you should go to this.
111	This could be big...
112	This could turn into something big....

114	We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy technology investment opportunities so I'm confifdent we won't miss out on any opportunity in this market.
115	I got your e-mail.
115	We are planning on coming.
115	Melissa is better, not totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.
115	Sorry about Jimmy.
115	He's having a heck of a time.
116	try this one...
117	I think I better stick around my new job for a little longer before I run off.
117	I've got a training class again next week so I'm going to be out 2 days.
117	I think I'm going to Austin in late Feb for the internship interviews.
118	That sounds good.

119	$1 from you and $151 from Vikas on my MArch Nymex trade I closed today.
119	Yeah!
120	Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects....
120	3.
120	Agricultural Modeling In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop modeto predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forwardweather scenarios.
120	We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is highregarded in the agricultural modeling community.
120	One of the primary authorof this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State University and is moving to Texas.
120	Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest inproviding assistance to us in setting up this software.
120	His new address is217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742.
120	His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchiewould be ideal for providing us the help that we need.
120	A second software product known as &Pcyield8 has been suggested.
120	Pcyield is based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.
120	HoweverDr.
120	Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is probably the better fit for our needs.
120	The salesman for Pcyield is namedBill Bodine and he works for a company called Mpower 3.
120	He has indicatedthat he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd.
121	Andrew, Note conference room for our meeting today.
121	I'm also attaching a brief writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.
121	You might want to review before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or misunderstanding :-) ) of the deal currently is.
121	Thanks, Charlie
122	I'm staying away from small caps.
122	Note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news.
123	This guy has amazingly good 20/20 hindsight.
123	He's painting the Fed as behind the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this New Economy.
123	In fact, it was Greenspan's willingness to embrace the New Economy's higher GDP "speed limit" and unemployment "floor" that enabled this unprecedented economic expansion.
123	While it is true that the Fed's tightening is largely responsible for this downturn, it is not solely responsible; and it is the Fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road.
124	I got my W-2 but I haven't looked into the impact of moving on income.
125	I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.
125	He was pretty old and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and intelligent man.
125	About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont and I stayed over the weekend with him.
125	He took me all around Salt Lake City and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.
125	That's what I will remember about him most.
126	I'm in on Calpine.
126	Just bought.
127	Per Andrew, Let's plan on meeting (or at least touching base) on Thursday at 3:00.
127	I'm attaching a revised summary and a spreadsheet derived from the one Maria sent me on Monday.
127	Please take time to review both documents to see if we're still heading down the right path....
128	Just fill out form and send $2000 in. Contribution is for year 2001.
128	I've been real busy.
129	It's Saturday.
129	Will that work?
130	Lunch is likely.
130	Call me then
131	Andrew, Can we move tomorrow's meeting to 5:00 instead of 3:00?
131	I have a structuring class all day.
131	Mark will need to leave at ~5:30 so I'll try to be up here a little early if possible.
131	I'll send a nother note with a conference room if I can get one.
131	Thanks, Charlie
132	I just bought some more CPN.
132	CEFT has a great 5 yr chart and doesn't seem too expensive but I don't understand their business risks as much as CPN so I'm going to stick with them.
132	I may give it some more thought if I could find a good research report on them.
133	Let me know when the money is there and we will buy something
134	Files are located in Gas Structuring\LNG\Australia
135	I bought it at 41 and 42 ovver the last week and it's looking good.
135	I bought them based on industry, strategy, and PEG.
135	Check it out.
136	FYI - I created a folder for all Stagecoach files in
137	Kristin, I plan to attend as a greeter if needed.
137	Is there a reception on the Wednesday night prior to first-round interviews?
137	Thanks, Charlie
138	You may consider linking to this regular column from your gopusa site.
139	I'm always ready to crap but if you want assistance pre-crap, then let me know..
140	One less competitor............
141	My cousin told me about chewing your ass out.
141	He was pretty embarassed as he is really a nice guy.
142	Here's the link to the gas fundamentals site:
143	John, Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.
143	The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions: 1) Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.
143	2) National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.
143	The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.
143	It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.
143	3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.
143	Let me know if you have any further questions.
143	Thanks, Charlie
144	Here are the updated curves as of last nights close.
144	Let me know if you need anything else.
144	Charlie
145	The curves in this file were off by a month since April is no longer valid.
145	See the attached file for the correct prices and months.
145	Charlie
146	Eric and I will come by ~4:00.
146	Thanks, Charlie
147	My supervisor is Ed Mc Michael.
148	thanks
149	yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to fork out the $60 to take my family now, versus $15 and being less crowded.
150	Suzette, Monday morning should work.
150	Just give me a call.
150	I'm tied up in the p.m.
150	but a.m. should work.
150	Charlie
151	I'm not sure.
151	WE're going to the Astros tonight and are working on the nursery I think.
151	Other than that, not much
152	Same as before except changed cob date to 4/27 instead of 4/24 on quote sheet.
153	Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.
153	Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
153	The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.
153	(Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now) Thanks, Charlie
154	The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.
154	(NOTE: The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation. The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.) 1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft.
154	Pierce's 82MW.
154	2) Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.
154	This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour) The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements: MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft.
154	Pierce Capacity (from FGU) Phase VI Capacity Capacity From East Desk NTOE: Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.
154	3) Ft.
154	Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.
154	4) For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft.
154	Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.
154	This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour) 5) Because Ft.
154	Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.
154	These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.
154	6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft.
154	Pierce via FGU.
154	These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below: MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft.
154	Pierce Capacity (from FGU) Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer) Capacity From East Desk NOTE: Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.
154	7) Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.
155	We'll be there Friday night and plan to spend the night.
155	If Elizabeth would rather spend the night with her friend, that's fine.
155	Hunter can play with Travis that night and be plenty happy.
155	Love, Charlie

Charles Weldon Alumni / Program Contact Id (SSN): *********Graduation Year: 2000 Applicant Name: Suzette Emmons Visit Location: Houston Visit Date: 4/30/01 Trait Description Rating (1 through 4) Comments Communication Skills 1 Very strong and effective communicator.
156	Poise / Confidence 1 No problem here.
156	Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.
156	Leadership Potential 1 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.
156	Personality / Enthusiasm 1 Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being a Texas MBA student.
156	Maturity 2 She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.
156	Clarity of Professional Focus 2 Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded.
156	Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue.
156	You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings.
156	We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.
156	She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.
156	She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.
156	I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.
156	Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program?
156	Please elaborate on any reservations you may have.
156	Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.
156	She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.
156	Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.
157	Matt, Would you please make sure that David gets to see this tomorrow.
157	Mark asked me to send this so you could print it out and have Dave look at it and then recommend would else ought to see it.
157	Would you plese E-mail me or call me with a list of who else needs to see this sometime tomorrow, per Mark.
157	Thanks, Charlie
158	I just deleted a bunch.
158	LEt me know if I need to do anymore.
159	Enron Avg = 90 injected Industry avg = 86 injected I-Bank Avg = ~72 injected (they should stick to banking) My number is 88.
159	I think the market has already built in a 90 or less number.
160	We should make it by 6:45 plus or minus 30 minutes
161	We are planning on bringing Flossie if that's OK.
162	Why are energy stocks down so much today?
162	My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price.
163	Great.
163	Flossie is a Maxine, not a Max
164	Suzette, I was able to fill out an evaluation form on Tuesday and submit it by E-mail.
164	Hopefully they will accept it OK.
164	It was nice meeting you and I wish you good luck in the admissions process.
164	Sincerely, Charlie
165	Attached in Bold are the answers to all the questions except 6 and 8.
165	The major outstanding issue as of right now is the final determination of specs for the fuel oil from Mitsubishi..
166	FYI - I'm looking into this.
166	Could be my ticket but there are a few issues I have to resolve.
167	Karen, Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon.
167	I look forward to hearing from you.
167	Sincerely, Charlie Weldon
168	We enjoyed ourselves and are glad that we were able to visit.
168	We're looking forward to you coming to our house in a few weeks Love, Charlie
169	PAth to deal Status is O:\NAES\NATTS\ADM\Deal Status
170	thanks!
171	Karen, I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.
171	I just noticed that I replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.
171	I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.
171	Thanks, Charlie
172	Soma, Per your request, I've calculated a Houston Area notional swap price for 6/01 through 12/04.
172	I used the IF-Katy mid curve as of today's close and have not adjusted for any injection or withdrawal charges that may need to be accounted for in your analysis.
172	If you need any further help, please let me know.
172	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
173	Doug, Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft.
173	Pierce facility in Florida.
173	As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.
173	We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.
173	In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.
173	Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.
173	Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.
173	Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.
173	I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.
173	If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.
173	Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.
173	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
174	Matt, Thank you very much for the info.
174	I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.
174	I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.
174	For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.
174	I have also asked him to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.
174	I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.
174	Thanks again for all your help.
174	Charlie
175	Mike, I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.
175	I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.
175	He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.
175	Please let me know if you have any questions.
175	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
176	Doug, Thanks for the info.
176	I have passed it along.
176	I have one more question regarding heating values.
176	Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?
176	I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.
176	Thanks, Charlie
177	Here's another good article:
178	John, Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous quotes, the new updated notionl bid is $4.51/MMBTU.
178	Let me know if you need any more assistnace.
178	Thanks, Charlie

180	Guys,, I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.
180	That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.
180	How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?
180	Thanks, Charlie
181	B2B = business to business, usually referring to on-line (Internet-based) electronic commerce (e-commerce).
182	Is this guy short ENE or what?
182	He has a couple of decent points about our "fuzzy" math.
182	but we won't miss earnings, guaranteed, for at least a couple quarters.
183	Thanks for the info!
184	Doug, This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.
184	According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).
184	Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.
184	Charlie
185	Bill, I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft.
185	Pierce project.
185	I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec.
185	Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.
185	We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.
185	Thanks!
185	Charlie Weldon
186	I'll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny.
187	Doug, Fax is 646-3460.
187	A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.
187	I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.
187	Thanks again, Charlie
188	Our "spec" is <.05 ppm.
188	I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.
188	We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.
188	I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.
188	The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.
188	Thanks, Charlie
189	The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.
189	Charlie
190	Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10) Note the volatility in these that I graphed.
190	This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.
190	Charlie
191	Kim, The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.
191	I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.
191	I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.
191	I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.
191	Sorry for the confusion.
191	Let me know if you need any more assistance.
191	Thanks, Charlie
192	Thanks Doug, Can you confirm (or tell me how I can) that these sample charge are being routed to Co#0413, RC#106230 per my previous note.
192	Enron North America Corp. From: V Charles Weldon 05/14/2001 09:02 AM
193	Glad to hear Buddy is getting better.
193	I assume we still need rain but are doing OK given the good rain 2 weeks ago.
193	We may come this weekend or next.
193	Will know tonight.
194	As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.
194	I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.
194	The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.
194	He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000.
194	Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.
194	Thanks, Charlie
195	Mike, The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.
195	We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.
195	Thanks, Charlie
196	Matt, Doug Leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for Ft.
196	Pierce.
196	I believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow.
196	In order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved, I am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning.
196	Please let me know what your availability is.
196	Thanks!
196	Charlie
197	got it
198	Go it
199	Matt, Two quick questions that Doug Leach needs answered ASAP to get the oil ordered: 1) Name and number of contact person for handling the accounting/paperwork type issues at HD King plant.
199	2) Name and number of contact person for logistic/scheduling issues at HD King plant.
199	Thanks, Charlie
200	Got it
201	Thanks Mike.
201	Would you mind providing the MW and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes.
201	Thanks, Charlie
202	Doug, The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.
202	His phone number is 561-464-5792.
202	Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.
202	(He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us) Thanks, Charlie
203	Just want to remind everyone that the exact quantity is 202,000 gallons, isn't that right David?
204	Steve, As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.
204	The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.
204	Let me know if you need anything else.
204	Charlie
205	Thank you Doug!
205	Sorry this thing turned into such a mess along the way.
205	I appreciate the help you have given both me and the team.
205	Charlie
206	David, Attached is a summary calculation of the net payment owed FPUA for the fuel oil transaction.
206	Please let me know if you have any questions.
206	Thanks, Charlie
207	Todd, Attached is my resume per our conversation.
207	Thanks, Charlie
208	I want to remain a member
209	Dutch, Here's the quote sheet starting in August.
209	Thanks, Charlie
210	FYI......
210	(and I'll provide the update he is requesting)
211	Are you staying?
212	Ed, I'm interested in taking this course as I've heard it was pretty good.
212	I have applied to take it within the training system and it should be queued up for your approval if you support me taking it.
212	Thanks, Charlie
213	John, Thanks for the upate.
213	Sorry to hear this deal has been further delayed.
213	The updated gas price is 4.625 as of last night's curves.
213	Thanks, Charlie
214	FYI...and thanks again!
215	FYI - There's also an opening on the Texas Gas Desk that may give me the opportunity to short-circuit the "required" rotations.
215	We'll see.
216	Slight problem, can't get the room in 3 Allen center b/c they turn down the A/C on the weekend and need a cost code to cover any desired cooling.
216	Hence, we will likely end up in the Enron building in a less nice room but we'll manage.
217	June settled at 3.738.
217	No pressure to pay but wanted to document.
217	Later....
218	Chris, Attached are the prices you requested.
218	Please let me know if I can help you in any way, as we discussed.
218	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
219	Cool.
219	I'll set up a payment plan if you wish, with competitive rates.
219	:-)
220	Attaached are the notional bids you requested.
220	Please contact me or Eric if you have any querstions .
220	Thanks, Charlie Weldon
221	MArk asked me to FW this to you
222	John, Ignore the last message.
222	Kelli Little is going to look at your deal...
223	Rain is good.
223	I think Travis is coming to our house for a few days also.
223	Enron stock is a long story but we'll just all have to be patient.
223	I've been swamped.
223	Call you when I'm on the bus
224	Let's shoot for lunch next Tuesday.
224	Would one of you please contact me that a.m. to see how the day is going.
224	It's been pretty hectic lately but I think we will be able to do it.
224	Thanks, Charlie
225	FYI
226	Desk is 3274D Thanks
227	Joan, Here are the basis numbers only.
227	Sorry this took so long.
228	FYI - A very good summary of the newly passed tax bill....

229	Thanks!
230	Kelli took care of it.
231	Team, We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.
231	Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".
231	In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client" You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".
231	You will have to reboot after installation is complete.
231	After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".
231	The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).
231	On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.
231	Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.
231	Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.
231	You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.
231	A word of caution: We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.
231	For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.
231	Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.
231	Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.
231	Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.
231	I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.
231	Thanks, Charlie
232	I'll click the ad from home.
232	Your newsletter is massively jumbled on my Outlook here at work.

238	Sounds like a good deal to me.
238	We'll see what they say.
239	It might but low three are all but a certainty.
239	I got the job on the Texas Desk.
239	I'll start there in July/August.

265	One G2 was 10.5.
265	Other was ~9.5.
265	G3's were 7.5 ish, maybe 8.
265	I thought it was a pretty good deer.
265	He would have been really good next year but we've let so many go like that not to ever see them again...
265	, I'm really glad he got this one to break his 7 year drought.
265	This was his 8th season.

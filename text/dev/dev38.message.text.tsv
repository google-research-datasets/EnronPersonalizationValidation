18	Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by New York State Regulators (London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long Island.
18	The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580- megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility.
18	The ruling kicks- off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.
18	International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001.
18	This application, which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project, including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.
18	"The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said Peter Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer.
18	"We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added.
18	For additional information, please contact: Media contact: (Europe) Media & Investor contact: (United States) Paul Parshley Notes to Editors- The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66 and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven.
18	When completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million homes.
18	The project will also result in additional significant benefits to the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.
18	International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net) under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
18	Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand.
18	International Power was created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on 2 October 2000.
18	The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges is "IPR".

93	While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.
93	If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.
93	If you have any questions please let me know.
93	I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack...
93	then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

102	Gary, We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.
102	Currently, I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.
102	In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.
102	I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron.
102	The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area.
102	My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.
102	I look forward to talking to you soon.

104	As far as the shift notes go: I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.
104	The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).
104	The link for the spreadsheet is: ..
104	you might have been using an old version.
104	I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.
104	It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market.

114	Sorry for saying that..
114	did not mean to upset my honey.
114	I am tired.
114	Love ME :(
115	Rebecca, Let me know if you see any differences.
115	Paul
116	Well Aaron, It is great to hear that you are doing well.
116	Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio.
116	We got married in small church on the Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.
116	Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.
116	My parents, family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!
116	We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.
116	I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy.
116	The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.
116	We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there.
116	Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it off.
116	As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.
116	I imagine we will have one in a year or so...
116	right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim.
116	Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.
116	Not such a bad place to be stuck.
116	I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.
116	It is different from most great cities in the world.
116	For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc...
116	however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).
116	The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.
116	It is the cidade maravillosa!!!
116	Take care and have a great Christmas.
116	Paul
117	Aaron, The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot..
117	older home that needed some fixing up.
117	At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.
117	The Houston Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.
117	Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare.
117	The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!
117	However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.
117	Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.
117	When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.
117	I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.
117	One day the contractor almost died in the house...
117	he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.
117	He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!
117	He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!
117	Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.
117	It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron.
117	All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.
117	Talking about wild flowers and plants..
117	the same is true for Costa Rica.
117	Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica.
117	I recommend that on your places to go list.
117	Merry Christmas, Feliz Natal, and Feliz Navidad Later Paul
118	This is good hoon...
118	look
119	I think these are the sunglasses that I am going to order.

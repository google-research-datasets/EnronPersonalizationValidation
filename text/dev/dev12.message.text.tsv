8	Michael and I have talked to Jim Keller, EES Legal, and initiated placement of Michael on the Creditor Committee.
8	We are the largest unsecured creditor.
8	Jim is working with outside counsel and will be providing documents to Michael to insert him quickly in the process.
8	Michael will represent us for both EES and ENA.

9	Would appreciate any feedback from talk so we can improve Tx, Rick
10	Any progress here.
10	Rick
11	Any more on this issue.
11	Rick
12	Did this go ok.
12	Rick
13	Please do not extend offers of employment to anyone without checking with me first.
13	This does not mean a freeze but rather I want to be sure there isn't a person in RAC that may be better suited, or could be with a little training, for a particular position.
13	Thanks, Rick
14	to your hearts content
15	fine
16	I was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us covering any issues arising during the month of December.
16	Since there seems to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have Steve start in EBS on 1-1-2001.
16	Ted can't physically be there until then.
16	It will be difficult to have full RAC responsibility without physically being there.
16	Rick
17	you have been busy haven't you, rick
18	I am not sure I understand this.
18	Can I still surf without going thru the Enron system?
18	Can I still use AOL?
18	I will only need full Enron access about half the time the rest a direct dsl internet connection is what I want.
18	Is the DSL line on all the time or is it still dial up.?
18	Rick
19	not to worry- we won't be cutting your budget.
19	lets discuss when you get back.
19	rick
20	Sounds great.
20	Don't build me a Rolls when a Chevy will do.
20	Rick
21	wow!
21	pretty bold move assuming you had a choice.
21	i will be in london next week, i'll try to give you a call.
21	rick
22	I have already left him a voice mail.
22	Will let you know when I hear.

23	Approve as written.

25	This is fine by me.
25	Do you need hard copy of signature.
25	Rick
26	fyi, rick
27	London???
27	How do we include?
27	Rick
28	Thank you very much for taking the time to provide this feedback.
28	Feedback, both positive and negative, is critical to improving performance.

29	a "senses"??
29	i love chi-knees- rick
30	fyi, rick
31	Can you please add Greg Whalley to the distribution on this report, which by the way is quite bebficial to us.
31	Tx Rick Buy
32	sounds like an opportunity for our illustrious steel team!
33	Totally supportive of candidate.
33	I hope we can get her.
33	Only issue was reluctance to move to Houston or London.
33	That will hurt us eventually.
33	Rick
34	Bad problem, good response.
34	Are there any others where price wasn't being updated?
34	Rick
35	Spoke with Jeff re TXU.
35	Lets discuss when you have a minute.
35	Rick
36	Missed your call today and I will be in RAC PRC all day tomorrow.
36	Basically Jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the statement.
36	He did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we said no, and I also said we know more about this company than any other exposure we have (which we should).
36	I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank.
36	Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU through the plant purchase or other structured deal.
36	Do no more (large) deals with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously.
36	Continue to stay on top of TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close relationship with good communication.
36	Lets try and discuss Wed if possible.
37	i guess this is the answer to my inquiry on cypress issue-rick
38	great news!
38	i think the ad swap idea is one of the most creative things to happen around here in quite a while.
38	rick
39	Looks good to me.
39	Rick Buy (Please pass along to John S. )
40	Good job.
40	Keep moving it forward.
40	If moving forward it will improve.
40	Rick
41	I think you should arrange for a formal presentation of this material to myself and other folks in RAC.
41	I believe this is the direction of future risk control activity and all of us need to be updated.
41	Scheduling something after the board meeting would be helpful.
41	Tx Rick
42	Karen- please print this out.
42	I need to edit this.
42	Thanks, Rick
43	This slipped thru the cracks- are we still going to do?
43	Did you do it already?
43	Rick
44	did i send this to already?
44	fyi.
44	this was very contentious at India mtg w/ Lay & Skilling.
44	We need to understand what our exposure is.
44	You need to become our India expert.
44	Tx Rick
45	Kind of old but still relavent.
45	FYI Rick
46	Have had problems with my computer but I found this memo unread.
46	(May be because I have 2000 emails).
46	Should we still pursue this?
46	I know Jack is working on copper mines.
46	Maybe you guts started without me getting involved.
46	Lets discuss.
46	Rick
47	How is progress on this?
47	Rick
48	Mark- here is my response to your request.
48	Call with questions.
48	Goal: Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.
48	Performance: Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee Dec 11.
48	The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to.
48	Also, a template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes in the future.
48	Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure prior to this activity.
48	As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging activity resulting from this effort.
48	Goal: Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.
48	Performance: Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across EES.
48	A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results presented to the Finance Committee.
48	A RAC task force has been put in place which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit control systems where they need to be.
48	Significant progress has been made against these recommendations.
48	DSM projects have been spot tested with outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES.
48	These tests have highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best employed.
48	Goal: Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.
48	Performance: Complete and Ongoing.
48	During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to.
48	A data base system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to.
48	Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really understand where we have risks.
48	It also helps in defining where we don't have responsibility such as EOTT, Azurix and The New Power Company.
49	test
50	fyi, rick
51	have been unable to return your call.
51	will do tomorrow.
51	it has been crazy here to say the least.
51	rick
52	No- the conclusion is incorrect.
52	The peakers help to mitigate the risk created by market positions.
52	Maybe just change the last sentence to read "Because the peakers offset the contract, the VAR is substantially reduced. " Rick
53	Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley.
53	Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000).
53	Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).
53	One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or fri of this week, unless we increase them as well.
53	(They sweep retail deals into book once a week on this day).
53	This increase only needs to be $2-3- million.
53	Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks.
53	Rick
54	good info.
54	i don't believe there will be many more "ei" type asset acquisitions any time soon.
54	rick
55	Thanks, we are in bounds for the moment.
55	Rick
56	tx- caps were eliminated so this should improve??
56	rick
57	will not attend, tx rick
58	Send him what was in books but no notes.
58	Tell him it changes daily in a huge way.
58	Tx Rick PS I stopped down earlier to thank you for a great job on the BOD meeting.
58	See you at 4:30.
59	thanks, they do a great job and are an under-appreciated asset at enron.
59	rick
60	Per your voice mail I would like to defer 100% of my ECT Phantom Stock into the Stable Asset fund.
60	I only want to defer that which I have to defer due to my Section 16b status.
60	Thanks, Rick Buy
61	Probably a smart decision.
61	Rick
62	Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD interest rate curves before submitting their data to Houston.
62	I am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business London.
62	Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now.
62	This would greatly improve the efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.
62	Can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there.
62	Thanks, Rick
63	Everyone in RAC is invited to attend Underwriting mtg on Friday at 10:30 am.
63	Rick
64	fyi, please respond, tx rick
65	Deal needs to go to Skilling (or OOC) because capital price exceeds return.
65	Otherwise Frevert could sign.
65	I am authorised to sign for Jeff up to $25 MM after I leave him a voice mail.
65	After I review deal I will voice mail Jeff and that should work.
65	Rick
66	fyi, rick
67	fyi, rick
68	Thanks for note.
68	Mike Jordan in UK is coordinating an effort on this.
68	I'm worried we have more than initiative going on here.
68	Hopefully everyone will coordinate.
68	Rick
69	ok, but can't do anything until jan.
69	rick
70	I have two nominations for MD and one for VP.
70	VP David Port MD Ted Murphy Dave Gorte All of the above would be in the Specialized Technical category.
70	Call me if a problem, Rick Buy
71	The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in London.
71	Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the London office and mange the RAC activities which include credit and market risk and underwriting.
71	Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk activities.
71	Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new assignment within EBS, also in London.
71	The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent and accurate manner across the company.
71	Hopefully this realignment will accomplish that goal.
71	Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new assignments.
72	I would like Bill Bradford there unless someone is trying to llimit headcount.
72	Rick
73	I will request this extension at tomorrow's executive committee of the board mtg.
73	rick
74	This needs to be sent company wide.
74	Lets discuss how.
74	Tx Rick
75	I have no idea who sent me this message.
75	I did not like the sound of the name so I forwarded it to both of you.
75	It is not a pornographic e-mail but I the name sounds funny.
75	FYI.
75	Trying to stay out of trouble.
75	Rick
76	Spoke with John Sherriff this am re prc for London RAC people.
76	John said they included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our people where we saw fit.
76	So I don't think there is any issue here.
76	The Houston PRC rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to light to you Steve that calls into question a person's ranking.
76	Sheila- please double check with the London HR people that this is straightened out.
76	Thanks, Rick
77	Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision.
77	He is willing to enter into the deal.
77	His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final analysis.
77	He did say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as appropriate for the circumstances.
77	He also wanted to know if there is anything different here than on OWC.
77	I told him that it wasn't significantly different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached) Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get his verbal signature.
77	Rick
78	Is this correct?
78	Rick
79	After rereading 3 times I see your point.
79	Didn't mean it that way.
79	Before I sent it out I had Ted and Karen review as well as another person in corp.
79	None had any comments.
79	I asked Dave Gorte if he saw anything negative in it, he did not.
79	Didn't mean to slight you in any way and I apologize if I did.
79	Rick
80	Please get involved here and let these people know this.
80	Tx Rick
81	I have done this 3 times now.
82	excellent!!!!!
83	god help them Best of luck, Rick
84	keep 'em coming, rick
85	Karen- Wanted to say thanks for the gifts you gave me the other day for xmas.
85	I know I often appear ungrateful but that's what happens when you have 2 thousand things on your mind.
85	The pen and leather "thing" for notes are great- I'll use both in my annual attempt to get organised.
85	Rick
86	Thanks- You guys need a rest.
86	Have a great holiday.
86	Rick
87	This looks good.
87	Possibly don't need last two items , we need to decide when to review this once it is live to see if it is taking off.
87	Also, what does t aking off mean?
87	Certainly after a month.
87	See what others think about this list and then we can decide what our plan should be.
87	I'll talk to you in a day or two.
87	Rick
88	Lets have a brief meeting on this.
88	I'll have Karen set up.
88	Tx Rick
89	Sorry to hear your news.
89	Thanks for letting me know.
89	Rick
90	Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors.
90	In order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford.
90	Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to immediately add value to the CRM group.
90	It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign personnel as market needs suggest.
90	Please join me in congratulating Ken on his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.
90	Rick Buy
91	Pam- Please send this to RAC worldwide.
91	Tx Rick
92	I guess I don't have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but I do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper.
92	There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash prepared, Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task.
92	We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse.
92	Maybe Michael could be led to "suggest" an alternative memo or approach.
92	A "problem deal" memo.
92	If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I don't care if they don't sign it.
92	Once the website is functional, it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process.
92	One final thought, Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we should pick battles carefully.
92	Rick
93	I told you wrong on date for next mtg if you need approval.
93	That date would be Feb 13.
93	I'm tied up w/ bonus/review stuff for foreseeable future.
93	feb works better for lunch.
93	Rick
94	FYI
95	Weird, but ok by me.
95	Rick Buy
96	OK by me.
96	Only because I know Frank.
96	Rick
97	thanks, rick buy
98	Attached
99	Hi- Thanks for the note.
99	Remember that Karen reads all my mail so don't send anything too personal.
99	Time to get back into studying.
99	It will be over before you know it and the four years is a small fraction of your working life so keep at it.
99	I will look into London for your spring break.
99	Send me the exact times you have off.
99	Love Dad.
100	I really appreciate it when people take the time to acknowledge Mark's efforts and others in RAC as well.
100	Thanks for the feedback.
100	Rick
101	fyi- wasn't there a discussion on this at prc?
101	rick
102	please schedule
103	Are your plans to stay on 28?
103	We are doing some planning on office space.
103	I have some people in 3 Allen that I would like to move over here but it is not a big issue.
103	I had heard that you were moving.
103	Tx Rick
104	We are probably ok for now since we got the space from networks.
104	Rick
105	Yes we should present fx exposure at every meeting just like credit exposure tec.
105	Format as before.
105	Rick
106	Tx Please stay on top of this and pass on info to Bradford for inclusion in our overall Calif. analysis.
106	Rick
107	wow!
107	what's behind this, not that I think it isn't a very prudent decision.
107	rick
108	Are these numbers consistent with your expectations.
108	We will submit to HR if no onjections.
108	Traditionally Sutton has looked at the range and made the decision where to be inside the range.
108	I don't know if Skilling will do the same.
108	I have a voice mail into him to see.
108	Rick
109	Lets discuss this before we make offer.
109	Rick
110	You all should have received instruction from Sheila W. on the system for salaries.
110	I need that info late today so I can look at over the weekend.
110	Numbers are due Monday am.
110	Rick
111	Chip is assigned to North America primarily but we asked him to get up to speed on the India situation in case a new deal should arise there that requires RAC input.
111	He is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience and also worked in London for Eastern.
111	If you don't want him involved and a transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly, given the complexities.
111	Rick
112	Great!
112	This is exactly how I want everything in RAC to work.
112	Rick
113	I will be unable to attend this meeting as I will be in Canada meeting with banks.
113	Bill Bradford could attend in my absense if Dan thinks appropriate.
113	Rick
114	I go away for a day and come back to yet another $40 million of PGE exposure.
114	I guess the lesson is to not go away.
114	Where does this end?
114	This is a painful way to learn about derivative credit exposure.
114	Please inform all "deal doers" at EES that they better have RAC review their deals (Mercury) in detail before they sign.
114	This is more out of control than anything else we have at Enron.
114	Rick
115	I like this slide from Tara.
115	Can we use somewhere?
115	Rick
116	This is great.
116	I want to use it at our upcoming credit conference.
116	Thanks, Rick
117	My daughter has reservations at Kingsway House, 71 Eardley Court.
117	Can you see if anyone knows if this place is a disaster?
117	She is going with a girlfriend that doesn't have hardly any money so they had to find a place that was cheap which worries me no end.
117	Tx Rick
118	Yeah, I heard.
118	Childers informed me and rubbed it in that he was key in talking me out of that decision.
118	I think I made the right decision ya think?
118	Rick
119	fyi, rick
120	Maybe have her contact Ted since he is in London???
120	Rick
121	Craig, received another statement showing another service charge.
121	We should probably cancel this account.
121	Rick Buy
122	Maybe have her contact Ted since he is in London???
122	Rick
123	Please be sure this is in some legal record or something so I don't have problems with this in the future.
123	Thanks, Rick
124	Karen- please print this out and file somewhere.
124	tx rick
125	Thanks- I am very interested in this business so if I can help let me know.
125	Tx Rick
126	Please print and file tx rick
127	A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!!
127	We need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down.
127	This was the worst we have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard was going on there.
127	We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there isn't one already.
127	I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better.
127	More to come.
127	Rick
128	Ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly relieves me.
128	I did not want this procrastinated on.
128	I have a meeting scheduled with Rick Causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has transpired prior to that meeting.
128	Thanks for giving this your immediate attention.

129	Karen- please print this out and file somewhere.

130	The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001.
130	There was considerable discussion which I have summarized below.
130	Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk.
130	I answered positively, which is what the capital price addresses.
130	The dash return is a blended debt and equity return.(?) Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate.
130	I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.
130	Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon.
130	I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding.
130	We will have to watch this issue carefully.
130	Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem?
130	Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate.
130	This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp.
130	Rick
131	Please print and file tx rick
132	Thanks for your note.
132	I want to wish you the best of luck in EES.
132	As far as RAC's issues with EES, I would suggest getting together with Tribolet and getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task force.
132	I would also suggest attending the task force meeting, providing EES management is agreeable, to get a better picture of what is going on.
132	Again, I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and Enron.
132	Have fun!!
132	Rick
133	I liked him alot.
133	Seems ready, willing and able to make a move.
133	What are your thoughts?
133	Rick
134	Sounds fine to me.
134	Does it make sense to run resume past Brown and Sherriff prior to bringing him over?
134	Also, is the idea he would be a director, sr director or vp?
134	Each of these paths has consequences as you know.
134	Rick
135	Thanks for the feedback.
135	I sent my best guy there so I hope there is improvement.
135	We have been talking to a candidate for credit that Ted will be discussing with you soon.
135	Hopefully we can make progress there also.
135	I want complete buy in from you and John on this guy before we proceed.
135	Separately, the scrap metals meeting we had with Causey went well.
135	We will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are.
135	Thanks again for the feedback.
135	I was a little worried about Ted after the MD disappointment but it seems he has recovered.
135	Rick
136	thanks- now i just have to convince jeff-- rick
137	This is fine by me.
137	Rick Buy
138	Since my daughter is going over to London it prompted me to see if that would be a good time for me to come as well.
138	Then week of March 5.
138	I could stay a day or two if needed.
138	Any thoughts?

143	If you give me a brief description of what you are referring to I can forward to the correct person.
143	Thanks, R. Buy
144	Please include Bill Bradford if possible.
144	Tx Rick
145	Please include Bill Bradford if possible.
145	Tx Rick
146	This was an excellent response.
146	No need to take too much grief though.
146	Rick
147	Jeff- this guy sent me this email.
147	Probably not any interest to you, but you can decide.
147	Rick
148	This was an excellent response.
148	No need to take too much grief though.
148	Rick
149	Are you alive?
149	How is your health?
149	Is stress a big part of your life?
149	Hope all is well.
149	You are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be too much we'll try to help.
149	I noticed that west power has already made a fortune this year so it must be crazy.
149	Rick
150	You may have an interest in this.
150	FYI Rick
151	As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope.
151	Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time.
151	Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate.
151	Many will have to be multidimensional.
151	There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.
151	- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
151	- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues.
151	"De-silo-ization" .
151	- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
151	- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams.
151	- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
151	- Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues.
151	Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings.
151	- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio.
151	- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction.
151	Offer to help out if needed.
151	- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
151	- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
151	- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present.
151	This may take one quarter to implement.
151	- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor.
151	- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.
151	The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there.
151	You can have an impact.
151	This process should begin immediately.
151	Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.
151	Rick
152	You may have an interest in this.
152	FYI Rick
153	fyi, rick
154	fyi, rick
155	No further Board approval is required.
155	I'm told that new products on EOL require the lawyers to get involved but that will happen when you request to put the product online.
155	Rick
156	What do you think.
156	Probably ok I guess.
156	Rick
157	I'll be in New York.
157	They will have to fly solo on this.
157	Rick
158	Great news.
158	Thanks for the heads up.
158	Rick
159	What do you think.
159	Probably ok I guess.
159	Rick
160	I'll be in New York.
160	They will have to fly solo on this.
160	Rick
161	No problem publishing- fake numbers, fake names and the real deal was not done.
161	Should be pretty safe.
161	Rick
162	Great news.
162	Thanks for the heads up.
162	Rick
163	No- I'm meeting w/ Bradford at 11 to discuss.
163	Want to join us?
163	Rick
164	The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force.
164	The following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows: Legacy Opportunity Molly Harris Teresa Seibel James Copeland Michael Tribolet Jay Hachen Minal Dalia Don Rollins Rick Carson Jeff Soo Debbie Brackett Sue Vasan On Going Opportunities Denise Fury Mark Wilson Dana Smith Andrew Greer Martin O'leary Jay Hachen Dave Gorte Darren Schmidt David Port Jeff Soo This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it is necessary.
164	If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint Michael Tribolet to manage the task.
164	If you want someone else to manage the effort we will assist as we can.
164	Regardless of who leads this effort we need following: Commitment of EES back office staff people Commitment of IT resources Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.
164	Let me know how to launch this program.
164	Rick
165	fine by me, rick
166	No- I'm meeting w/ Bradford at 11 to discuss.
166	Want to join us?
166	Rick
167	fine by me, rick
168	fyi, rick
169	Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area.
169	Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting.
169	The concept is that a deal flows into a website??
169	that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped.
169	If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim.
169	Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D. and proceed to banks.
169	Ben is clearing idea with Delaney.
169	We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.
169	Thanks, Rick
170	fyi, rick
171	What conference?
171	Rick
172	need to know more.
172	focused on trading?
172	or assets?
172	rick
173	Was speaking w/ Lavo today on a different matter and he mentioned you were a great help to him in managing his world and was quite complementary overall.
173	I can count on one hand how often this happens in RAC so keep it up.
173	Great job.
173	Thanks, Rick
174	What conference?
174	Rick
175	need to know more.
175	focused on trading?
175	or assets?
175	rick
176	????????????????????????????????????????????
176	Rick
177	I attend a regular meeting with AA and Rick Causey discussing EES internal controls.
177	They have asked for a detailed presentation on : -EAM business -Tariff curve summary and positions against those curves -Credit issues in general.
177	I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and get it organized.
177	EES may attend but not present.
177	I think we should give them an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the above areas.
177	Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two.
177	Lets try to meet next week.
177	Karen- please set up.
177	Tx Rick
178	????????????????????????????????????????????
178	Rick
179	Can you guys make a meeting on March 12 at 10am to discuss something with above group?
179	Rick
180	I approve this request.
180	Thanks, Rick Buy
181	I approve this request.
181	Thanks, Rick Buy
182	Karen- please circulate to all RAC worldwide.
182	Tx Rick It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, manager in the Market Risk Group.
182	Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 and will have funeral services in Florida.
182	There may be a memorial service here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been announced.
182	Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.
182	Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a real impact especially on those that worked closely with him.
182	Andy had a warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made him a real asset to the group.
182	He will be missed.
183	Thanks for the information on the GB 58.
183	This boat far exceeds what I want.
183	After the show I concluded that either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs.
183	Would like to also consider the 36 foot model.
183	Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind.
183	I enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at most everything there in detail).
183	As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or used, I may be interested.
183	Again, I would need your help in obtaining appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!) Thanks, Rick Buy
184	Phone numbers for Ted Murphy, Anne=wife Work 020-778-35005 Home 020-7937-2051 Cell 78815-12144 They are very nice and are expecting you and Rebecca.
184	Feel free to ask them for advice, help or whatever.
184	If something happens and you need money I'll pay Ted back.
184	Have fun, Love Dad.
185	Wow!!
185	Quite the atricle.
185	Great job.
185	You should publish it in business week or fortune.
185	Thanks for sending me a copy.
185	Rick Buy
186	ted fyi, rick
187	It is critical that RAC speak as one here.
187	Be sure to coordinate with Tribolet and Hachen on this stuff.
187	Rick
188	fyi, rick
189	no problemo rick
190	I like this.
190	Tx Rick
191	I may have caused some confusion regarding a credit person in New York.
191	Karen left me a message that a new credit person in NY had started and wanted to meet me since she was in Houston.
191	Turns out it was Bridgett Frazer who Bryan hired for Credit.com.
191	Sorry for confusion.
191	Rick
192	yes, assuming you don't have an objection.
192	i thought you were attending these meetings already but there are so many of them i get confused.
192	rick
193	yes, tx rick
194	Stephanie- can you fax this guy a blank dash.
194	Tx Rick
195	The names on this list seem very expensive to me.
195	Do we really need this council?
195	Rick Buy
196	please put this on my calendar.
196	tx rick
197	no, rick
198	Wanted to apologize for running out on you in our meeting in London.
198	Unfortunately, you just can't keep Frevert waiting, especially when he wants to have a beer.
198	Lets catch up when you are in Houston.
198	Rick
199	Elizabeth- I think it best that at this stage I opt out of this engagement.
199	The situation I described to you is looking more and more like it is going to happpen and there is a real possibility I am totally engaged by the time this conference comes around.
199	I am sorry if this poses a problem for you but there should be plenty of time to arrange an alternate.
199	Rick
200	Agree- thats what I thought when I met with her over there.
200	Why don't you give her a call and try to arrange something.
200	One thing I would rather not pay any relocation expenses since she is moving on her own accord.
200	Have Suttle call her also.
200	Tx Rick
201	I think we will try to want to make this work for you.
201	Bill Bradford and/or John Suttle will be contacting you.
201	Tx Rick Buy
202	Karen- talked to Whalley on this.
202	He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people.
202	So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere.
202	A big concern Enron has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets.
202	You need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time.
202	Rick
203	Tim- Thanks for your note.
203	Before Janet D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place.
203	We have assigned Tracy Ngo, Ed Sacks, Paul Radous and Wendy Conwell to power.
203	We also have moved other RAC people into credit, Mark Ruane (VP), Ken Curry (Dir), and Carol North (Mgr).
203	Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly.
203	We are in the market for more.
203	It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market.
203	Tracy is one of our best people.
203	Also, does being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland.
203	I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in Houston and get her views as well.
203	Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the Enron curve.
203	Thanks, Rick
204	Ted- I gave my pass to Mark Frevert who was going to return it for me.
204	I guess he didn't.
204	I'll leave him a message.
204	Rick
205	Norm Tourangeau of B of A Please call re collateral Tx, Rick
206	Here is an application for George when he retires.
206	Rick
207	I see no reason not to except they rotate out in a year.
207	Maybe we could have them rotate to another group in RAC.
207	We need bodies so my vote would be to take him if he passes our test.
207	Rick
208	I'm in. Maybe we could form a committee so Mark could be on it.
208	He could even chair it if he was up to it.
208	Regards, Rick Buy Executive Vice President Chief Risk Officer and member of VP PRC Committee Enron Corp.
209	thats really below the belt
210	I think it would be best if we sent a team to you office for a day or two.
210	If we did it here it would be difficult to get people's attention for anything other than a minute.
210	Let me know your thoughts.
210	Rick
211	I didn't realize everything was here.
211	Lets set a date and get after it.
211	Rick
212	fyi, rick
213	fyi, rick
214	probably not worth the time.
214	i think it is kind of a rehearsal.
214	rick
215	Do you guys think these meetings are still necessary?
215	Rick (I don't)
216	fyi- we need to discuss, rick
217	I left Skilling a message on this.
217	Lets see what he has to say.
217	Rick
218	Rudi- I still have a hard time visualizing the risk here, other than pure dilution, which I guess we care about.
218	There must be a way to communicate this issue graphically or with an example presented on a well thought out spreadsheet.
218	If you (we) don't figure out a way to communicate the problem here we have no chance of winning the battle.
218	Rick
219	We can help you interview.
219	Bradford and Port can really help in this process but its best if you screen them first.
219	As far as dates go we have an Enron BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us.
219	This meeting is in early May, so after mid April it starts to get crazy.
219	It would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate.
219	Rick
220	Spoke with Louise Kitchen on another matter but unprompted she mentioned she really valued the watch list work as well as the snapshot effort.
220	She actually raved about the whole effort.
220	Keep up the good work and let the group know it is valued.
220	Now just do it faster and more efficiently so you can do other stuff as well!!!
220	Rick
221	thanks for checking- it is unusual that they post interest daily.
221	rick
222	Shawn- thanks for info.
222	We have done a lot on retail credit effort and should probably have a meeting to update everyone.
222	I'll try to set something up.
222	Rick
223	Thank-you for your prompt response.
223	R. Buy
224	Probably unnecessary to attend regularly from my point of view but I have no issue either way.
224	I think it is a good idea to meet monthly with Causey.
224	Rick
225	We have received a request to change UK power limit from $12.6MM VAR to $35MM.
225	Quite sizeable but I spoke with Richard Lewis and he seemed convinced it was necessary.
225	Do you guys agree?
225	What if it were $20MM?
225	Skilling will definitely ask why such a large increase so I need to have your full support.
225	Rick
226	I believe the following series of emails is a colossal waste of time.
226	Lets get risks into books, risk systems working, options valued and into books.It seems we are trying to build a race car when there are no roads.
226	Rick
227	I think they will get the point.
227	Rick
228	This is the site.
228	It refers to other sites.
228	Rick
229	Attached is the list Karen gave me for the PRC members.
229	Seems like a long list.
229	Can we shorten?
229	If not I guess it is ok, it will just take longer and be harder to reach consensus.
229	Rick
230	Better get after this quickly.
230	Are we working on this already?
230	Rick
231	This is a good article, on balance.
231	Interesting how utilities have charged the highest rates.
231	Tx, Rick
232	How does this list sound for committee.
232	Bradford Carson Lowry Petersen Murphy Davies Port Schultz Buy Let me know.
232	Tx.
232	Rick
233	Good ideas.
233	I want to meet with all groups soon to see how progress is going.
233	Will start scheduling soon.
233	Rick
234	Dick Foster is a consultant to the Board of Directors who works for Mckenzie.
234	Each BOD meeting he wants to meet with a group and we are on the list.
234	I talked to Rebecca Carter and suggested we present him the bank presentation and she thought that was a good idea.
234	Please make yourself available for this.
234	Ted - if you can stay an extra day it would be helpful but not essential if you need to get back.
234	Let me know.
234	Tx Rick
235	I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues.
235	I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well.
235	I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday.
235	Can the RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.
235	Thanks, Rick
236	Sally- got your voice mail as well.
236	Don't want to create more meetings.
236	Just had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk.
236	I think it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are identified.
236	It may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested.
236	I need to hear what the nature of the problems are.
236	Some I know like ees, metals, uk power but I think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hindering progress here.
236	No need for you to attend.
236	I will let you know what we come up with including if there are no issues at all!
236	Rick
237	Recall that Jeff had several requests when we met with him.
237	I asked you to write them down.
237	Did you?
237	Have we done all of them?
237	Can you give me an update?
237	Tx Rick
238	good
239	Why are we paying someone to do this?
239	I think we should transfer Keith to credit full time and put his analysis capabilities to use.
239	Rick
240	We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board for approval.
240	I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger.
240	My understanding is that there is an IT and backoffice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to complete.
240	Please keep the pressure on over there to get the infrastructure where it needs to be.
240	Thanks, Rick
241	Is this the deal you referenced at the exec comm (B) meeting ?
241	Or is there another one.
241	I asked my guys to check if we had seen deal.
241	Rick
242	fyi, they forgot you!
242	rick
243	My vote would be to initiate a claim, as I want to see if it works and how much hassle is involved.
243	We should have a meeting to get everyone's view.
243	I will get Karen to set up.
243	Tx Rick (Karen- please set up a half hour mtg w/ Causey, Bill, Glisan and Jeff Hodge. Time sensitive so we need in next couple days. Tx Rick
244	Bill-I asked Joe to put this together.
244	fyi, Rick.
244	Fwd to Molly
245	thanks for the note.
245	these events aren't cheap so it is nice to know they are worth while to some.
245	rick
246	these files are password protected.
246	what is this for?
246	rick
247	why?
248	fyi- rick
249	Blaise- I have distributed your resume internally to a couple places.
249	We have no people needs right now, (just the opposite), but maybe one of the other groups does.
249	Will let you know if anything pops.
249	Rick
250	Since you are in charge of career development- I want to be President, soon.
250	Seriously, you should probably meet with me or some of the group leaders in RAC so you have a clear picture (in case you don't) of what we do.
250	I'd be happy to meet with you as would Dave Gorte.
250	Let me know if this would be valuable for you.
250	Tx Rick
251	The city buys power?
251	Has PA been downgraded due to dot com flops?
251	Rick
252	Good job!
252	Reserve is low, historically speaking.
252	Rick
253	I will think about it.
253	We are achieving the correct outcome here but the timing is off.
253	Concentrate on Caulfield and Oman.
253	Get Brown involved to make sure we get those guys.
253	Use Ene options as a currency to entice them.
253	Upside much better than Chase/JP.
253	Just a thought.
253	Rick
254	Ted, my comments are indicated below.
255	I am on the Board of Mariner and attended a Board meeting last week discussing company.
255	They are looking as good as I've seen them since the inception of the deal.
255	It might be a good time to consider selling.
255	Probably still couldn't get it off at book but closer than ever before.
255	Just a thought.
255	(As if you didn't have anything else to do.) Rick
256	As with muni bonds, it is nice to be able to just raise taxes to cover your costs.
256	(Unless you are the taxpayer).
256	Tx for update, Rick
257	looks good to me.
257	jeff may want to just sign deals quickly without explanation as he does often on dashes.
257	rick
258	do you want to talk to this lady?
258	i don't.
258	rick
259	No interest in participating.
259	As you can imagine Enron gets a large number of similar requests and I have adopted a policy of not cooperating, purely from a time management standpoint.
259	Sorry, Rick Buy
260	Can you help here?
260	Rick
261	I will look into this.
261	Get back to you soon Rick
262	Can we discuss this?
262	Rick
263	No, I already told her there was no interest at Enron.
263	No need to pursue.
263	Rick
264	I hate to ask you to make yet another trip.
264	However, there is probably nothing more important right now given markets view of us as a trading company.
264	?Let me check w/ Despain on pulse here.
264	Get back to you.
264	Rick
265	EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide information to us in a timely and accurate fashion.
265	(I wish I could get the rest of the company to this point).
265	I'm told that the people referenced below have contributed in a big way to this effort.
265	Thanks for the effort.
265	Rick
266	Will be out of town.
266	Thanks anyway.
266	Rick
267	Heard back from Tim.
267	Please plan on attending.
267	Port, Bradford, you and I will attend from RAC.
267	Moody's is having trouble with our loss of $694MM that I told them when they were here.
267	We need to start pulling together explicitly why we lost so much in one day, what the var limits were that day and what has been the experience since then.
267	Tx Rick
268	i would like more detail if we have it tx rick
269	David Port should be contacting you shortly.
269	We are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting.
269	I don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so the allocation becomes critical.
269	Should be an interesting discussion.
269	More to come.
269	Rick
270	Were we involved in transaction?
270	Did we run any numbers.
270	Were we at the meeting with Skilling?
270	Was corporate development involved?
270	Who?
270	Rick
271	tx, rick
272	thanks for heads up.
272	i will let you know how meeting goes.
272	rick

273	Can you?
273	Call Karen to schedule.
273	Tx Rick
274	meeting was postponed because whalley going to london.
274	need next week.
274	tx rick
275	looks good to me.
275	rick
276	Is this who you were going to consult for?
276	Rick
277	Looks fine to me.
277	No comments.
277	Rick
278	We seem to have resolved billing/account difficulties.
278	Would like to talk to you about setting up a system to manage cash so it can be in place and functional when I decide I have had enough of this place.
278	Give me a call next week if you can.
278	Thanks, Rick
279	Vlady- you may have to do this for me as I will be in NYC the day before with Moody's and there is a chance I will be delayed.
279	We should develop what we want to say together so either of us can speak.
279	Tx Rick
280	Dave- we can act as a check on this.
280	Be sure all underwriters are aware.
280	Tx Rick
281	This looks great.
281	Send it out.
281	Rick
282	Just between you and I, I think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities.
282	We can't have that in your group or mine.
282	I'll watch carefully.
282	On the subject of timing, we should probably have a standard to shoot for.
282	Time to read contract, run model, review results and communicate.
282	I'll talk to Bill about this.
282	On the issue of the hotline, we do not have everyone trained in running models for EES deals.
282	We are working on getting more people up to speed.
282	Thanks, Rick
283	Will you take a stab at this w/ Hughes.
283	Rick
284	Jim- J Block was just a gas contract.
284	At Enron, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash.
284	No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries.
284	Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book.
284	Rick
285	Lets discuss this.
285	Rick
286	They need to post more cash.
286	Let me know.
286	Maybe a call to Cronin.
286	Rick
287	Bill- fyi, Rick
288	Billy- would like to attend but will be out of town.
288	Rick
289	more pressure.
289	rick
290	I would like to attend this as well.
290	Rick (Unless it would be disruptive)
291	do you guys think this is worthwhile?
291	i think it might be interesting to see what others are doing.
291	$75k rick
292	fyi, rick
293	Bill- can you attend a joint ews/ees coordination mtg on the 18th.
293	Will be all day.
293	Janet wants either you or I there but I have Spec Tech PRC that day.
293	Can't delegate it.
293	Rick
294	yes, i may attend in the am before the prc.
294	rick
295	Thanks for note.
295	Sounds like good progress on people side.
295	It seems, like many things, that a huge effort is followed by a period of nothing, but eventually the balls that have been rolling generate enuf "mo" to make a difference.
295	Rick
296	Thanks for note.
296	I recall our conversation.
296	I've had surgery but as you know the worry is did they get it all?
296	Surface tissue of tongue on bottom right.
296	This is so weird since I don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk factors.
296	Thanks for your concern and I will let you know how this goes.
296	I have found that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyone.
296	I go back to MDA in a month for follow-up visit (ultra sound of lymph nodes).
296	Rick
297	OK but this is a tree and I want to focus on the forest.
297	A few facts on this may be helpful to understand the forest.
297	Also, be sure to coordinate with Ted on London stuff.
297	Tx Rick
298	Lets cancel for the moment.
298	Bring up at next staff meeting.
298	Rick
299	Karen- please set up a meeting on this with Bill B and whoever he wants to attend.
299	Next week if possible.
299	Tx Rick
300	Tx, Rick
301	Thanks for note.
301	I may need your help here as I won't be able to filter stuff as much as I usually do so if my guys are reviewing something that looks way off let me know.
301	Also, spoke with Pug re joint meeting and he nthinks we need 2 hours for it and probably won't be able to discuss international assets and lessons learned this time around.Is there anyway we can increase time for joint meeting to 2 hours, and have audit and finance as well?
301	Pug really wants to leave adequate time to discuss limits etc. He also wants to be sure that all BOD feel they are invited.
301	How do we do that?
301	Rick
302	At least you know you are out of control.
302	That is partial success.
302	Thanks for note.
302	Rick
303	looks ok to me- rick
304	Whats up with this comment??
304	Rick
305	i think i did this properly.
305	any way you can check?
305	rick
306	What is status of this?
306	Rick
307	Maybe we need to rethink entire process.
307	I haven't been totally comfortable with it anyway but it hasn't been high enuf on the list.
307	Maybe after BOD mtg.
307	Rick
308	Did this lady contact you?
308	Rick
309	A great tool, launched from the right platform.
309	We are definitely making progress around here.
309	Keep it up.
309	Rick
310	Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood "Allison".
310	All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded.
310	The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries.
310	Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.
310	The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation.
310	These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services.
310	The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-wheels per day.
310	Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals.
310	I encourage every single employee to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort.
310	RAC's goal is 100% participation.
310	It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.
310	Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions.
310	Please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsibilities.
310	Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.
310	Let's show everyone that RAC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.
310	Rick Enron Corp. Day of Caring RAC Representatives: Cassandra Schultz and Rebecca Phillips RAC Day of Caring Team Leaders: Underwriting: Cindy Hudler Credit Risk: Darren Vanek Market Risk: Rita Hennessy Portfolio Management: Becky Caudle Compliance: Shelli Smith
311	I didn't see where she said it was mismarked.
311	I have been seeing your comments on this validation process and I do think we (RAC) can improve here.
311	I've asked David Port to dig in and make some recommendations.
311	Rick
312	Great job and great team.
312	Stick to your guns going forward.
312	Rick
313	Today WSJ article on page 1 is good example of what we try to capture.
313	They weren't MTM'ing their junk bond portfolio and it went against them.
313	They were also trying to increase earnings by taking on more risk, without the risk system in place.
313	They fired cfo and are looking for a risk person!!
313	Good reading.
313	FYI, Rick
314	Approve as written.
314	Rick
315	She needs a higher prc rating for an office.
315	rick
316	David - I already apprised Whalley of this issue.
316	He is thinking about it.
316	Rick
317	As we discussed, please verify or have verified by IT, the email and calendar access of Ted Murphy relative to Veronica Valdez.
317	Have all such access disconnected if you find it connected.
317	Thanks, Rick Buy
318	fyi, rick
319	Great!!!!.
319	Rick
320	Great.
320	If we have any inkling of a sale it should probably be mentioned at this BOD meeting.
320	We can call an executive committee when an actual approval is required but August can be real tough with vacations.
320	Thanks for update.
320	Rick
321	Any interest?
321	Rick
322	FYI Hope this helps.
322	Rick
323	As you are now aware, the United Way Campaign has now kicked-off and RAC is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place.
323	First of all, Monday morning, each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week.
323	The building blocks symbolize Enron's commitment to "Building Houston's Future" with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community.
323	To highlight this week's activities: On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 Enron Days of Caring.
323	The Enron Corporate Team, of which RAC is a large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center.
323	If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you.
323	If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators--Cindy Hudler, Rebecca Phillips, Darren Vanek, Shelli Smith, Becky Caudle, Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider.
323	On Friday, August 10, Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week.
323	Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around Enron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team.
323	Please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.
323	Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.
323	This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison.
323	In addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm.
323	A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need.
323	Remember approximately $0.90 out of every $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens in the Houston area.
323	I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective of 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution.
323	Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources website at Thanks for your support.
323	Best regards, Rick
324	Unfortunately, I will be on vacation.
324	Dave Gorte in my group would be a good candidate to attend if you think appropriate.
324	Tx, Rick Buy
325	After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion: 1.
325	We should shut these offices down because we can not control them.
325	They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.
325	---or---- 2.
325	We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate.
325	My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation.
325	Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules.
325	"Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.
325	There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.
325	Any thoughts?
325	Rick
326	Sounds interesting but I am sort of long people at the moment.
326	I bet Fastow could use him.
326	Rick
327	fyi, rick
328	Looks accurate to me.
328	Rick Buy
329	Jeff, sorry about the meeting but BOD meeting is next week and we all have to jump for it.
329	Rick
330	Glad to help.
330	Good luck- seemed like a tough crowd.
330	Rick
331	Any news here?
331	Rick
332	There is a lot of heat building on this.
332	Where are we now.
332	Rick
333	tx, rick
334	Will be on vacation but wish MK the best of luck.
334	Rick
335	I would like to extend my appreciation to you and all who contributed to the preparation of the Audit, Finance (and combined) meetings books, policies, simulations, calculations and machinations involved in this effort.
335	It was huge.
335	I would be happy to sponsor a happy hour if anyone is interested.
335	I will not be able to attend but would love to.
335	Please pass along to all in group.
335	I will be out after today's meetings for a while but I can be reached and I will occasionally check email and voice mail.
335	Rick
336	fyi, rick
337	I agree.
337	Given that Andy's world is expanding (corp dev) he may be even less accessible.
337	I'll discuss with Andy and Ben.
337	Rick
338	Any issues?
338	Rick
339	Had a miscommunication.
339	I will talk to Janus.
339	What should I say?
339	Rick
340	fyi- is nymex in world trade bldg?
340	rick
341	Was out of town but back now.
341	I asked my group to look at your note and apprise me.
341	Will let you know when they do.
341	Tx Rick
342	fyi, rick
343	I haven't done any feedback on anyone and I don't know how and I have a good excuse.
343	If Sheila teaches me this week I will do it.
343	Tx Rick
344	Mr. Fleming: Thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information.
344	Your letter indicated that I should make application through the Membership Committee, who would provide me with an application.
344	You copied Cmde.
344	Roth on the letter so I will contact him to request an application or schedule a meeting.
344	(I have no contact information for him other than through the PYC, is that appropriate?) I found a potential slip at Great Cove Boat Club and was wondering if you had heard of this marina and if other members used this facility.
344	Thanks again for getting back to me.
344	Richard (Rick) Buy P.S.
344	I heard on the news one of the pilots was from Portsmouth.
344	So tragic.
344	I'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here.
345	i don't like this.
345	we must make a decision.
345	rick
346	yes
347	Input is fine.
347	You will have your hands full at tnpc.
347	rick
348	Was Reilly crawling home when he saw you at the underpass?
348	Be happy to get together either in office or breakfast/lunch.
348	Give me a call.
348	Rick
349	I get snail mail and file the statements.
349	You should too.
349	You can view your account online, with a password, but keep getting written confirmations and statements.
349	You never know if a plane might crash into their computers.
349	Love, Dad (A time will come when you don't need paper but I don't think we are there yet.)
350	I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list.
350	Here it is: Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson Private Equity Trading-Gorte Credit Consistency study- Buy I think we should have a meeting to discuss above.
350	Some are bigger than others.
350	Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment.
350	If anything else belongs on this list let me know.
350	Karen will set up meeting.
350	Rick
351	no
352	no, we have the rac seats for all of these games right?
352	rick
353	Thanks for help.
353	This is a tremendous service you guys provide.
353	R. Buy
354	I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment.
354	It does not sound like this lady has her act together.
354	I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers.
354	You should talk to the head of the dept.
354	and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached.
354	Don't worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant.
354	Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant.
354	There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot.
354	You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major.
354	My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this.
354	The first stop should be the head of the department.
354	Lets talk more on this topic.
354	Love, Dad
355	help!!!
356	fyi,pls handle tx rick
357	agree- there should be no issue whatsoever getting him promoted at ye rick
358	FYI Rick
359	fyi, rick
360	I worked there for 4 years, including the 93 bomb incident.
360	This whole thing is beyond my imaginations ability to comprehend.
360	Rick
361	My name is Rick Buy and I saw your note in Points East magazine indicating you could take on some new members.
361	This sounds terrific to me.
361	Are there still "opening"s?
361	I own a 25 foot Boston Whaler, am new to the area, and would like to meet some nice people and would like to join others on a cruise occasionally.
361	My wife, Janice, likes boating as well but neither of us owns an ascot.
361	I would love to give you a call and discuss this but I thought I would write this email first.
361	Rick
362	I can't believe you finally got Vlady.
362	You must have snuck in while I was on vacation.
362	By the way, Whalley, Port and I talked and decided we would try removing all your limits except var.
362	Lets see how it works.
362	Rick
363	Does anyone ask how the reserve is split between deals?
363	Also, do they ask is it can be reduced because of portfolio effect?
363	Just curious.
363	Rick
364	Good job.
364	Recoveries down sharply in '01 due to???
364	Rick
365	Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio.
365	I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with.
365	Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss?
365	Rick
366	fyi, lets have a mtg.
367	I will attend both events.
367	Tx, Rick
368	Ask Port.
368	It was in an appendix to finance comm book.
368	2 mtgs ago i think.
368	it had pug's q&a as well.
368	Port will know what I'm talking about.
368	Rick
369	Thanks, I'll keep in mind.
369	Its unfortunate we have to develop expertise in this area.
369	Rick
370	fyi??
370	rick
371	fyi, we are considering buying a server.
371	rick
372	Have fun.
372	You guys do a great job on the reporting info for BOD and it is appreciated.
372	Rick
373	very good thought.
373	i'll pursue.
373	tx rick
374	lets discuss need gorte as well.
374	rick
375	fyi- this sound familiar?
375	rick
376	So noted.
376	Watch is a defined term in our system but doesn't mean you don't "watch" everything else.
376	So long, and may all your investments remain "performing".
376	Rick
377	Why would they already have received "funds".
377	Rick
378	Tx.
378	I often wonder if all reserve amounts agreed to find there way to the general ledger reserve.
378	Rick
379	I had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encouraged by the report.
379	Seems like real good progress on all fronts.
379	As400 systems work, var implementation and trading results all seemed positive.
379	Some issues around SAP/AS400 reconciliation but recognized.
379	Metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list.
379	Great work to your team.
379	Rick
380	i think i would to attend the weekly meeting with haedicke.
380	can you get me invited?
380	tx rick
381	fyi, any thoughts?
381	rick
382	have fun
383	We should meet next week and discuss who is doing what to who in your group.
383	I have lost track of some of the names.
383	Nice update, thanks.
383	Rick
384	Ted- I am taking 10-18-01 off.
384	I'll have my cell phone if needed.
384	I informed McMahon about Bali Klockner.
384	He was unaware of issue.
384	Rick
385	fyi- don't forward to anyone.
385	Rick
386	John- I received this and have no idea as to its origin.
386	Do with as you will.
386	Rick
387	Thanks.
387	Hopefully we will have some sort of official statement today to restore confidence.
387	Tough situation.
387	Rick
388	fyi thoughts?
388	rick
389	Joe - should I get some lunch ordered?
389	Rick
390	We need to talk today on what we say to ctpies.
390	AES called for $50 million and Louise wants to keep them happy.
390	Others are slowly restricting us in various ways.
390	We need a story.
390	Rick
391	Joe- Where is liquidity group meeting.
391	My group wants to spend some time with them and then reconvene with us to discuss book position s.
391	Rick 3-4739
392	Glad it was worthwhile for you.
392	We'll have more.
392	Rick
393	starting to.
393	rick
394	This is not fun.
394	Rick
395	Please ring Draper at AEP Current position: We have paid them all of the margin they have contractual rights for - $33.5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract.
395	However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is being driven by Bill Reid on their power floor -ex Enron employee), the amount is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this).
395	Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated.
395	I believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to.
395	Louise Tel 011447778757656 (care of Rick's email)
396	good.
396	my personal email is ourternrbb@aol.com tx rick
397	Thanks for invitation but I had better hang loose during this crisis.
397	Keep me in mind in the future.
397	Thanks Rick Buy
398	can't make investment recommendations, but maybe we can go in on a duplex in south louisiana.
398	we could be investment advisors to shrimpers.
398	what a mess.
398	see ya rick
399	Hi Jule- thought about your comment about Fidelity.
399	You need to get those checks and monthly statements.
399	Call them and tell them to get that stuff to you.
399	Don't call the jerk.
399	Call the 800 number.
399	You should carefully manage your money.
399	It is very important.
399	Love, Dad.
400	Please circ to all of RAC.
400	I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times.
400	Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these.
400	Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC.
400	Congratulations to all.
400	On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups.
400	Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people.
400	We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.
400	Things are not back to normal but they are improving.
400	Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved.
400	Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions.
400	In the mean time, keep smiling.
400	Rick
401	Bill should have copied you.
401	Fyi, Rick
402	Looks fine to me.

406	As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks.
406	This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need.
406	You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.
406	In the meantime, lets get back to work.
406	I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel "angst".
406	Rick
407	Bank deal happened.
407	Hopefully we can return to "normal" (asylum) now.
407	I imagine AF is not enjoying any beach right now.
407	Thanks for the laugh.
407	Rick
408	Amusing attachment.
408	Rick
409	Thought you might like the attachment.
409	Love, Dad
410	Ray- Steel group wants to purchase $15.3 million per month of steel for 3 years.
410	It appears this deal is creating inventory (no offsetting short).
410	Do you have any thoughts on this as acting head of EIM?
410	Doesn't sound like the best use of our liquidity at this point.
410	Rick (We have a million issues to address like this around the company).
411	Is this ok with policy?
411	rick
412	I will attend in person.
412	Rick
413	Hi I'm in the Board Meeting buy shoudn't last muchlonger.
413	Love, me.
413	Rick Buy
414	I'm in a Board meeting sending you an email on my new Skytell pager.
414	Are you feeling better.
414	Hope so.
414	I better go Love, Dad Rick Buy
415	6:15 and still going but shouldBeDoneBy 6:30 Rick Buy
416	We are trying to get the banks out of our hair a little bit here so let me know if there are any more requests for info and don't send anything to them without clearing it with me first.
416	I will run sensitive stuff past Lavo and then try to let the banks know they have enough know.
416	They are calling people directly now and we need to stop that.
416	Thanks, Rick
417	Are there lots more.
417	If not, $2.5 million is not Whalley level discussion.
417	Same point as we discussed this am.
417	Rick
418	We can not have this going on at this time.
418	Someone needs to negotiate for Enron.
418	Lets discuss.
418	Rick
419	I don't know that we have to cover all of this but we should meet today to get a start on this.
419	Rick
420	This is ok with me.
420	They have requested it.
420	We only need director and above.
420	Rick
421	I,m in a meeting til noon.
421	Did you differ from me.
421	Rick Rick Buy
422	We are not having a particularly good day here.
422	We need some good news to share.
422	Any updates please pass along asap.
422	Tx Rick
423	Thanks Rick Buy
424	Meeting at 6:30.
424	Will let you know after that.
424	Your ruler, Richard Buy
425	There is now a meeting at 8pm as well.
425	Forget dinner.
425	What a mess.
425	See you later.
425	Love, me.
425	Rick Buy
426	Still waiting on decision.
426	You haven't seen 120 in some time.
426	Rick Buy
427	Jeff Delapino (sp?) from Chase has asked me to look into the above transaction to change from monthly collateralization to daily.
427	Do you know who is familiar with this deal?
427	Rick
428	Lets do what we can.
428	It does sound like it would be less volatile if settled daily.
428	Rick
429	I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk.
429	Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK.
429	I have two suggestions: -allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity or -appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.
429	For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch.
429	We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast.
429	I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow.
429	Rick
430	I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap.
430	I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else.
430	Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement.
430	If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts?
430	If you have no issues I will proceed.
430	Thanks, Rick
431	Effective immediately, I want to sign all Dashes for RAC.
431	I have asked Dave to continue reviewing the deals and initial the Dash but I want to sign them.
431	This will enable me to be more on top of transactions and also allow me to relate to the other things that are going on.
431	Thanks for your cooperation.
431	Rick
432	can you explain this to me?
432	tx rick
433	I can comment on trade behavior and margin if appropriate.
433	Rick
434	Mary- attached is the non password protected version.
434	This is the bare bones list of people I need, which is a 47% reduction.
434	Also included is a list of recommended bonuses to keep some of them.
434	Let me know if it meets your needs.
434	I will modify it any way your heart desires.
434	Rick
435	Does this impact our discussion of yesterday?
435	By the way, Richard Sanders was very helpful in helping me deal with this.
435	Rick
436	Bill- I have revised presentation.
436	Do you want to see it again?
436	Rick
437	Greg- we plan to counter at indicated discount.
437	Let me know if you disagree.

439	Rick Rick Buy

440	Is Cassandra there today?
440	Rick Rick Buy

441	Rick
442	This is what you are talking about?
442	Rick
443	fyi- I don't feel we have tight coordination on info xfer to these guys.
443	I have scheduled a meeting to discuss.
443	rick
444	Any thoughts on this?
444	Rick
445	Took a call from Bill Cronin at New Power today.
445	He requested that they be able to deal with commercial customers that were off limits before, ie medium commercial or large commercial.
445	He also mentioned that they may have an interesty in some of the people.
445	Any thoughts?
445	Rick
446	thanks for note.
446	laid off two thirds of staff on monday.
446	have learned a tremendous amount and may go on lecture circuit.

452	Lyn- I was good to meet with you on Thursday.
452	Its amazing how similar our issues are and the approaches we use to address them.
452	I spoke with my wife and we concluded it is probably a great idea to pursue something outside of Enron so I would definitely like to continue our discussions if you think appropriate.
452	Look forward to talking to you further.
452	Thanks, Rick Buy
453	Thanks good job.
453	You can Explain this to me next week or overthe weekend.

454	If you have any follow up comments don't hesitate to call.
454	Rick Buy Rick Buy
455	Jim- Please add Michael Tribolet to EIM lead position for RAC.
455	I will have a little crossover due to skill sets which I assume is ok, you really just need a lead to coordinate and manage the process.
455	Lets meet on Monday.
455	Can someone that is in Netco also be one of these coordinators?
455	Rick
456	My office is fine.
456	We will still meet prior to that as scheduled I presume.
456	I also would like a debriefing on Friday's hearing.
456	Thanks Rick Buy
457	fyi what is this???
457	rick
458	As we go into a possible deal with someone on Netco, we need to screen info transmitted to parties carefully and try to not send something if possible.
458	If we need to transmit info out lets review it before it goes.
458	Lavo or one of his people may want to review as well.
458	Thanks Rick
459	Fine my me.

481	Scott- I discussed the sale of Mariner's deepwater assets with Dave Gorte and he confirmed that any sale would require both creditors committee and bankruptcy court approval prior to consummation of the deal.
481	We don't believe there would be any issue with the sale.

490	Rick Rick Buy
491	It has been unreal.
491	Would like to catch up.
491	I may need a job!
491	Looks like UBS has bought our trading operation which includes me for the moment anyway.
491	Hope all is well on your end.
491	Rick
492	Congrats!!!!
492	Rick
493	Looks great.
493	Is it a fraternity or sorority.
493	Love, Dad PS Mom is home.
494	Janet - thanks for your note.
494	Following are my thoughts.
494	First, I am not going to Netco.
494	(Long story).
494	Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it.
494	They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively).
494	Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand.
494	I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28.
494	We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.
494	My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical.
494	I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team.
494	Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people.
494	I hope this addresses your issue.
494	Rick
495	Louise- We need to get Netco people and UBS off the floor on 28.
495	It is demoralizing to the remaining estate people and I am having a huge problem keeping people in their seats.
495	Three have quit this week and we need the ones that remain.
495	Can you make this happen rapidly?
495	Thanks, Rick
496	Unfortunately I will be talking with the SEC next week.
496	If you think Dave Gorte could help in this feel free to invite him to your meeting.
496	Rick
497	I should have sent a copy of this to you as well.
497	FYI Rick
498	Do I want to be represented by someone named lawless?
498	Rick Rick Buy
499	How so.
499	I have tried my best over the years to improve deal quality to an audience that usually told me that I was irrelevant.
499	Suggest you get facts before judging anyone.
499	Rick Rick Buy
500	I am in Washington all week (until Friday) but may be available by phone.
500	Rick Rick Buy
501	Sounds good to me.
501	I'm out of office til Wed.
501	Trip was good I presume?
501	Rick Rick Buy
502	I just found a sympathy card from Karen Heathman in my briefcase.
502	Let me know when you get this.
502	I am getting the feeling that these messages don't get through.
502	Love, me.
502	Rick Buy
503	I am available but I know almost nothing about the Dynegy case.
503	Rick
504	Jim- Do you have a list of who I talked to in Houston and their affiliation.
504	I would like to keep straight who I have spoken with.
504	The only card I received is from Michael Geffroy.
504	Let me know if there is a problem with this request.
504	Thanks, Rick Buy
505	I think we do not need Board Approval, but they should be notified at the next meeting.
505	I believe I discussed this with Pug and that is what we concluded.
505	Therefore, we need a new DASH and a quick summary of transaction which would include changes from original deal.
505	Rick
506	Lets discuss when you have a minute.
506	Rick
507	Retained- Houston office.
507	Tx, Rick
508	will do.
508	i keep losing people though so it changes the landscape.
508	rick
509	fyi, please send org chart, tx rick
510	accidently sent this to you rather than my person that handles org charts.
510	she will send to you RAC org chart asap.

7	No, Mark is going to Portland, and he just left.
7	You got our picks on Friday right?
7	I also need Karen Taylor's phone number, she's hot for me again.
7	I rally like her little assistant Laura.
8	What's up you two losers, and I mean losers!
8	Anyway, since I have to take time out of my busy schedule and lower myself to your standards here is my itinerary so pay close attention.

8	I'll give them a credit card when I get there.
8	One of the rooms has a King only and the other room has two beds but it's a smoking room, that's all they had.
8	So smoke um if you got um!
8	Both rooms have an additional pull out bed, FYI.
8	I'm looking forward to this weekend, go UT!!!!!!!!!!
8	Your Master Paul PS I haven't been going to the gym since I started getting laid by this girl.
9	What do you mean bummer, didn't you pick Oakland?
9	How was Teddy's?
10	I will talk to Theresa and Gerald.
10	I'm sorry for all the confusion and will get back to you ASAP.
10	Paul
11	Once again, HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!
12	Barry, Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation; Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.
12	They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.
12	They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
12	Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
12	Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.
12	I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.
12	As new information develops I will pass it on.
12	Paul
13	I called the airline there has been a change of schedule: New Flight Information: Airline: Same (United) Airport: DFW Time: 1:00 pm (arrive DFW) Make note, if there are any screw ups heads will roll.
13	Paul PS Don't make me wait, NO ONE MAKES ME WAIT!!!
14	Looks like you and I will hang out and wait for Will.
14	I told Mike we will be at the airport so we can pick everyone up who comes in around these times.
14	Are you getting these emails?
15	We can cover the airport so you don't have too.
15	Just tell everyone we will be at the airport between 1:00 and 5:00ish.
16	What do you mean draft picks?
17	I'll give you my first round pick next year, you give me Trent Green.
18	Hey have you eaten lunch yet?
18	And when do I get Stacy Mack?
19	Jay, We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.
19	I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.
19	Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.
19	So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.
19	Paul
20	Wyoming was great and it was good to see YOU at the game.
20	What do you mean about odds?
21	Paul & Stan Here is our purchase proposal we have been sending out for renewal on our purchase agreements.
21	We have left it somewhat open ended to account for differences in the individual gas packages.
21	Please review this proposal, as I will be calling you shortly to discuss any changes or questions you have to the proposal.
21	You can reach me at (303) 575-6474.
21	Sincerely, Paul Lucci
22	Bob, Here are the picks for week 4: Joey Brewer - Miami Paul "going all the way" Lucci - New York (Giants) Paul

25	Sincerely, Paul Lucci
26	Hello you guys, Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!
26	You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.
26	Anyway I hope you're doing fine.
26	I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.
26	I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.
26	I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.
26	The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.
26	The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.
26	There are people flying in from all over the country.
26	Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.
26	It's a big pain but obliviously needed.
26	I'll talk to you guys soon.
26	Go UT!
26	Paul PS We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!
27	What weekend?
27	I will be in San Antonio, TX from 10/12-10/15.
27	So if it's this weekend I'll be out of town.
27	But, if not let's party!
28	Here is the updated version.
29	I think that chick gave me something!
29	I serious.
30	Updated Hot List;
31	I totally agree, I was extremely stupid.
31	I'm not kidding, I already have a funny sensation just like I used to get when I was back in OKC.
31	What was I thinking?
32	My mom is having a party.
32	She has this party every year, the average age of the party goers is about 60.
32	At least I can get drunk on my mom nickel.
33	And you know at that age those girls put out.
33	Unfortunately it's their hip that puts out, or should I say "gives out."
34	I'm sure you guys know about Clay Basin.
34	Anyway Kitchen just called and said we have 30 days to get all the gas out of the interruptible storage account about 36,000.
34	So get your F@%&*+ing gas out of the ground.
34	Paul
35	That's funny I saw that original picture and was wondering what the hell was ging on.
35	We thought it was BS.
35	Now I know.
35	What have you been up to?
36	We buy San Juan.
36	But we do not have any gathering.
37	My pick for this week is the Vikings.
37	When are you setting me up with your hair dresser?
38	Bill, Look this diagram over it may be a little confusing so if you have any questions give me a call.
38	Paul
39	When I first saw the picture I did think it had a chance of being real, until everyone else said it was a knock off.
39	I was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera.
39	So at least I had my doubts.
39	So you want to stay in Calgary another year?
40	Hello, I'm back in the office today.
40	Well I see you have to eat crow!
40	I didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and CU looked good.
40	I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in Austin this weekend.
40	As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion, do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points.
40	I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.
40	And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.
40	I just got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.
40	Yes, I am bribing you!
40	Paul
41	The deal was done with Field Services and we should change our deal ticket "counter party" to reflect that.
41	Thanks Paul
42	Paul, I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as Glen Rock is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.
42	We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.
42	Anything after that is anyone's guess.
42	If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.
42	Hope all is well, and watch out for CU!
42	Paul
43	Bob, What about me picking two winning teams last weekend.
43	Can you send me the latest updated version of the pool.
43	Also what about lunch later this week so I can get you your money.
43	Tell Larry we are going to party Friday, so he better go along.
43	Paul
44	I will call her.
44	I need to give my hair about two weeks to grow out.
44	Has she started to date again.
44	I thought she had given up on men after her divorce?
44	When are you going to get your hair cut?
44	I've got a date with Karen this week, well at least I think I do.
44	Have you talked to Larry about Friday?
45	Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing.
45	It's that simple.
45	Anyway as for dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if that's too late we can meet earlier.
45	The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big thing for you.
45	Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open.
45	I'll eat anything except for Thai.
45	The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.
45	The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.
45	Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.
45	But I'm sure you already know this about my personality.
45	I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side.
45	I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar, if you believe that to be the case.
45	All those other delivery points need processing arrangements.
45	Don't tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!
46	That's funny!
47	Yes I'm still alive.
47	And if you want let's think about lunch next week.
47	I just got back in town last night and I'll be busy all week.
47	If lunch dosen't work out next week, we are having a happy hour on the 26th.
47	I don't know where yet but tell everyone.
47	How are things with you?
48	That party on Saturday night sounds fun.
48	I've got plans Friday but nothing on Saturday.
48	Is this the friend that was dating all those guys while she is married?
49	Yeah that party sounds fun, count me in. Where do you live and what night is this IPAMS reception?
50	Please look this deal over throughly as we are getting very close to closing with these guys.
50	I will be giving both of you a call this morning to answer and final questions you may have.
50	Thanks Paul
51	What time should I meet you at your house on Saturday?
51	I'm not going to the reception tonight.
51	Shoot me back directions to your house.
52	Here is what about we have been showing Kennedy Oil.
53	Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.
53	Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.
53	Then weeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).
53	If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.
53	Thanks Paul
54	4:45 isn't that early.
54	What kind of a party will this be?
54	Will there be a lot of people, and what time is it over?
55	Please disregard all previous emails this is the right one ......I hope.
56	please send them again so we can line them up.
57	Ok, I'm in!
57	Should I just show up at your house, at 5:00?
58	I'm looking forward to Saturday, thanks for inviting me!
58	Since you don't want to be the first person at the party you can kill time by giving me a tour of your house.
58	I printed the email that has all the information, so I'll plan on calling you sometime Saturday and then meeting you at your house at 5:00.
58	Let's talk Saturday, here's my home phone number (303) 469-6768, and my cell (303) 810-5708.
58	Should we bring anything?
59	Beer is fine with me.
59	So you have to drive Greg around all day Saturday.
59	That should be a perfect time to talk to him about his wife's fondness with other men.
59	And since Russ is going to the party will there be a fight?
59	This party is going to be exciting!
60	Ruth, Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.
60	It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.
60	I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.
60	Paul
61	Bob, This week I pick the Colts!
61	I'm meeting Karen tonight for dinner, so I'll tell you how that goes.
61	She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that Bob."
61	I said "I thought you and Bob were friends."
61	And she said "Oh that Bob!"
61	So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."
61	Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.
61	We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.
61	Maybe even "Cool River."
61	Paul
62	I'm glad you had a good time.
62	I did also.
62	Yes, keep me posted on your happy hour.
62	I talked to Bob this morning and explained your frustrations and that you have him on your S___ List.
62	So he said he would like to talk to you.
62	So you see, once again I have served you well.
63	P.S.
63	I was kidding about Bob, I want your adrenaline to flow.
63	I thought it would help wake you up.
63	Gotcha!!
64	Gerald, Eric, in structuring, has this question on the wording of the Kennedy Amendment.
64	I told him you "the master of wording" was ok with it.
64	What do you think?
64	Paul PS I hope it closes today!
65	Hey you back!
65	I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.
65	Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy.
65	I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
65	Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.
65	I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.
65	So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.
65	And, yes I wuld like to get together.....
65	Paul And you too have a great day!!!
66	Ruth, This is a revised copy from Gerald.
66	Please disregard the last copy and review this one.
66	I'll call you to make sure you get it.
66	Paul
67	DENIED!!!!!!!!!
68	That's too bad, I would have come down and met you.
68	What has been going on with you?
69	What you had a birthday without telling me about the party!
69	What did you do?
69	What are you guys doing for Halloween?
70	Sorry I have been out of the office on vacation and business.
70	I'll call Basler ASAP.
70	What about you, what's up?
71	Who got spanked?
71	Hopefully Natalie!
71	We are partying on Halloween.
72	So, if I have made payment under this plan will these new CD's I've ordered be free even though they have initially been accessed a charge?
72	Can you just check my account to see how this new order will effect it.
72	Is there any way you can provide me with a phone number to speak to someone?
72	Thanks Paul
73	Hey it's too late for you.
73	There was a Thursday night game and your rules state, and I quote "During weeks of Thursday night games, all picks will need to be in by noon on Thursday."
73	Therefore see you later, and thanks for playing.
73	Sorry, but rules are rules.
73	Happy Hour Friday 10/26.
74	Larry, I'm checking your email so if you get this sind me an email back.
75	We are meeting for drinks after work today, so if yo wnat you can meet us.
75	If not the REAL happy hour is next Thursday so you better be there.
75	What are you doing on the 27th?
76	Call me during the day so we can get it all planned.
76	I'll talk to Tia to make sure everthing is cool.
77	We are thinking of renting a Limo Saturday night, and hitting a few parties what do you think.
78	What about renting a Limo Saturday night Oct 27th for all the Halloween parties.
78	$87.00 all inclusive per hour with liquor.
78	We can seat 10.
79	Hey where's the happy hour?
80	What did this week look like?
80	I'm out but I bet a lot of people are too.
80	Shoot me the updated list please.
80	And what's up for the weekend?
80	I'm starting early!
81	Hey what are you guys doing partying without me.
81	Yes I have been traveling, in fact I have been gone almost all October, up through the 15th.
81	But I'm finished.
81	When are you thinking of getting together?
82	Heidi, Here is my vacation schedule for the remainder of the year.
82	I should have 4 days to carry over once you take all these days into account.
82	Please tell me if this is correct.
82	Vacation: November 1st Thanks Paul
83	You are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.
83	Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you.
83	I like to keep everything short and sweet.
83	So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.
83	You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.
83	Too bad the car is full.
83	And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance.
84	Do you want to go to dinner sometime?
84	Maybe I'll have you up to the house where I can do some REAL cooking!
85	Ok, and yes!
85	Send me a picture of you so I can remember what you look like.
85	I mean what you really look like!
86	You can use it if I can find it.
86	I may have lost it on Saturday night.
86	I was very drunk.
87	I would like to shut it down.
87	So send me my pro rata share.
87	How was your party?
87	And hot chicks?
88	What's up?
89	Steven changed jobs.
89	Email Whitt for his new numbers.
89	Any hot chicks at your party.
89	I was out voted Saturday night in favor of Opie Gone Bad at the Little Bear.
90	We can't open this!
91	That's a Wednesday night?
91	Are clothes involved?
91	And can I take pictures?
92	Where are you?
92	I'm leaving today at 4:30, I've got to get some things done.
93	I have a customer in town Thursday night, so we will be taking him out to dinner, than to the Nuggets game.
93	I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.
93	We will have to do dinner some other time.
93	Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.

97	Are you in today?
98	You can be my personal assistant.
98	What's up with you on Saturday night?
98	Are you feeling any better today?
98	Don't worry it will all work out!
99	I won't be able to go with you Friday night, I wasn't even invited.
99	Keep in touch and we will figure out a time to get together.
100	What is going on?
101	What's up with you?
101	I talked to Mark, we both decided.....NO WAY!!!!!!!!!
101	No just kidding, you better get your best dress ready for you interview!
101	Your interview questions are going to be REAL TOUGH!
101	Paul
102	Updated hot list;
103	Mark is saying that your the top candidate for this position.
103	No matter what I say I can't change his mind.
103	Man I can hardly wait!!!!!!
104	Don't worry he has made up his mind so no matter what I say I can't change it.
104	What are you doing later this week?
104	Now that you have a job you can take me out.
105	I just hung out yesterday and worked around the house and watched football.
106	After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.
106	Instead I watched football and worked around the house.
106	I was able to get a couple things done that have been left undone for awhile, so it was worth it.
106	You are leaving town for a couple of weeks?
106	Where are you going?
106	I'm free every day except Wednesday.
107	I'm free everyday except Wednesday.
107	So it's up to you.
108	Yeah, let's do lunch on Thursday!
108	Who are you going on your vacation with?
109	Yeah when are you free?
109	Let's do something!
110	I just got your message, are you on the computer right now?
111	Too slow to Cyber Chat.
111	Call me at work (303) 575-6474
112	What's Up?!
112	What's OUR plan later this week?
112	What day/time/where?
113	Saturday and Thursday night, what else do you want from me?
113	Where were you thinking of meeting, what theater?
114	Why not Saturday?
115	Oh I can handle it!
115	Can you?
116	Contact me directly, I always want to be involved!
117	Stock symbol ENE, Company that you would be working for is Enron America's or Enron North America.
117	There should be an Enron web site.
117	Enron.com
118	Did you get my voice mail about the logistics of tomorrow night?
119	Yes you are!
119	So does that work, for me to meet you at the restaurant at 6:00?
120	Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.
120	Search Over!
120	Due to the recent drastic fall in the Enron stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.
120	So we will have to look for a place to stay.
120	Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.
120	We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.
120	I'll start looking for leads on housing.
120	I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.
120	Keep me posted on everything.
121	Hey Jack needs to only talk to me.
121	And, what color are you wearing?
121	I would hold on Enron stock for now.
121	I think it is a long term buy but I don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get a better price if you wait.
121	Are you wearing Jeans tonight.
122	Yes I'm going to the luncheon today.
122	I also brought jeans, but I too am wearing a skirt so I won't deprive YOU of a look at MY legs.
123	Hello; How are you today?
123	I talked to Alicia she is going to talk to you then provided everything is cool, which I think it is, she'll buy the tickets and I'll pay Mark.
123	So, I've got you covered.
123	What do you have going on Friday.
123	Want to come over to my house and play?
123	I'll be out the majority of the day but write me back.
123	Paul
124	What is the plan for tomorrow for lunch.
124	Do you want to meet me downtown?
124	I'll be out the majority of the day.
124	Talk to you soon.
124	Paul
125	I'll forward you these emails when I get them.
126	The concert was great!
126	We had box seats so we drank for free, which is always a plus.
126	As far as Enron goes we definitely need this Dynegy deal!
126	What's up with you this weekend?
126	We are going to the wine tasting thing on Saturday, right?
126	What about Friday night want to play doctor?
127	Debra, I haven't been involved in these final rounds of contact changes so please get with Gerald so we can get this contact out the door.
127	Paul
128	Gerald, Can you get with Debra on this contract I don't know why she is still jacking with this.
128	How's everything else going?
128	Oh, I called Darrin on those credit figures that will be needed for that amendment to the Kennedy Oil contract, has he called you?
128	Paul PS Our trip to Vegas isn't looking great right now!
129	I briefed Scott, +8 into WIC & +1 CIG Wind, both at the mid.
129	I'm thinking about the 2000 A8, they start in the low 50's.
129	I think I'll take out a loan and secure it with Enron stock and stock options!
130	This is a test to see if you receive this email.
130	Good luck!
131	Do you want to meet for lunch Wednesday?
131	Then spend the night, or at least until you have to leave?
131	WE can hot tub!
132	I was meaning for you to come down Wednesday night.
132	I have lunch plans already, sorry.
132	Is that ok?
133	Hey, where are you?
133	Did you get my last email?
133	Paul
134	I was wondering where you were.
134	I've got tickets to the Broncos' game on Sunday, would you want to go?
134	Also, I need to get back to working on buying gas delivered off the Jonah system, so can we talk about delivery points and rates?
135	Hey what are you up to today?
135	Are you still planning on meeting me for dinner?
135	Paul
136	Yeah Baby, that hits the spot!
137	I'm looking forward to it also.
137	I may not do the ski training class tonight, I'm worried about my ankle.
137	So, if I don't I'll be ready around 6:30.
137	I'll keep you posted.
137	Let's talk later.
138	When you get a chance call me.
139	Dear Abby says; call her, hunt her down!
139	If you don't want her I'll take her or at least I'll take her after you.
140	The latest at Enron is Business as usual.
140	At least that's what they want us to believe.
140	I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.
140	I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.
140	Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!
140	Nothing new with me.
140	I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!
141	I promise.
141	In fact why don't you and Bob take us to the Rio on Friday so we can drink, I mean forget about our troubles.
142	Plan on 6:30!
142	Studlet
143	I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.
143	I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.
143	As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.
143	I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.
143	I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.
143	PS I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!
144	Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!
144	I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.
144	I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.
144	But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.
144	Thanks Again Paul PS At dinner, see if you can seat me next to Nadine, I'll owe you!
145	Hello yourself.
145	I did fall back asleep, in fact I even overslept.
145	But I feel good today, real good!
146	I'm in!
146	What will Felicia be wearing?
147	Well at least that was all you guys buried!
147	I know you don't like these types of jokes, but I couldn't resist.
148	Did he or didn't he?
148	You decide!
149	It was a little boy sucking his finger standing next to a dog whose tail is straight up and his butt is hanging out.
149	The caption read did he or didn't he.
149	How do you feel today....sore?
149	I hope, I want to be the man, please let me.
150	Really!
151	Ha Ha Ha!
151	I thought that part about the teeth out was interesting.
152	Here's one that's clean!
153	Craig, Can you please get with John Cogan on our need for all wire transfer backup.
153	We will need the detail of all wire transfers sent to ENA for payment on the CIG and PSCo assets.
153	You can reach me at 303 575-6474.
153	Thanks Paul
154	Mara, This is updated.
154	I'll be using this hot list.
154	Thanks Paul
155	I know I whant to find THAT girl!
156	Good morning, I do feel better today.
156	I think being outside yesterday brought out the worst in my cough.
156	Good luck in your talks!
157	Hey, What's up with you?
157	I have been out all day so I just got in. What's new?
158	Who is telling you that they "Love You?"
159	Now wait a minute I think your getting in too deep here.
159	I have always or at least have reserved the right to see other people.
159	So, don't freak out!
159	Or I'll spank you!
159	Paul
160	That's good!
160	Is that at the Broncos' game?
161	Did I upset you?
161	I hope I didn't tell you anything you didn't already know.
162	This is a Gas Daily call deal.
162	The deal is still alive and underway.
162	The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.
162	Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.
162	Thanks Paul
163	As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.
163	Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.
163	They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.
163	I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.
163	I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.
163	They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."
163	Paul PS I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.
164	test
165	yes, completely crippled.
165	he had to leave his car and take a taxi!
166	The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.
166	1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.
166	I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.
167	That was funny!
167	I laughed my ass off.
167	Sorry I didn't call you, I left my cell phone at the office.
167	Have a happy Thanksgiving!
168	Yes I had a good weekend.
168	What about you?
168	Mark talked to Heidi today, so.......
169	Call me later tonight at home.
169	I kinda busy today and I want to get out of here early.
169	I'll talk to Mark about your start date.
169	Are you bored?
170	What are you trying to say?
171	Hello, Thanks for sending me an email.
171	I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.
171	But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.
171	Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?
171	Drop me a line and we can hash this out.
171	Paul
172	Hello, Thanks for the email.
172	I would like to talk more, but since I don't know you I haven't a clue as to what to talk about.
172	I did notice you live in Morrison, do you work there also?
172	I like that area.
172	What about you and this service, have you been using it long, and do you like it?
172	Drop me a line and I'll start firing back questions.
172	Paul
173	I did have a good Thanksgiving, how about you?
173	Thanks I'll put this number on the deal ticket.
173	Paul
174	I just went down to the mail room....
174	I'll call you.
175	Extremely, AND everybody got a flower on Saturday night except me because you weren't there to buy me one!
175	What's up for this week, my hot tub is still crying out for you.
175	Oh by the way I figured out why the water is so harsh on your skin.
175	So, I will need to fix that ASAP.
175	It's giving me a rash, at least I hope that's what is giving me a rash.
175	See ya!
176	ME!
177	I'm very very good.
177	But, acting very very bad!
178	Oh yeah things are changing every minute!
178	We are partying!
178	What about you?
179	Hey call me tonight at home, so we can catch up!
180	Thanks for the email.
180	I have finally picked out a car, it's the BMW 540i.
180	I'm looking for a Black car, 2000 or newer.
180	Thanks for all your help.
180	Paul
181	Yeah, actually we are throwing a happy hour tonight.
181	You should meet us for drinks.
181	I'm going to lunch now, so I'll talk to you later.
182	Now here is fine one!
183	Carole, Wow you are really bringing me down!
183	No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.
183	I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.
183	If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to Denver and I'll take you skiing!
183	Paul Paul Lucci 4761 Yates CT email I need to get it fixed, I've been receiving everything here at work.
184	That's so weird, I'm been running around the office all day today yelling; we're done, we're done.
184	But only for a different reason.
184	Do you want your old job back?
184	Congrat's on school.
184	Come down here and buy us a drink!
185	We ARE working!
185	But we don't know if we are getting paid.
185	We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.
185	But after that who knows?
185	They are laying off over 80% in Houston.
185	We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.
185	What did you do this weekend?
185	Did you go out with your "friend" JP?
186	Hey you.
186	I just came back to my office, the one I'm moving into once all the construction is over.
186	Only the contractor pulled out and all construction has come to a stop!
186	The contractor, Todd, isn't acting all that honestly in this bankruptcy stage.
186	Where and what time do you want to meet tomorrow?
187	Call me on my cell 303 810-5708.
187	I want to know what's up with tonight.
188	What is UP my brother?
188	Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.
188	The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!
188	I don't know why these numbers are coming up.
188	So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.
188	I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.
188	I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.
188	He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!
188	How's everybody doing?
188	OU really hit the skids late in the season.
188	What's up with that?
188	Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.
188	Later for now The Looch
189	Hell No!
189	Ever since last weekend when you made up some bogus excuse about having to celebrate Natalie's birthday and not being able to party with me, I've been sulking!
189	What's up for the weekend.
189	Here's what I have going on; Friday Night-Office Christmas Party, Saturday Night-Hot Tubing with random chicks (any interest?).
190	Check this out it goes on for ever.
191	Well maybe next time I should lay off the free drinks!
191	I've been screwing off all week.
191	I went to the AV's game last night and I'm just getting into the office now.
191	Man I love this job!
191	Paul
192	Great job with Ty!
192	Now what about the rest of us?
193	I received your email but I could not get to your profile.
193	I'm getting an error message when I try and bring it up.
193	I hope you receive this email, if you do see if you can correct the problem on your end.
194	Hi, I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.
194	I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.
194	I hope your flight went well!
194	It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.
194	Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.
194	Paul
195	I have attached my resume.
195	I had to use one of the other guys emails because I was having some problems with my system.
195	Look forward to seeing you on Thursday.
196	Hey, I'm not going to be able to get this in on time.
197	Don't worry I'm not going to do it.
197	Don't I still need to collect from you for the loser's pool.
197	$60.00
198	No need to apologize!
198	I figured you were busy doing something.
198	We did not go skiing yesterday, it seems that even though we are in a period of "No Work" something always comes up and needs to be done immediately.
198	I will be around tonight.
198	I would of tried you later Monday night but I didn't get back to my house until after nine and last night I was at the Nuggets' game watching the San Antonio Spurs, my hometown team, have their way with the Nuggets.
198	I'll call you after 8:00 pm MST.
198	If it works tonight great if not I'll keep trying.
198	You can fill me in on your job.
198	Paul
199	Mark, Theresa asked me to forward this information on to you we will follow up to make sure you received it.
199	Thanks again for everything and I hope all is well with you.
199	Paul
200	Theresa asked me to forward this spreadsheet on to you.
200	Paul
201	I can't believe it!
201	Why?
201	Well good luck in whatever you do.
201	It's always been a pleasure to work with you and I hope our paths cross again in the future.
201	You should look to come skiing now that you have some time off.
201	Take Care Paul
202	Charles figure these questions out!

0	Thank you,
1	Thanks for the update.
1	Mark
2	Thanks for updating me on things.
2	We could get together for lunch some time if you want.
2	I am downtown and generally keep Thursday's open to lunch with friends.
2	I am at 713-853-6544 and you can always leave a message on vm.
2	Take care.
2	Mark
3	Brent, also who has the risk of Y2K under our contracts?
3	If energy is not delivered because of a Y2K problem, is that a force majeure event or otherwise excused?
3	Your are right to raise this issue.
3	Let me know what response you are getting.
3	Take care.
3	Mark
4	Alan, please handle and respond directly to Rick.
4	It looks like it would be a good opportunity for ECT to speak.
4	Mark
5	This is great news!
5	Let's make the most of this opportunity.
5	Thanks, Mark
6	Thanks for the update.
6	Keep spending time getting advice from Barbara.
6	Mark
7	Congrats!
7	Things seem to be building rapidly now on the Continent.
7	Mark
8	Alan, my quick impression is that the checklist format is identifying a number of matters for discussion in a way that will be efficient.
8	What is your impression?
8	Mark
9	Congrats!
9	Mark
10	Thanks for the update.
10	Mark
11	Robert, have you been able to get Alan's comments?
11	Mark
12	Thanks for the memo.
12	Regards, Mark
13	Thanks for the info!
13	Mark
14	Having dealt wih Manfred on a number of matters I have to say I am not surprised.
14	Scott, please get personally involved in selecting a Punder lawyer that will take his place in meetings with customers and regulators.
14	I don't want to lose control of legal to John T in Germany.
14	Let's hire a lawyer on the ground if we need to.
14	Let me know.
14	Thanks.
14	Mark
15	No, but I am ok with it.
15	She is doing a great job.
15	Mark
16	John, thanks for the feedback on Mark and Scott.
16	Regards, Mark
17	1.
17	Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for ECT.
17	I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.
17	This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks.
17	There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems.
17	2.
17	Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy -- in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.
17	The traders and originators helped design the policy and have "bought in".
17	Training was completed in June.
17	This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.
17	3.
17	Lead power industry to develop a standardized form -- pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.
17	The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form.
17	The result will be a significant saving of legal time and effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk of an unintended default.
17	4.
17	Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses.
17	These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii) acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and the Peoples deals.
17	5.
17	Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.
17	6.
17	Deals are Us -- lots and lots of deals done.
17	Legal built a closer relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the company.
18	Charles, the article looks very good to me.
18	I could not open the exhibits.
18	Mark
19	Jim: Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo: Global Trading -- All lawyers providing legal services for trading activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one group reporting to Mark Haedicke.
19	Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books".
19	To that end, Mark will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company.
19	The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks day to day.
19	It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report will be prepared for Enron.
20	Yes.
20	Also, outside legal usually increases over the last 4 months of the year.
20	Mark
21	Justin, thanks!
21	Mark
22	That is great that John has an interest!
22	Mark
23	Thanks for the memo.
23	I think the transaction makes a lot of sense.
23	Mark
24	Jaime: Thanks for the information!
24	Mark
25	Elizabeth, I would like to present at this conference, subject to knowing more about it.
25	Let's talk about about what we would want to talk about.
25	I am wondering how interesting the topic will be.
25	Mark
26	Let me know how it goes.
26	Mark
27	Thanks for the message.
27	I will be over in a few weeks.
27	I look foward to catching up on things.
27	Mark
28	Congrats!
28	It is a good ground breaking deal.
28	Mark
29	Stephen: I would be happy to talk about that.
29	Give me a call at 713-853-6544.
29	Mark
30	Thanks for the heads up.
30	Keep me posted.
30	Mark
31	Mary: Never heard of Barrett.
31	I think it is a good trend that energy companies are seeing it in their interest to join ISDA!
31	Mark
32	Yes, I am planning on attending.
32	I need directions.
32	Thanks.
32	Mark
33	Rob, pass on if appropriate.
33	Mark
34	Jeff, where we at on the project to improve the contracts with the most exposure.
34	Mark
35	I would stay out of it in light of John's message.
35	MARK
36	Thanks for the memo.
36	Mark
37	I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about joining ISDA.
37	He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.
37	He is familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.
37	I told him he would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive Committee.
37	I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.
37	Please give him a call at 011-551-1-2322100.
37	I think he could help build membership in ISDA in Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.
37	He goes by Emilio.
37	I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.
37	Let me know if you have any questions.
37	Regards, Mark
38	Peter, let's set aside at least one-half hour to talk about the approval process and general communication and any issues you want to.
38	Please get it scheduled.
38	Thanks.
38	Mark
39	We will look into it.
39	It may be an infringement.
39	Mark
40	Stacy, please look into this ASAP and report back to me.
40	Mark
41	Yes, go ahead and send it to Kevin.
41	It does not look very helpful in that we cannot argue ENA assigned EES a lot of value.
41	Mark
42	I plan on playing golf.
42	Mark
43	Jim, I am looking for weather data by region for 98 and 99.
43	I believe that there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support that.
43	This is background info to support the arguments for standardized power contracts, which are nearly agreed to.
43	Let me know what there is and who I should talk to.
43	Thanks for your help.
43	Mark
44	Can you look into this and get back to me.
44	Thanks.
44	Mark
45	The schedule looks good.
45	I don't think there is any need for me to meet with Stikeman.
45	Thanks.
45	Mark
46	Should the first order of business be to decide who is responsible for each form and then review who must approve the changes?
46	Maybe we should do that ahead of time?
46	Also, should we set a time schedule?
46	Mark
47	No problem.
48	Terry: Greetings.
48	I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in Japan starting next year.
48	I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?
48	Would you or someone else you know want to talk about that?
48	Let me know.
48	Hope things are going well.
48	Take care.
48	Mark
49	Mary: That is good news.
49	At the rate we are going, we will have enough energy companies before long to have substantial commodity committee meeting in North America.
49	I am still thinking about the breakfast in New York.
49	Take care.
49	Mark
50	Rebecca: This is the response I got back from my contact at IBJ.
50	Let me know if you would like to meet Terry.
50	Mark
51	Terry, thanks for your reply.
51	As our thinking starts to mature, I would like to talk to you about what we see in the Japanese markets re energy.
51	Perhaps, we can talk in New York in November at the ISDA board meeting.
51	Take care.
51	Mark
52	Is your new address working?
53	It was part of ECT, but it was sold.
53	Mark
54	Alan, please confirm that you have told Mike that it is required that Legal be consulted on such a waiver.
54	Mark
55	Great job!
55	The english language will dominate the energy world!
55	Mark
56	These look fine.
56	Have them printed off for me to sign.
56	Mark
57	Fyi.
57	Does this impact on us?
57	Mark
58	See if you can fit her in. Mark
59	Sheila Tweed or Dale Rasmussen.
59	Mark
60	Let's try again in two weeks.
60	Mark
61	Making progress in energy!
61	Mark
62	Martin: Thanks for the update!
62	It looks like great progress in being made.
62	Mark
63	Today, I talked to the GC of both Southern and Duke.
63	Each GC said they were not really up to speed on the issues.
63	I took the opportunity to walk them through the Nerc letter and the action taken at the Serc board meeting.
63	They each attempted to argue our fight was really with TVA.
63	Mark
64	Kristin: Kevin is very concerned with this charge.
64	Why is litigation now being billed up front?
64	Why is there a 50% increase in corporate legal?
64	Why is there a 100% increase in corporate secretary?
64	Why are we billed for the library when we use primarily electronic sources?
64	Could you please work on the answers to these questions and get back to me.
64	Mark
65	I am confirming.
65	Mark
66	Please do not send me these messages as I do not have time to read them.
66	Mark
67	Please do not send me the reports anymore as I do not have time to read them.
67	Mark
68	Please stop sending the newsletter to me.
68	Mark
69	I would like to sit in from 230 to 300.
69	Thanks.
69	Mark
70	This is about a trip to Brazil.
70	She asked me to pay the $6000 in expenses.
70	Do you see any rationale to pay for this?
70	Mark
71	Thanks for the heads up!
71	Mark
72	I would suggest Dan Lyons from ENA Legal for Vision and Values.
72	Mark
73	I think it must be in Moran's area.
73	Mark
74	What do you think of the letter?
74	Mark
75	You would need to start out in the associate program.
75	Good luck.
75	Mark
76	I am only aware of the Edison Institute effort which is a physical power contract.
76	I think he was probably mistaken.
76	Mark
77	My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives business is in North America.
77	We are growing rapidly in derivatives in Europe, but still quite small.
77	In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor on other continents.
77	That is different than major equity, currency or interest rate traders.
77	Mark
78	Paul Trishmann --Check the spelling.
79	You participated in the OGC meeting which was fine.
79	I did not want to miss out on your participation.
79	Going foward, please join the Legal Committee starting this coming Monday and every other week.
79	Mark
80	Neal: Thanks for the message.
80	We are tracking the developments in Washington very carefully.
80	Have Dan give me a call, if he would like.
80	Hope you and your family are doing well.
80	Take care.
80	Mark
81	I will call Mark Golden to respond in a few days.
81	I don't think this is entirely negative for us.
81	We can use it to get the products we want.
81	Mark
82	That sounds like good news to be part of the process.
82	Thanks.
82	Mark
83	Please handle.
83	Mark
84	I look foward to meeting you.
84	I have asked my assistant to get time scheduled.
84	Mark
85	Both letters are fine.
85	Please arrange dates for the Chairman to come to Houston.
85	Thanks for all of your help.
85	Mark
86	Janette, please send him a fax copy only.
86	Mark
87	Thanks for the info.
87	Next year we want to run those fees through legal before they are allocated out.
87	Mark
88	I am looking for someone in Portand to work on power plant development that will mostly be in CA and Nevada.
88	I would like you to talk to Sheila Tweed in my office at 713-853-7093, who is in charge of this effort on the legal side.
88	I will foward your resume to her and of course tell her to keep it very confidential.
89	FYI
90	Greetings: John, I would like to promote Hodge to VP this time around.
90	I know our system has changed to get that done, but I wanted to get your support on this.
90	I believe Jeff has done a good job and added significant value for a long time and has earned it.
90	Give me your thoughts.
90	Mark
91	Wow!
91	Dan please go ahead and make the call and be sure to let them know we are schocked at the amount of the billing!
91	Mark
92	I appreciate the request, but have never given the slides I use out in electronic form.
92	To do that we would need to have very detailed conversations about how they would be used.
92	Give me a call if you still want to talk about it.
92	Mark
93	I will see you there.
94	Don, thanks for the feedback.
94	I am supposed to meet with Mike G tomorrow and I would like to chat with you after that meeting.
94	Hope things are going well.
94	I will give you a call.
94	Mark
95	I would be happy to meet with her, but is unlikely we would be able to sponsor a junior lawyer.
95	It does not work well in our business.
95	Let me know if you want me to talk to her.
95	Mark
96	Yes, I would like to go.
96	Let me know the time.
96	Mark
97	Can you cover this?
98	Thanks Justin.
99	Ok to talk to him, I just don't want to get his expectations up.
99	Mark
100	Thanks.
101	Gay: It is nice to hear from you.
101	I hope things are going well.
101	Merry Christmas!
101	Mark
102	Let's talk about it, but some sort of a consulting role seems appropriate.
102	I guess it would be less hands on than usual.
102	Mark
103	Alison: I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.
103	This is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!
103	I will copy Paul and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members.
103	Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.
103	Mark
104	1.
104	Enron Online Trading -- organized a legal team and solved enforceability and documentation issues around the world in a few short months for all the commodities traded by Enron.
104	2.
104	Developing New Businesses -- major contributions in developing and structuring coal, insurance, band-width and power plant transactions.
104	The groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of these areas.
104	3.
104	Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff -- pursued Carolina Power & Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft.
104	James and many others.
104	Most have already settled with excellent results.
104	Successfully defended Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen.
104	4.
104	Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement -- ENA lead the Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing the first master power agreement.
104	ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower transaction costs and greater liquidity.
104	5.
104	Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings -- brought overall legal costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 1998, despite the upsurge in origination activity.
104	6.
104	Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals -- as the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex, brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with great success.
104	7.
104	New Concept to Better Manage and Communicate Legal Risks -- developed the legal risk book concept to highlight where the largest buckets of legal risks were and where efforts should be focused.
105	Please try to schedule a call with Justin and Paul in London and Alison at ISDA over the next week or so.
105	Mark
106	I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26.
106	With the launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit business.
106	I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and particular issues in the European market.
106	My preference on timing is in the morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th.
106	Please give your thoughts on this.
106	Take care.
106	Mark
107	FYI, we need to talk about a presentation in the London office on Chinese walls.
107	Mark
108	Thanks for the comments.
108	I will make sure Tana gets taken care of.
108	Mark
109	Please put this on my calender.
110	John: I will get on your calender in January when I am over.
110	It is also my understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that Chinese walls are not necessary.
110	But it will be necesary to address if equity trading starts up.
110	Also, there are probably related issues, like restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading.
110	Hope you have time to enjoy the Holidays.
110	Take care.
111	please respond
112	Michael: I think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of ISDAs we have as a way of focusing attention on our progress.
112	I think it may be a good idea to get a paralegal secondee from A&O or Linklaiters.
112	That secondee could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm.
112	Mark
113	I have noticed it!
113	Mark
114	This was the right Monday, so next Monday was the OGC anyway.
114	Mark
115	Let me know if there is anything else I need to do right now.
115	I would think we would want to set up a conference call as soon as we have identified all the panel members.
115	Take care.
115	Mark
116	Please prepare this letter for Cliff's signature.
116	Mark
117	I have listed a few pertinent facts about Jeff for your upcoming meeting.
117	Let me know if you need more information.
117	1.
117	Jeff joined ENA Legal on September 1, 1993.
117	His title is currently Assistant General Counsel.
117	2.
117	Jeff leads a group in the legal department that focuses on physical trading.
117	Jeff spends most of his time on structured deals like Brooklyn Union and physical gas trading.
117	He also has lead the legal team on acquisition deals such as Columbia Energy Services.
117	He has a strong work ethic and an excellent record in closing important transactions.
117	3.
117	He has good legal judgment and is described by his clients as a knowledgeable and practical trading lawyer.
117	4.
117	Jeff has consistently ranked "excellent" in the performance review process.
118	John, I can make it on this coming Tuesday.
118	Mark
119	Anita: Thanks for your note.
119	You made a great contribution to the Singapore office and I thank you for that.
119	Have a happy new year!
119	Mark Haedicke
120	Gareth: Thanks for that note.
120	Have a happy new year!
120	Mark Haedicke
121	Ernest: Happy New Year!
121	Is it too late to call on behalf of your wife?
121	I was swamped in December and never got to it.
121	Let me know.
121	Take care.
121	Mark
122	Ken: This looks fine to me.
122	Where do we go from here?
122	Mark
123	FYI
124	The name does not sound familiar to me.
124	Mark
125	Please give me an update so we can get this done.
125	Mark
126	Happy New Year!
126	Thanks for the message.
126	I will check on this asap.
126	Mark
127	By copy of this message, I ask Janette to help Mark out with his request.
127	Please have Mark stop by.
127	Mark
128	FYI
129	I hope it comes true!
129	Mark
130	Calpine was going to take assignment of a contract with LCRA and backed out on the agreement.
130	We can talk about it more when I am in Portland on Tuesday and Wednesday.
130	Take care.
130	Mark
131	I will bring some to London as you requested.
131	See you soon.
131	Regards, Mark
132	FYI
133	Bob: I am fine with your proposed endorsement language.
133	It was great to see you last week!
133	Mark
134	OK
135	I am working on a plan to increase our bench strength in trading.
135	Wtih bandwidth, EOL etc., I think recruiting additional lawyers to do trading legal work is critical.
135	I will give you and Michael a call over the next week or so.
135	Take care.
135	Mark
136	My e-mail address is changed to mark.e.haedicke.enron.com
137	Julie, great to have you back!
137	Mark
138	Mary, by copy of this e-mail, I am asking Justin how big a presence National Power is in energy trading.
138	It seems to me National Power is more analogous to a dealer than a subscriber.
138	Mark
139	How big a presence is National Power in the market?
139	Are they analogous to a dealer?
139	Mark
140	Welcome!
140	Please stop by.
140	Mark
141	Let's talk about it.
141	Mark
142	I will be in Tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in Japan for Enron.
142	I would like to book time on your respective schedules to meet on Wednesday afternoon.
142	I have some flexibility in my schedule if that does not work for you.
142	I will be in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday too.
142	Look foward to hearing from you.
142	Mark Haedicke
143	Do we want to talk to him again?
143	If yes, Jeff, please give him a call.
143	Mark
144	Sorry, I can't make it.
144	Mark
145	Thanks for your note.
145	I think it is easiest to contact Julia Murray and Lance Schuler.
145	Please call me at any time.
145	Mark
146	Mary: I think National Power should be more than a subscriber member.
146	Mark
147	Dear Terry: Thanks for your quick reply.
147	Wednesday at 2 PM works for me.
147	I would be happy to come to IBJ's offices.
147	I will be joined by two others on our team.
147	I would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in Japan.
147	Let me know if this is OK with you.
147	Look foward to seeing you.
147	Regards, Mark
148	Richard: Looks good with one change: please delete the reference to honesty -- it's a little too tough.
148	Mark
149	Martin: Thanks for the update.
149	It sounds overall like the direction will not be negative to our business in any material way.
149	Is that correct?
149	How is the weather?
149	Mark
150	Alan, have you looked at these opinions for Japan, Korea or Singapore?
150	Are they helpful?
150	Let me know.
150	Mark
151	Bill: Let's try to get together today or tomorrow.
151	I will be out next week.
151	Also, give Lance a call and get on his schedule.
151	Look foward to seeing you.
151	Mark
152	It is my understanding that it is ok with Jim and Elizabeth if Janette attends and works at the conference.
152	If that is correct, I am ok with her attending.
152	Mark
153	Terry: We are meeting our accounting firm for lunch so we are not available.
153	Thanks anyway.
153	The address I have for IBJ is 1-3-3 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku.
153	Is that the correct address of your office?
153	Let me know.
153	Regards, Mark
154	Travis, could you please spend a few minutes on this and respond to Steve Wallace?
154	Thanks.
154	Mark
155	Joe: I think there are several positive things to point out.
155	ISDA is opening an office in Japan as of April 13.
155	They have already hired one person and are looking for addtional people.
155	More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing up the resources in Japan.
155	IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market place.
155	That's all I can think of for now.
155	Take care, Mark
156	next time!
157	Paul: Thanks so much for your help.
157	I think the legal team you have made available to us is very impressive.
157	I look foward to our success in Japan.
157	I have authored many articles on trading in markets around the world.
157	Would anyone in your shop like to work with me on energy trading and documentation in Japan?
157	Mark
158	Mark: I will be in Amsterdam for the ISDA board meeting on March 15 and 16.
158	I would like to get an update on the APX before leaving for Amsterdam.
158	For example, do we think it will be successful?
158	What kind of volume is trading?
158	Also, I wanted to get your recommendation on what law firms or maybe the APX that I should visit while I am there.
158	Hope things are going well.
158	Regards, Mark Haedicke
159	Bill, thanks for the invitation, but I cannot make it.
159	Take care.
159	Mark
160	I am sorry for ISDA that Mark Harding cannot run for Chairman again.
160	I will give you a call.
160	Is Montag willing to do it?
161	Seth: I thought last week was very productive.
161	I appreciated your help.
161	The ISDA office in Tokyo is set to open officially on April 13, 2000.
161	Yasuko Horibe, who is currently in the ISDA office in NYC at 212-332-1271 is planning on moving to Japan to open the office.
161	Give her a call and get more details.
161	Get back to me if you don't get the info you need.
161	Mark
162	Per our conversations.
162	Give me a call.
162	Mark
163	Mark, give me a call.
163	Mark
164	Please provide your comments to me as soon as you can.
164	The most important thing at this point is to make sure I have the business correctly described.
164	I am working on the letter of intent now.
164	We will have to decide how detailed you want the term sheet and loi.
164	I would think you would want it fairly general for your first few meetings until we get feedback.
164	Let me know.
164	Mark
165	There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.
165	The idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business.
165	Specifically, Enron might propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.
165	We would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.
165	What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
165	What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
165	Should legal counsel be in attendance?
165	Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?
166	Jeff, please review and let's talk about it.
166	Mark
167	Thanks, please work with Travis as I asked to take the lead on developing the conference.
167	Mark
168	Thanks for the feedback.
168	Mark
169	I think we need coordination on all plant matters.
169	Mark
170	Talk to Janette and let's get a few other people.
170	Mark
171	Paul: I think we should have a brief meeting of you and me and Lance Schuler to plan out a strategy and then direct Raisler.
171	Let me know if this sounds ok to you.
171	What do you think is driving the change of mind?
171	Regards, Mark
172	Seth: There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of the office.
172	You should find out that person's name and try to meet with that person in Japan as soon as you can.
172	I think Enron should try to steer one of the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way.
172	I am not sure what committtee that would be at this point.
172	I think you should have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the board level.
172	Let's keep comparing notes.
172	Regards, Mark
173	I am ok with all the changes except the deletion of the last sentence in paragraph 1.
173	I don't understand why Abitibi-Consolidated deleted that sentence.
173	Mark
174	Tim: I am preparing a list of the pluses and minuses for the three main alternatives of Settlement, Hearing and FERC.
174	I think it will be helpful to channel the discussion.
174	I will send it to you later today.
174	Mark
175	At this point, I think they should be a subscriber member, since trading of paper is an emerging market.
175	Mark
176	Sorry for my tardy reply.
176	I have been covered up.
176	Thanks anyway.
176	Mark
177	I am not sure.
177	The numbers do look reasonable to me.
177	See if they are ok with Sheila Walton and would fit in with our standard policy.
177	Mark
178	We have not talked about this.
178	Mark
179	What's going on?
179	Where are working now?
179	Mark
180	Please print out for Bob Crane to sign.
180	Mark
181	Great conference in Amsterdam.
181	It was the best one yet.
181	I would like to have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next year.
181	I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a) energy derivatives around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.
181	If we do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our membership dramatically.
181	Let me know what you think.
181	Regards, Mark
182	Yes, I want to continue receiving it.
182	Mark
183	Have you thought about Arthur Andersen or PriceWaterhouse?
183	Mark
184	yes.
185	Please get the lunch on my schedule and book me to take them on a tour of the trading floor.
185	Mark
186	Thanks for the info.
186	Mark
187	Bill: I am looking foward to the game!
187	I will try to walk over to your offices by 6:00.
187	Mark
188	Rick, please send me the schedule so I can foward it on to our lead trader in Japan.
188	Thanks.
188	Mark
189	That sounds like a great start in France.
189	Mark
190	Thanks.
190	We are in litigation with the Px.
190	Let me know if she continues to pursue Enron.
190	Mark
191	Thanks for the info.
191	Mark
192	Best of luck!
192	Please keep in touch!
192	Mark
193	I am on the boards on Harris County Children's Protective Services and International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
193	Mark
194	Liz, I would love to go.
194	Can I let you know tomorrow as I am still not sure what time by obligations here are over?
194	Mark
195	I don't know the person mentioned.
195	Mark
196	I will have to take a rain check.
196	I am meeting my son's fourth grade field trip here in SA and as it turns out we won't head back until about 7 pm.
196	Have a great tme.
196	Mark
197	I think that is as good as we can get under the circumstances.
197	I would take it.
197	Mark
198	H&K has done only a little work for us.
198	Mark
199	For your review -- the latest diagram for the paper website.
199	Michael, I am free to discuss this at your convenience.
199	I am hopeful this structure will be unregulated in Europe as well.
199	Mark
200	Not enough experience.
200	Mark
201	I did it last week!
201	I think it is a great seminar.
201	Mark
202	Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view: 1.
202	our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends 2.
202	credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost to customers 3.
202	customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products 4.
202	customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offerings Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.
202	Mark Haedicke
203	George, I think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at hand.
203	I think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have proposed.
203	I would ask Robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your points and then let's all briefly review it.
203	I want to stay mindful that litigation is possible and we have to chose our words carefully in event of litigation.
203	Mark
204	That is a great success.
204	Mark
205	Bill, I am thinking I could do it May 14 or May 21, if that works for others.
205	I will confirm next week if those dates work.
205	Mark
206	Susan: It is ok to provide the requested information.
206	Mark
207	Thanks for the invitation, but I cannot make it on Friday.
207	Have a great time.
207	Mark
208	Yes, the 21st works for me.
208	I already made the mistake of mentioning the 14th to Susan and she reminded me what day it was.
208	Mark
209	Bill, I am flexible but I like between 7 and 8.
209	Mark
210	Ken, how should I help promote the Senate bill?
210	Does it allow us to do a many to many paper product financial exchange without regulation?
210	What would you change about the Senate bill?
210	Mark
211	Dave, I didn't see Julia's name on the list.
211	I assume it was just oversight.
211	Let me know.
211	Mark
212	FYI
213	Yes, talk to Cynthia or Mark Taylor.
213	Mark
214	Thanks, I think your list has real potential from a patent point of view.
214	Mark
215	Thanks, the talking points are helpful.
215	Mark
216	A couple of other thoughts: 1.
216	Aggressively pursue litigation claims and manage litigation risks.
216	2.
216	Build contracts and legal infrastructure to support new businesses like paper.
216	3.
216	Develop top talent in the firms to assist getting all our deals done.
216	Mark
217	I will be there.
217	Mark
218	I could not open the document.
218	Mark
219	Rob, she could talk to Barbara Gray about a position as a paralegal.
219	Barbara is looking for help on some of the asset work.
219	Mark
220	Not enough experience for our shop.
221	Louise, I can take care of this.
221	Once in a while, I need to get my hands dirty.
221	Mark
222	Jason: I have reviewed the CA and only have one comment.
222	I would like to add a paragragh 10 as follows: "This Agreement shall terminate on the date one year from the date of this Agreement."
222	Enron Net Works LLC will be the party to the agreement.
222	The address is 1400 Smith Street, Houston Texas 77002.
222	Please set up the agreement for signature by Louise Kitchen as Managing Director.
222	My number is 713-853-6544 if you have any questions.
222	Regards, Mark Haedicke
223	Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about energy.
223	I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like financial commodity swaps.
223	Also, I pointed out that innovation has been slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure.
223	I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill.
223	Mark
224	Rick Grove and I spoke with Chairman Rainer on Friday about energy and he did not budge.
224	He appears to be strongly against us.
224	Why do you think that is?
225	Pls.
225	handle.
225	Mark
226	Peter, the summary is very helpful.
226	Perhaps, we should drop the summary into the monthly report?
226	Please talk to Julia about that.
226	I want to make it as efficient as possible.
226	Mark
227	Nora, thanks for the information.
227	As new issues come up, please copy Mark Taylor.
227	Thanks for your help.
227	Mark
228	Liz, it looks fine.
228	I have printed it and will initial for Greg's signature.
228	Let me know if you have any other questions.
228	Once you get the original back, please send to me for my files.
228	Mark
229	Julia has all the handouts.
229	Mark
230	Randy, I will be out of town, but that is ok.
230	MARK
231	Chris, I got your message.
231	I am very happy how you are coming out!
231	I think it is a great opportunity for both you and the company!
231	Please work through the move and comp questions with Julia.
231	Of course I will be available as needed.
231	Mark
232	Peter, is there any real risk that contingencies from LGEC could spill over to Enron Canada?
232	Mark
233	Please set up a meeting next week with Randy and Michelle and Dan to briefly review the issues below.
233	Mark
234	I am in Houston, but would be happy to give him some contact names.
234	What is his background?
234	That will help me come up with the right people.
234	Mark
235	FYI
236	Bob: Sorrry for the delay in responding.
236	I am ok with V&E representing the underwriter with the usual carve-outs..
236	Mark
237	I have not heard of the firm.
237	Mark
238	Thanks for the summary.
238	Mark
239	I am OK with this so long as it does not set a precedent for next year.
239	Mark
240	You're very welcome.
240	Mark
241	Paul, thanks for the risk memo!
241	Mark
242	Peter, thanks for the note.
242	Please copy Julia on updates of this nature.
242	Mark
243	Please put on my calendar.
243	Mark
244	Dear Mr. Esposito: I would recommend you talk to Brian Seyfried in London at 44-207-783-7907 re credit and Jere Overdyke in Houston at 713-853-9171 re insurance derivatives.
244	Let me know if you need any more help.
244	Sincerely, Mark Haedicke
245	Yes, I am generally familiar with the deal.
245	Mark
246	I would like to be on the panel but I have on a conflict on the conference dates.
246	Please keep me in mind for next year.
246	Mark Haedicke
247	Bill, that works for me.
247	I am happy to ride together.
247	Let me know what time you will pick me up.
247	Thanks.
247	Mark
248	I am fine with your proposal.
248	Mark
249	I have put the executed doc in the mail.
249	Mark
250	I will be out of town.
250	Thanks for asking.
250	Mark
251	Greg, it looks fine to me.
251	Let's make sure we have the supporting documentation of the good standing certificate and board resolution.
251	Mark
252	Jeff, here is the list of managers and officers as it now stands.
252	Let me know what additional changes you want made and we will get all of them done.
252	Mark
253	7:45 is ok with me.
253	I am at 14623 River Forest.
253	Let me know if you need directions.
253	Mark
254	We did a cogen deal in Nevada.
254	Try asking Karen Jones in Portland.
254	Mark
255	This is a test.
256	For preparation of my travel folder for the trip.
256	Mark
257	Fish.
258	Please put this on my calendar.
258	Mark
259	Please check with Janette.
259	Thanks.
259	Mark
260	Janet, I am looking to this now.
260	Mark
261	I think we should try this out.
261	I will work on that.
261	Mark
262	I received the binder.
262	Thank you.
262	Mark
263	Dave, I wanted to let you know that I will be in Israel on July 28, on the date of the VP pre-ranking.
263	This is a long scheduled family trip that would be difficult to cancel.
263	I can call in or get all my comments to you and others ahead of time.
263	Mark
264	That is a very interesting question.
264	I think we would eventually want to include derivatives in the cross default trigger because of their significance.
264	However, since we often have the far larger derivative position, it would seem at least now, this would more often work against us.
264	Mark Haedicke
265	Congrats on the deal!
265	Mark
266	FYI
267	Put on my calendar.
267	Mark
268	I do not know of any reason.
268	Mark
269	FYI.
269	You call and confirm with Dennis Oakley at Chase.
270	Cliff, please find the legal opinion we previously discussed.
270	Mark
271	Don: I would like to attend with you.
271	I will check with my assistant to make sure I can do it.
271	Take care, Mark
272	Bob: After last year it is a close call, but I want to do it again.
272	I am willing to go for one-half again but am ok with only a quarter of the games.
272	Let me know when you need the money and I will scout around to see if anyone wants a quarter of the games.
272	Mark
273	Janet, I received your message and heard you loud and clear.
273	We need to diversify the talent working on your deals.
273	Let's get you together with Julia next week to discuss.
274	Mark, what has been mandated by AA and what is your recommendation.
274	Mark
275	Please put this on my schedule.
275	Mark
276	Chris: Thanks for the feedback on Dale.
276	I agree with your assessment.
276	Take care.
276	Mark
277	Is our filing date of July 1 still on track?
277	Mark
278	I think attending the ISDA workshop would be a good idea.
278	Mark
279	Please find the docs she is referring to so I can sign them.
279	We should get Jeff Hodge to sign them.
279	Mark
280	Alan, FYI.
280	Please forward on to Tom.
280	I could not get his e-mail address to come up.
280	Mark
281	FYI.
281	We should talk about attendance at these meetings re electronic trading.
282	I will not be back from my vacation until August 2.
282	Is it possible to delay your vacation for two days.
282	If not, I think it will be ok.
282	Mark
283	Edmund, thanks for that A&O summary.
283	Is anyone recommending any change in the ISDA agreement or schedules?
283	Hopefully this fact scenario would never apply to Enron.
283	Mark
284	I can go only if there is no Net Works meeting.
284	Mark
285	Alan, there is a good article on power trading in Japan.
285	Please pass it on as appropriate.
285	Mark
286	test
287	Scott, thanks for the note.
287	Mark
288	I would try Rick Shapiro.
288	Mark
289	Rick: As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation on electronic signatures.
289	There is a big need to standardize the approach with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.
289	I think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly make money through a protocol.
289	Let me know what you think.
289	Mark
290	Bob: I think the RFP looks great.
290	The one question I had was whether or not we wanted to put in the RFP our objective in terms of income from the facility.
290	Also, should we encourage joint bids?
290	Take care.
290	Mark
291	Peter: At this point, it seems to me, it may be helpful, but not materially helpful to bid through a separate entity.
291	Do you disagree with this conclusion?
291	Mark
292	Lance, it looks fine to me with exception of the reference to Kinneman.
292	Please revise and send out.
292	Mark
293	Please look at this and give me your comments.
293	Mark
294	Pete, thanks for the memo.
294	Mark
295	George: We have a new lawyer in Alan's group starting in a few weeks.
295	I want this lawyer to help Wayne.
295	I think this will take care of the issue.
295	Thanks.
295	Mark
296	FYI
297	Thanks for asking, but my schedule does not permit speaking at that time.
297	Mark
298	Tim: What's your reaction to this article on Cal Px?
298	Mark
299	Bob: We are working on a "protocol" re electronic signatures.
299	Is this something isda would want to be involved in?
299	Maybe money could be made.
299	Let me know.
299	Mark
300	Alan, I forwarded it on to the GC at ISDA and am looking forward to his comments.
300	Great job.
300	Mark
301	Bob: I think we say we want the facility to be revenue enhancing and that we are in favor of joint bids.
301	Take care.
301	Mark
302	Yes I do think so.
302	He may want to coordinate with V&E, but that is ok.
302	Please point out we are working with ISDA.
302	Mark
303	Let's try to use V&E on the e-signature things as much as possible.
304	Bob: We are working on an e-signature "protocol" and wondered if ISDA wanted to take the lead in this matter?
304	Let me know.
304	Mark
305	Bob: This is something we are working on at Enron.
305	Is this something ISDA has interest in taking a lead on?
305	I think ISDA could add value by developing a standard approach to e-signatures.
305	Mark
306	Let's do it in August during the week of the seventh.
306	Please start working on a short memo for Dave and me to send out.
306	I think we need to have at least two dates.
306	The memo should say attendance is mandatory.
306	Mark
307	I think we should get either you or Sara involved in this.
307	Gary has requested a Houston lawyer help in establishing the business in London.
307	Mark
308	Tim, thanks for the note.
308	Mark
309	This looks ok to me.
309	Mark
310	Thanks!
311	FYI on the lawyers conference.
311	Mark
312	Bill, I called Shapiro about this and he said they were interested and would cover the meeting you told me about.
312	I would give Rick a call at this point.
312	Thanks.
312	Mark
313	Paul: Great news!
313	Were there any difficult questions raised by the SFA?
313	Mark
314	Justin: Thanks for the info.
314	Alan and I are going to work on it from this side.
314	It sure looks like we could use a lawyer in New York.
314	After you and Alan talk it through, let's agree on a plan to get the work done in NYC to make sure we are coordinated.
314	Mark
315	Chris: Thanks for the update.
315	Let's try to get together in Toronto on Tuesday, August 15 or 22.
315	Do either of those days work for you?
315	I would envision getting up to speed on business opportunities in Ontario and addressing the questions you raised.
315	Your proposal makes sense, but I would like to defer our decision until we have had a chance to talk it through.
315	Mark
316	Yes, Michael raised it to me, so that is all clear.
316	With respect to the candidate you mentioned, I think I would need to review his resume and see what the arguments would be.
316	Let's get together and talk about this before you go to the recruiters.
316	Mark
317	Rosemary: Yes, I would be happy to.
317	I would like to get some time on the schedule to review the plan for energy both in North America and Europe.
317	It seems to me that we ought to have a meeting in Frankfurt in Sept and a seminar on energy in Houston over the next six months.
317	Mark
318	Please add this to my schedule.
318	Maybe, I can fly to Toronto the next day.
318	Ask Chris Gaffney if September 21 works for him instead of the dates I proposed in August.
318	Mark
319	Chris: How about Sept 21?
319	I have to be in NYC anyway on Sept 20.
319	Mark
320	Please review the attached summary of legal risks.
320	Mark
321	In preparation for our meeting on Monday, I listed the key legal issues re the PPAs.
321	Mark
322	I think you need to do their reviews.
322	I would coordinate with Jeff Hodge to make sure you get the appropriate feedback from Houston.
323	Liz: Put me down for $50.
323	Mark
324	Alan, are we doing anything on Aer*x anymore?
324	Please let Mark Holsworth know.
324	Mark
325	I updated mine last week.
325	Please confirm it is not there as of today.
325	Mark
326	What topics do you think would be appropriate?
326	I will have just a few minutes.
326	I was thinking CFTC, electronic trading, physical trading forms and continued opening of power markets in North America to trading.
326	Mark
327	We should include ISDA energy definitions, CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America.
327	I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form.
327	I am thinking 4 slides at the most.
327	Is that what you want?
327	Mark
328	Michael: The September ISDA meeting is coming up and I am starting to plan my schedule.
328	I will be in London on Monday and Tuesday, Sept 12 and 13.
328	I will also be in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday.
328	Are you free for dinner on either Monday or Tuesday?
328	Who is the best person in Frankfurt to give me an overview of the trading markets in Germany?
328	Regards, Mark
329	Jane: There are lots of countries that at first did not allow derivatives and later changed the laws to allow them.
329	Bob Pickel, the GC of ISDA in NYC could give you info on this or Jeff Golden at Allen & Overy in London could give you info.
329	Mark
330	Yes, please check on that.
330	Mark
331	Martin: Looks like great progress!
331	Mark
332	Thanks for the memo.
332	It is going to be a very interesting area!
332	Mark
333	Please set a telephone meeting with Alex for me.
333	Mark
334	Please see note on Frankfurt.
334	Mark
335	Shouldn't we go with LeBeouf?
335	Mark
336	Mark: A concern has been raised about IT service providers working on EOL or other Enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor, such as Dynegy.
336	Since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies, it seems like this is a significant issue.
336	How do we address this risk in the contracts?
336	Do we need to add a non-competition clause?
336	Mark Haedicke
337	Ron: Thanks for your help.
337	Let's get together for lunch some time.
337	Let me know what works for you.
337	Mark
338	NIck: Do we have an erergy meeting scheduled in September.
338	Let's talk about this.
338	We could do it in either London or Frankfurt doing the week of the board meeting.
338	Let me know your thoughts on this.
338	Mark
339	Rick: Thanks for the message.
339	I have sent an e-mail to Nick.
339	I will coordinate with him.
339	Mark
340	Paul: Thanks for the e-mail.
340	I agree with your assessment.
340	I also want to thank you for your support of the legal department.
340	We feel like we are part of the team and I appreciate your efforts in that regard.
340	Take care, Mark
341	Nick: I will plan on being there and will be happy to comment on item 4.
341	I think we also could talk about regulatory barriers to energy trading in Europe.
341	Please keep me posted on seminar plans in Europe re energy.
341	Regards, Mark
342	Bob: per our conversation.
342	Mark
343	It seems to me that our standard language should prohibit service providers from working on any similar project for a competitor or disclosing in any way that work was done for Enron.
343	Also, we may want to specify liquidated damages for violation of this covenant.
343	Any objections to this?
343	Mark Haedicke
344	Jay: You and I can talk through the issues.
344	The key point is that you have to vote the best interest of the corporation on whose board you sit and not your personal interest or the interest of Enron.
344	Give me a call and we can talk through the business of Convergent and what the risks are.
344	Mark
345	I agree.
345	Also, I think what we do here will be cited by others.
345	Mark
346	Mark: Would you please propose language to me along the lines I suggested.
346	Thanks.
346	Mark
347	Please take this comment into account when you draft up some language.
347	Thanks, Mark
348	Dad: Thanks for letting me know.
348	She seemed to be a wonderful person.
348	Things are going well for me and my family.
348	We bought a place at Silver Shells in Destin recently.
348	I am hopeful we will get there some during the summers.
348	Thanks, Mark
349	I will be here next week.
349	Mark
350	Please schedule 30 minutes with Janette.
350	Mark
351	Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong opposition of the CFTC?
351	What kind of odds do you put on it?
351	It is a significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little hard for me to believe that it is real.
351	Should I try to make a trip to Washington in September?
351	Let me know.
351	Mark Haedicke
352	Mark: Let's start using this right away.
352	Mark Haedicke Non-competition: Contractor covenants that it will not use for any reason the By accepting work under this Agreement, Contractor warrants that it will not perform any similar work for a competitor of Company.
352	Contractor acknowledges its obligations under section 4 of this Agreement and, as such, shall not accept any work in which it might divulge any information, ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques learned or created during (collectively the "Information") while providing the work services performed for theCompany, including without limitation, when Contractor provides services to any company competing with the Company.
352	Anytime Contractor provides substantially similar services to a company competing with the Company, it shall take all appropriate caution to protect the Information, use employees that did not provide services to the Company and Contractor shall provide written notice to the Company.
353	Let's talk about this when you get a chance.
353	Mark
354	Please briefly fill-in the attached draft monthly report for Net Works by August 15.
354	Please e-mail your additions to Janette for her to compile.
354	Thanks, Mark
355	I was happy to do it.
355	I really like your artwork.
355	Let's get together for lunch sometime.
355	Regards, Mark
356	Mary: I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.
356	It seems to me that we should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to join ISDA.
356	Let me know if I can help.
356	Regards, Mark
357	Mary: Here is the list on telecom companies.
357	Let me know how I can help.
357	Regards, Mark
358	Great resume, but too specialized for my group.
358	Mark
359	Mark, I was looking for your comments on this memo.
359	Thanks.
359	Mark H
360	I cannot be there, but am very glad you are having this meeting.
360	Mark
361	No I have not.
361	Mark
362	Mary: Spring break for most schools in Houston for 2001 is March 12 through March 17.
362	Otherwise, I am open in Feb and Mar at this time.
362	I think London is a better venue for an energy conference than Amsterdam.
362	Also, I think we will eventually want to do an energy trading presentation on Japan -- maybe at the update on October 26.
362	Mark
363	I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.
363	I propose the following: 1.
363	Retention Period -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 months 2.
363	Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only the deal terms at the end of a call The first change could be made immediately and the second change would require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal terms.
363	Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.
363	Mark Haedicke
364	Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program: 1.
364	Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.
364	2.
364	Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.
364	3.
364	Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.
364	It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary.
364	Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules.
364	There is a similar program being prepared in London.
364	A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.
364	Mark Haedicke
365	Please prepare drafts of the slides suggested in the attached "agenda slide".
365	Mark
366	Paul: I have proposed we change our procedure here and we are discussing the proposed changes.
366	I will send you a copy of my proposal.
366	We can talk about in a few weeks in London.
366	Regards, Mark
367	I am trying to build consensus on this issue.
367	Take care.
367	Mark
368	I think partnering with a lawfirm would be a good idea re documentation.
368	However, I am not sure the ISDA board is likely to pick a proposal that includes a competitor of the stature of Enron.
368	I will call ISDA and try to get a read on what ISDA wants to do which is not clear at this point.
368	Regards, Mark
369	Thanks for confirming the destruction of tapes.
369	Mark
370	FYI
371	I vote for the monastery.
371	I look forward to our meeting.
371	Mark
372	Jenette: please put this tentatively on my schedule.
372	Mark
373	Please set up this meeting.
373	Mark
374	Try Sheila Tweed.
374	We did a few transactions there last year.
374	Mark
375	Larry: On the resume, only one comment.
375	I would split out Community Affiliations or just delete it.
375	I will give the resume to a friend of my in HR and ask where he thinks the best fit would be in Enron.
375	Do you want me to e-mail your resume to a few people I know in other businesses?
375	If yes, please send again without the note to me.
375	Mark
376	I have talked to my friend and the areas where we need help are in coal product and paper product marketing and industrial customer outsourcing.
376	Give me a call and I can describe the opportunities and see what your interest level is.
376	Mark
377	Bob: I think Enron is more likely to use the intranet service.
377	I was unclear however, if additional service was available in the internet service, such as links to the explanatory books?
377	I think generally we would want the convenience of having the ISDA materials inside for use by any Enron employee.
377	If the cost gets too high, I don't think members will pay for it.
377	$10,000 sounds ok to me.
377	Regards, Mark
378	Peter: Thanks for the message.
378	I look forward to getting together.
378	Mark
379	David: Per our conversation last week, I have attached a copy of Mr. Lipman's resume.
379	He has expressed interest in learning more about the coal, paper and steel business opportunities.
379	He will give you a call at 713-853-3557 to schedule a time to meet.
379	Regards, Mark Haedicke
380	Thanks for the e-mail.
380	I have asked Alan to find a time where we could talk on Thursday to make sure we are coordinated on Rudolf Wolffe.
380	Regards, Mark
381	Please circulate as appropriate in Portland.
381	Mark
382	FYI
383	Congratulations to you and your team!
383	Mark
384	Thanks for the invitation but we are going on to Calgary.
384	Mark
385	FYI
386	Bob: Thanks for the heads up.
386	Mark
387	John, I would like to get together for lunch on the 6th of Sept. Take care.
387	Mark
388	Joan: I will talk to Susan and see what her interest is.
388	Thanks.
388	Mark
389	Dan, are you ok with the minutes?
389	Mark
390	Paul: We do Sales Practices training which gets into some of what your are suggesting.
390	I think it is a good idea to take it further with a list of "don'ts".
390	We can get you are training materials.
390	We are in the process of uploading all training materials including videos into various websites.
390	Mark
391	Any interest?
391	If yes, please contact this candidate.
391	Mark
392	Please give me the contact names because I don't know much about this.
392	Mark
393	I am ok with a memo as you proposed.
393	Mark
394	Susan: Thanks for the note.
394	Glad to hear that you are doing well.
394	Please send me a brief description of what ICor does.
394	Regards, Mark
395	Rob, I want to keep a relatively low profile until we settle Project Stanley.
395	With respect to cooperating with TransAlta while the lawsuit is pending -- that seems to send the wrong signal to TransAlta.
395	Mark
396	Wes, I am forwarding the monthly report on Legal.
396	It seems to be inconsistent with the legal budget numbers in the QBRs.
396	Overall, it shows Legal is slightly over budget for the year.
396	Could you have someone compare the numbers and let me know if the monthly report is correct.
396	Mark
397	Please update as you fill in the rest of the dates.
397	Thanks.
397	Mark
398	Joan: Great!
398	Susan said she would like to go to a few shops as you suggested.
398	We can talk about that.
398	Mark
399	That looks good.
399	Our call next week will be on Tuesday and Julia will be leading it.
399	I will see you in London soon.
399	Mark
400	I am ok with it.
400	Mark
401	I agree.
401	I want to change the reporting to be directly to me anyway.
401	Let's discuss.
401	Mark
402	John, I think I can meet for lunch on the 7
403	Thanks for the invitation, but I will be returning from Europe.
403	Mark
404	Thanks for the message!
404	It was a complete victory!
404	Mark
405	For your use if the materials don't make it here in time.
405	Mark
406	Yes, I am happy to do that.
406	Mark
407	We sent a letter asking him to stay away from the families and INS is supposed to show up today and deport him.
407	We'll see what happens.
407	Mark
408	Please hold for me.
408	I will see you soon.
408	Mark
409	Let's plan on talking about BT's hedge claim.
409	Mark
410	Peter: Please give me a two or three sentence summary of the trading issue and court decision thereon in Blue Range.
410	I want to report on it over the next two weeks in ISDA energy committee meetings.
410	Regards, Mark
411	Peter: You are asking good questions.
411	Generally, most employees are part of ENA and provide services to all the wholesale businesses.
411	The executives tend to have their own company business cards and stationary.
411	But, most of the business continues under ENA or an existing company.
411	Occasionally, litigation concerns dictate not following the general rules.
411	You can get more specific info from Julia.
411	Mark
412	Niki: I would be happy for 2 students to be assigned to Legal.
412	Mark
413	large
414	A few of my pictures.
414	Mark
415	Please print these out for me and forward to Mark Taylor, Alan, Elizabeth and Jeff Hodge.
416	Accord should be a primary member.
416	It is the trading arm of British Gas.
416	Mark
417	Thanks for the summary.
417	I had missed your prior e-mail on the topic.
417	Mark
418	Great!
418	Let me know how it goes.
418	Mark
419	Dan, let's go with the following as modified.
419	Thanks, Mark
420	I appreciate all the work you did for us!
420	Mark
421	Well done!
421	Please send a copy of the plan to the OGC and work with Janette to schedule a meeting of the OGC to review the plan and get buy-in across the group.
421	Let's schedule the meeting for 1and 1/2 hours.
421	I would like you in the mean time to focus on a time line to implement the program.
421	Also, please set up a meeting for you and me with Phillippe Bibi to discuss getting help from IT to implement our plan.
421	Mark
422	I don't know anything about this.
422	Mark
423	Put me on the 11:50 flight and let's see if we can do dinner at 7:00 rather 8:00.
423	Thanks, Mark
424	We are looking at buying several paper companies.
424	I think you should send them to me.
424	Thanks.
424	Mark
425	Thanks for the resume.
425	I do not need a regulatory lawyer at this time.
425	Mark
426	John, I don't see that as a problem.
426	It was good to see you.
426	Regards, Mark
427	Send the docs to Julia.
427	Mark
428	Please see below from ISDA.
428	Do we ever want to go to using the ISDA for physical and financial deals?
428	Should this be a long range plan?
428	Mark
429	I have responded below.
429	Also, my title is Managing Director and General Counsel of Enron Wholesale Markets.
429	I would add a bullet " comparison of masters in use in North America."
429	Mark
430	Please fix this for me.
430	Mark
431	Thanks for the message.
431	I will try to get that fixed.
431	Mark
432	Yes, include me on the list.
432	Mark Haedicke
433	What is the status of setting up Chinese Walls?
433	Mark
434	Bill: I would talk to Lisa Mellencamp about representing ENA re East Coast Power.
434	Mark
435	FYI
436	Mary: Sorry, I can't make the lunch.
436	Historically, the interest in Enron sponsoring any event has been very low.
436	I will raise it but I am not optimistic.
436	Mark
437	Looks good to me.
437	Mark
438	Rappaport's comments are potentially very negative to us.
438	I think we should write him a letter in protest.
438	Mark
439	Please handle re Paul Nelson.
440	Please schedule.
441	I am working on the scheduling the meeting this afternoon with Power Systems and their outside lawyers to ask for the legal opinion we need on this matter.
441	We have to nail down all the facts and then get Power System's outside lawyers to write the appropriate opinion.
441	I will keep you posted.
441	Mark
442	Please send an e-mail copy of the speech I gave shortly after meeting with Mr. Ford.
442	Mark
443	George: I will send it by e-mail.
443	Take care.
443	Mark
444	Please call John Arnold and ask him where the traders are coming out on this.
444	Let me know.
444	Mark
445	I think it is both Rappaport and his target audience.
445	I think Dan needs to hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re electronic trading.
445	Silence by us could be misinterpreted by him.
445	Let me know what you think.
445	Mark
446	Dan, please prepare a list of items you think I should sign off on and then set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team.
446	Mark
447	Steve: It looks like a great program!
447	I am happy to participate.
447	I would like to have a teleconference of the panel within a few weeks so that I can make sure I have time to get my materials together.
447	Regards, Mark
448	For your files.
448	Mark
449	I got the chart in electronic form.
449	Mark
450	Dan, I would like to have a brief meeting with the team to talk through the list -- to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.
450	Let's do it soon with the idea we would have another meeting to wrap things up as appropriate.
450	Mark
451	Let me know if you see any problem.
451	Mark
452	Steve: It's ok to put confirmed.
452	Mark cc: Subject: RE: Energy Bar Association Program Mark, I appreciate your taking the time out of your busy schedule to participate in the program.
452	I will plan to arrange a conference call during the early parof October among the e-commerce panelists.
452	Can the program reflect that yoare confirmed, or should we list you as invited?
452	Steve
453	Please briefly review the slides attached below and give me your reaction.
453	Please forward on to our clients if you think it would be helpful.
453	Mark
454	I think you must be looking for Mark Holsworth at Enron Corp. Mark Haedicke
455	Paul: It is true that there is no wall -- however, it is geographically separate.
455	The equity trading is the end portion of the floor.
455	There are three hallways that go to equity trading, each about 10 feet long.
455	It would not be possible to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area.
455	Robert Bruce is working on updating our policy and procedures in Houston and by copy hereof ask him to update you.
456	Please confirm we send this memo to MDs and key commercial employes.
456	Mark
457	Everyone was intrigued that Enron submitted a proposal.
457	However, it is difficult to guess the outcome.
457	Mark
458	Rick: I would like to have a presentation on local rules such as ISO rules in the various locations where we operate.
458	Can your group do this as we work on the legal presentations.
458	I believe this is already happening in part, but I would like to make more institutionalized.
458	Let me know.
458	Mark
459	Please work with Richard Sanders to decide on the distribution list which should include all MDs and Robert Knight.
459	I want to get it out by Wednesday.
459	Mark
460	per our conversation.
460	Mark
461	Per our conversation.
461	Mark
462	There is no attachment.
462	Mark
463	Please retype and send the memo directly within e-mail.
463	Thanks, Mark
464	FYI.
464	I am working on new procedures requiring a "budget" for outside counsel on our more complex deals to improve cost control.
464	Mark
465	Thanks.
465	Mark
466	Hi Larry: I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.
466	I think we got a gift -- I remember Susan saying something.
466	I am just the Dad!
466	Everything is going well.
466	Keep me posted on your job opportunities or if you want me to follow up with anyone here.
466	Mark
467	Joe: Thanks for the invitation.
467	I would love to be there but unfortunately I can't make it.
467	Mark
468	Only the 3 slides on power point.
468	Mark
469	Does Rob want to meet on Oct 5?
469	If yes, I want to be done by 10:00.
469	Mark
470	Yes for the choice of law but not for jurisdiction.
470	We could agree to non-exclusive jurisdiction in Ohio.
470	Mark
471	It is ok with me.
471	Mark
472	I am ok with the seminar.
472	People may have figured out other ways like self study to get their ethics hours in. Mark
473	FYI
474	FYI
475	Dave: This is for routine and "small" matters only.
475	The resolutions are drafted so that the signature authority is narrow and specific.
475	Frequency is only one factor.
475	An example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and certain defined confirms.
475	I will review the authority that has been delegated currently.
475	[Julia and Deb, please pull the existing resolutions with delegation of authority and let's review.]
476	Bonnie: Thanks for your note.
476	I would be happy to meet with you and review opportunities.
476	Give my assistant a call.
476	Mark
477	You are meeting with Bowen who has authority to hire.
477	Give me a call and we can talk through each of the people.
477	Take care.
477	Mark
478	Primary.
478	I think we should give an ultimatum to Cargill.
478	I could say that all Enron trading is to hedge risk too!
478	Mark
479	Please schedule this call.
479	Mark
480	Please give Michelle Cash a call or Karen Jones in Portland.
480	Mark
481	Set me up for a lunch or a Rockets game.
481	The tickets should be coming soon.
481	Mark
482	Please handle.
482	Mark
483	Please update me on the issues.
483	Mark
484	Please schedule something either in my office or a lunch.
484	Whatever they prefer.
484	Mark
485	Peter: Please send these updates to Lance Schuler, Travis McCullough and me going forward.
485	Mark
486	Thanks.
486	Mark
487	Pete, the report is fine.
487	Go ahead and send it out to Frevert, McMahon, Bowen and Haedicke.
487	Thanks.
487	Mark
488	I want to get this started.
488	Let's get together at the time provided below.
488	Mark
489	Do you know what this is about?
489	Mark
490	Mary: This is complicated for oil companies.
490	Mobil Exxon only does hedging.
490	Shell has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit.
490	BP Amoco is sort of in between.
490	It is very clear with respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.
490	The companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application.
490	Let me know if you need other info.
490	Mark
491	It's ok to use Blakes given the conflicts.
491	On the structure, I will forward this message to Steven Douglas and ask for his advice.
491	Mark
492	Here are a few.
492	Take care.
492	Mark
493	I am fine with your recommendations except I see no need to have an outside director if not legally required.
493	Who would you recommend as filling that director position?
493	Mark
494	FYI
495	You are the man!
495	I will be out of town on Dec 23 through 28 and March 11 through 18.
495	Mark
496	Paul: The ISDA meeting is tentatively set for Jan 18.
496	So it may be possible for me to be there on the 21st.
496	As always, the schedule could change, but I would make every effort to be there.
496	Again, congratulations!
496	Mark
497	It is ok.
497	Mark
498	Dave: Based on our discussions this morning: 1.
498	Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares.
498	The time allocation matrix will be revised during the year if material changes in the work occur.
498	2.
498	Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.
498	Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated.
498	A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all employees.
498	3.
498	Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel.
498	[Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.] Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.
498	4.
498	Reopener!
498	-- need to review where business changes significantly.
499	Dave: I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.
499	We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.
499	We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.
499	Are you in agreement?
499	Mark
500	I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.
500	My thoughts are as follows: 1.
500	We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
500	2.
500	It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed.
500	3.
500	There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
500	4.
500	Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
500	5.
500	Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.
500	Please give me your comments.
500	Mark
501	Keep me posted on this matter.
501	Mark
502	Bruce: I am tied up for lunch, but let's get together during the day on Monday or Tuesday.
502	Mark
503	It looks good to me.
503	How do we keep up with changes in a counterparty's business?
503	What if it no longer physically handles a particular commodity?
503	Mark
504	Thanks.
504	Mark
505	I will be happy to help if I can.
505	What is the timing?
505	Mark
506	Thanks.
506	Mark
507	I had a brief conversation with Vicki about splitting the costs 50/50 on the legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement.
507	She asked to use the European operation as a model.
507	At some point, Peter you should just give Vicki a call and talk it through.
507	Mark
508	Please delete me from the list.
508	Mark
509	Could you please respond for me.
509	Mark
510	I am ok with it so long as you don't spend much time at it.
510	If there is a material time commitment or the company is competing head to head with Enron, then it would be a problem.
510	Mark
511	It looks good.
511	I am in the process of confirming.
511	Mark
512	Please start working on a top ten legal risks list.
512	I want to include that list for each of your companies (EGM, EIM and ENW) in the monthly report.
512	This list should be in bullet format.
512	If you have any questions, please give me a call.
512	Mark
513	Per our conversation.
513	Mark
514	Please delete me from your e-mail list.
514	Mark
515	Not yet, but I am told they plan to fund the additional 500,000.
515	Mark
516	Please see if you and/or AGC's in your respective groups can make time to participate.
516	I have always found it to be a very rewarding experience.
516	Let me know.
516	Mark
517	The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years.
517	I think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients.
517	Within the next month, I have asked Janette to schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new organizational chart .
517	I would envision that we would focus on the following: review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources, inside and outside performance metrics In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.
517	Let me know what you think about that.
517	Mark Haedicke
518	Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?
518	The markets will be integrated, at least in part, into the US.
518	We could have an annex for Ontario.
518	We will be using the EEI form right across the border in the US.
518	Let 's chat about this.
518	Regards, Mark
519	Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one year.
519	Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to closing.
519	My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power contracts.
519	Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.
519	Please forward this memo on to the lawyers on your team.
519	Mark Haedicke
520	YES!
521	Alan, I like your suggestions.
521	Please forward your e-mail to the rest of the ogc to facilitate discussion.
521	I would like to finalize this policy next week.
521	Mark
522	I want to have a pre-telephone conference with JoAnn on what we are going to present.
522	Let's spend one half hour.
522	Mark
523	Please add to the list as number three.
523	Mark
524	Sounds good.
524	Mark
525	Your memo was well done.
525	Mark
526	Keep this as a top priority!
526	Thanks.
526	Mark
527	I will talk to Dave about this and get back to you.
527	Mark
528	I will see you for dinner.
528	Mark I assume we are talking Nit Noi off of Kirby.
528	Mark Sent by: "Ingram, Kay" Please respond to "Swanstrom, Bill"
529	For your review.
529	Mark
530	I am ok with it.
530	Mark
531	Congrats on a job well done and a successful result.
532	Any particular legal issues on these deals?
532	Mark
533	Please handle.
533	4 breakout rooms is a safe number.
533	Mark
534	I appreciate the extra work.
534	Thanks.
534	Mark
535	Travis McCullough, Richard Sanders and Michelle Cash.
535	I am still thinking about a couple more.
535	I probably need a few weeks to finalize.
535	Thanks.
535	Mark
536	Thanks for the heads up.
536	Mark
537	Elizabeth and Christian: Please brief me on what impact you believe the FERC proposed order could have on our contracts.
537	Mark
538	I was not aware of this.
538	I will investigate.
538	Thanks.
539	We want the letter on Doyle and New Albany ASAP.
539	Is there any reason we would not do the joint defense agreement.
539	Mark
540	I think this is a detrimental reliance case or fraud.
540	I want to be aggressive on this.
540	Richard, please let me know what theory is best.
540	Do we have counsel for Washington?
540	Mark
541	Thanks.
541	Mark
542	I think it is a good experience.
542	Thanks.
542	Mark
543	Mark: for your info.
543	Mark Haedicke
544	Peter: I asked Mark T to give you a call.
544	Legal questions on the financial confirms should be handled in Canada as the first option and secondly go to Houston.
544	Please talk it through with Mark T to make sure that all works.
544	Should you and Mark T talk it through with the confirm desk in Canada to make sure it is clear?
544	Regards, Mark Haedicke
545	No cc: Subject: Lexis CertiFinder Training EB47C2 at 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM on Friday, Do you have any interest in attending this?
545	Janette Elbertson Enron North America Corp. Legal Department - EB3326
546	Thanks for the offer!
546	I think I am all set.
546	Mark
547	Please see comments below.
547	Mark
548	The top ten legal risk report for EGM is new.
548	It should help focus attention on the most significant legal risks.
548	Mark
549	Richard, please review and comment asap.
549	Mark
550	Dave: I have prepared a first draft of a letter for your review.
550	Let me know if you want to make changes.
550	Regards, Mark
551	Elyse: I like the first one a lot.
551	Could we do it for this Christmas?
551	I would hate to wait a whole year.
551	I also think the last one is a good idea.
551	Let me know what I can do to help.
551	Mark
552	I think you pose an interesting legal issue.
552	I believe there is caselaw on this in the states.
552	We have a variation on this in some agreements in that if exposure exceeds x, then collateral must be posted.
552	I will be interested in the responses you get.
552	Regards, Mark
553	Janette
554	I am glad you enjoyed the game!
554	Please coordinate with Janette.
554	Mark
555	Phillippe: Please convey to your people how important it is that they monitor compliance with this policy and let me know about any violations.
555	Mark
556	It looks fine.
556	Mark
557	FYI
558	I am still working on a Spanish speaking trading lawyer.
558	One should be available by December 15.
558	Mark
559	I think we need to watch this.
559	Mark
560	Jon: Thanks!
560	I will be in London for the ISDA meeting in mid-January.
560	See you then!
560	Regards, Mark
561	Thanks Gareth!
561	Hope things are going well.
561	Mark
562	Thanks Bob!
562	Mark
563	Please register me for the flu vaccine.
563	My cost center is 105655 and my company number is 413.
563	My extension is 36544.
563	Thank you.
564	Jordan: Travis is going to give you a call about keeping up to speed on some of the year end deals.
564	Would it make sense for Travis or someone else to attend any of your staff meetings?
564	Or maybe you could attend ours or both.
564	Let me know what you think.
564	Mark
565	Paul: Is this resolved?
565	Let me know if we need to discuss further.
565	Mark Paul Simons Subject: Enron Corp - Risk Management Policy Mark Further to my voicemail, I attach the string of emails which highlights theconcern relating to personal trading by Enron staff (please see section VIIMiscellaneous - Employee Trading).
565	I appreciate you are tied up at a management conference, but if you couldpossibly get word to me on who I should speak to to resolve this, I would bvery grateful.
565	Many thanks Paul
566	Mark: I think the "Welcome" is great and have no changes.
566	Janette is sending you the org chart I want to use.
566	Thanks!
566	Mark Haedicke
567	Thanks Bob.
567	Mark
568	Thanks Jordan.
568	Mark
569	Please print out and put in my QLR binder.
569	Mark
570	no problema
571	Please review and give me your brief thoughts on this.
571	Mark
572	Thanks Bruce.
572	Have a great Thanksgiving!
572	Mark
573	Please see the review below, which I agree with.
573	Mark Greenberg is my elawexpert.
573	Mark
574	Thanks for the chart.
574	Let's get together next Monday and talk through.
574	Regards, Mark
575	John: I would like to go over the work your firm is doing for us.
575	I will ask my assistant to give you a call and set up a meeting.
575	Happy Thanksgiving!
575	Mark
576	Peter: I think your collective e-mails constitute the legal risk memo.
576	What do you think the legal risk rating ought to be?
576	Regards, Mark
577	FYI
578	Please review this memo and leave me a voice mail on the status.
578	Are we making changes suggested by our Mexican lawyers?
578	Mark
579	Travis, please look into this per my voice mail and get back to both me and Rick.
579	Mark
580	I am very interested in Steve and think we could use him in addition to Shari.
580	The only problem is that I agreed that I would not try to recruit him so the firm would agree to let us second him.
580	We just need to proceed slowly with him and hopefully it will work out to our benefit.
580	Regards, Mark
581	Please respond back with a date.
581	Thanks, Mark
582	Yes, go ahead and remove it.
582	Mark
583	Jeff, will you coordinate with Peter for the legal PRC in getting all the info on the Cd lawyers so you and I can represent them at the PRC.
584	So far, I think EWS will be an unincorporated business unit.
584	Mark
585	The person I had in mind was Fransisco Pinto-Lite.
585	He is unwinding from his old obligations.
585	I will work on an update.
585	Mark
586	John: That is fine with me.
586	See you then.
586	Mark
587	At the last minute I could not go either.
587	Hope things are going well.
587	Mark
588	Randy: You make some great points.
588	We need to sit down and talk about this further.
588	An org memo is going out today, but it does not address South America.
588	I will give you a call.
588	Regards, Mark
589	What is the status of our discussions with Carlos?
589	Mark
590	Thanks.
590	It was very helpful.
590	Mark
591	Are there year-end deals?
591	If yes, how will they be covered?
591	Let me know.
591	Thanks.
591	Mark
592	Janice: Would you please follow up on this with Bill McCoy.
592	Mark
593	Is it really necessary to coordinate everything through ENW?
593	I am not sure people will do that?
593	I think ENW should be informed but not be in control of the registration.
593	Have the ENW people requested that they be in charge of this process?
593	Will they care if we change it?
594	Let me know what the outcome of the meeting is.
594	Thanks.
594	Mark
595	I think it is great!
595	When is the best time for me to make my contribution?
595	On the radio show or before?
596	I appreciate your support.
596	Sounds like progress is being made on the deal.Thanks for all the hard work!
596	Mark cc: Subject: Re: CPS BEAR Program Mark, I do not know where I will be Monday (Washington, NYC, Bahamas, Houston)..but I would be pleased to support what looks like a good cause otherwise.Thanks, Ned PS - We closed $135MM loan w/ ExImbank last friday but do not fund until Meanwhile, McConnell is meeting the Prime Minister of Bahamas on the LNGstorage facility/Pipeline to Florida this wednesday.
597	Please schedule a meeting for Dan Fournier and David Jackson with Jim Derrick and me in Houston over the next couple of months.
597	We will probably first meet in Jim's office and then go to lunch.
597	Mark
598	Jane: ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.
598	We have heard there may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.
598	Have you heard of the earlier seminar?
598	We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go forward on the May seminar.
598	Could you look into this and talk to the traders.
598	Thanks for your help.
598	Regards, Mark
599	Looks good to me.
599	Mark
600	no problema
601	Eric: I have talked to Alan Aronowitz about this as well.
601	You need more resources immediately from inside.
601	We will also have to recruit outside to get enough resources as the business grows.
601	Regards, Mark
602	It sounds premature at this time for ISDA to put on an energy seminar in Japan.
602	Do you agree?
602	Mark
603	I am hearing that it may be premature to do an ISDA energy conference in Tokyo because almost all the products being discussed so far are physical.
603	What do you think?
603	Mark
604	Here is the memo I mentioned in our meeting today.
604	Let me know if there are other items we should put on the list.
604	Thanks.
604	Mark
605	Jim: The draft memo on power is attached.
605	Lots more work to do.
605	Let me know if you want to discuss further.
605	Mark
606	I do not think so.
606	I think he will be at Enron until he is 65.
606	Mark
607	John: I have not seen the legal opinion yet from Brazilian counsel [Dr.
607	Pinto] on our dollar indexing issue.
607	Please forward to me so I can review the opinion and get final approval for the deal.
607	Regards, Mark
608	I would not want to move forward with either unless you are a "sponsor" and believe such tools would clearly add value immediately.
608	Mark
609	We are coming in on the 22, Friday and will be leaving on the 27.
609	Good luck on the job!
609	Look forward to seeing you soon.
609	Mark
610	Bruce: I think your suggestion makes sense.
610	An e-mail or voicemail on major developments as they occur would be helpful.
610	Thanks, Mark
611	cc: Subject: E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice Could you please put me on the notification list when changes like this areimplemented?
611	I manage the field IT function for ETS.
611	My group provides support for about 1800 field employees.
611	We need to be able to roll this information out in a timely manner to those field employees.
611	Thanks.
611	If you have any questions/concerns, please feel free to call me atSue
612	Jim: I am confused.
612	LeBeouf wanted to represent ENA and EES and Reliant never came up in the conversations.
612	We picked Brobeck and it was painful for LeBoeuf.
612	I think there must be some additional facts relative to New Power.
612	Regards, Mark
613	Great job!
613	Mark
614	Please schedule.
614	Mark
615	please schedule
616	Please review the attached hypos and give me comments.
616	How do I make 2 and 3 better?
616	What other hypos should I add?
616	Maybe one geared more toward Alberta?
616	Mark
617	Peter: I have attached my work in progress to give you an idea of what I am looking for.
617	Regards, Mark
618	As a follow up to our meeting with the traders last week about litigation risks, I have drafted the attached hypos (so far) for discussion about legal risks in the changing landscape.
618	Let me know if you have any comments.
619	My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following: 1.
619	EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry development of the first master power contract.
619	The form is rapidly becoming the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically lowering costs and increasing liquidity.
619	In October, we put an EEI into place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 less than under the prior contract.
619	2.
619	New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal risks.
619	3.
619	EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training regarding all major EWS legal issues.
619	This website will reduce training costs and increase availability of training to all employees.
619	4.
619	Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com, insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia.
619	5.
619	Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA.
619	6.
619	Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power, QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets) and on and on.
619	7.
619	Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business.
619	8.
619	Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across Enron.
620	Thanks so much for your help on the BEARing gifts program!
620	It is a great cause and your help will make Christmas a lot happier for a lot of kids who really have very difficult lives.
620	Most have never received anything new.
620	Have a great holiday season!
620	Mark Haedicke
621	Thanks.
621	Have a great Christmas!
621	Mark
622	David: My first choice would be Dec 29 and second, Jan 3.
622	Let me know, I will need to schedule the time.
622	Regards, Mark
623	I would try talking to Jenny Rub.
623	She can refer you to the right person.
623	Mark
624	Yes, through Thursday.
624	Mark
625	Please make the changes marked by Sager.
625	Mark
626	I will plan on 10:00 am to noon in your Houston offices on Dec 29 unless I hear otherwise from you.
626	Thanks, Mark
627	For you to add the wire instructions which are in my out box.
627	Mark
628	I don't know what subscription she is talking about.
628	Please handle.
628	Mark
629	I am trying to change my schedule, but so far I have a conflict for the dinner in London.
629	Mark
630	Please talk to Frank and let me know how we should approach Coralina.
630	Have a happy new year!
630	Mark
631	Please review and give me your comments on the attached proposal re adopting a standard from 1 to 10 on legal risk ratings.
631	I am most concerned that the proposal works for our international transactions.
631	Let me know.
631	I would like to roll this out sometime in January.
631	Regards, Mark
632	Rob, I am still waiting for the first run of the numbers for legal.
632	I will keep you posted.
632	Mark
633	yes
634	On the commodity side of our business, there is a long list of lawsuits on commodity prices in CA.
634	This may be a committee discussion item.
634	Mark
635	The intent is that the higher the rating, the higher the legal risk.
635	I believe the jurisdictional risk is a key factor in creating legal issues even if none exist at the time the deal is done.
635	Does that make sense?
635	Stuart should be on the LC.
635	Randy is the GC of South America.
635	Mark
636	Thanks for your comments.
636	I think it would be a good idea to have Jon on as well.
636	I will add Jon and Marcus to the list.
636	Please let them know as appropriate.
636	Regards, Mark Haedicke
637	Please review and give your thoughts to me and Randy.
637	Mark
638	Why should we hold them harmless on environmental if they get their money out?
638	We would only want to provide an ENA indemnity if necessary.
638	I have asked Lisa to look at this.
638	Mark
639	I think the cut is going to be that a person runs a group.
639	Mark
640	I agree with your reasoning.
640	Mark
641	Chris: I would like to be kept up to date on who the potential candidates are.
641	We are planning on inviting Newsome to speak at our ISDA conference in March.
641	Thanks, Mark
642	Thanks for the update.
642	Good luck in NY.
642	Mark
643	What would you propose?
643	I am open to whatever makes sense.
643	Should we ask him to move to Sao Paulo?
643	Mark
644	Why wouldn't Dan see Johan's number?
644	Mark
645	Thanks for the update.
645	Sounds like things are coming together.
645	Mark
646	Randy.
646	What do other multinationals operating in Brazil do?
646	JP Morgan or Citibank?
646	Mark
647	Mark: Please handle.
647	Should Greenberg work on this?
647	Mark
648	I appreciate you making the trip to Houston.
648	Mark
649	I never heard of the company.
649	Mark
650	Please give Christian a call on this and make sure you are satisfied we not taking too great a risk.
650	Mark
651	Please find attached my draft summary relative to the above contracts.
651	Let me know if you have any corrections.
651	Mark Haedicke
652	I was convinced otherwise by Randy.
653	You are welcome.
653	Take care.
653	Mark
654	Mark: I am still coming to London, but for a very short time.
654	I would like to get together either in London on a future trip or in Houston.
654	Regards, Mark Haedicke
655	Please coordinate with Jane on this.
655	Mark
656	Jane: I have asked Mark Taylor to coordinate with you on this matter.
656	Regards, Mark
657	Please send on the Cheryl Nelson.
657	Mark
658	Thanks for the update.
658	Mark
659	Elizabeth: Please review this confirm.
659	Mark
660	Sami: Thanks for the update.
660	Mark
661	Dan: I would like to understand your business strategy.
661	I am asking my assistant to work out a time.
661	Mark
662	Elizabeth: Are you ok with it?
662	Mark
663	What is the status of your looking at the LNG contract issues?
663	Mark
664	Please set the meeting up with Alan, Dan and me.
664	Mark
665	Great job!
665	I don't have any changes.
665	Thanks.
665	Mark
666	Great job!
666	Thanks.
666	Mark
667	Dad: The name I have is Dr. Vinberg.
667	He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 80s.
667	I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good.
667	He recommended that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if it is productive.
667	His number is 713-622-1441.
667	He charges $150 per hour and I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston.
667	Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you.
667	If he is, I will propose dates and we can see if they work for everyone.
667	Love, Mark
668	I have asked Dan Lyons to give you a call on this.
668	Mark
669	Dan: I think you should add a sentence that you will continue to be directly involved in LNG matters including the contracts for Dabhol and that addtional resources are being developed in London both inside and outside.
669	Mark
670	Mark: Thanks for the info.
670	I had a great time at the football game!
670	I think you will like Dubai.
670	It has some great restaurants.
670	Regards, Mark
671	Jane: Thanks for the update.
671	It is very important for our traders to understand the documentation challenges.
671	Mark
672	Janette: Please make contact with the gem broker below and set a time where I can meet him and look at some topaz, emeralds and opals.
672	I want to look at loose stones.
672	I may need to talk to him before I go.
672	Mark
673	Frank: I am not in favor of this promotion.
673	I think in the new environment that it could be negative for him.
673	Let's talk about it.
673	Mark
674	Alan: This makes sense to me.
674	Please get with John or send your e-mail to him and see if this matter can be resolved quickly.
674	Mark
675	J: yes.
675	Mark
676	Janette: Schedule some time for me to go to this gallery.
676	Maybe early Wednesday afternoon.
676	Mark
677	Thanks.
677	I want to go to the gallery.
677	Mark
678	Bryan: Bob's number is 212-332-2554.
678	Let me know your impressions after the meeting.
678	Mark
679	The agenda of the ISDA conference that Greg is the keynote speaker at is attached.
679	Mark
680	Travis
681	I would love to do that but I have a commitment on Saturday night in Houston.
681	Thanks for looking into it for me.
681	Next time.
681	See you next week.
681	Mark
682	Matt: Congratulations on your wedding plans!
682	I am sorry I cannot make it!
682	Mark
683	Does it still make sense to have these meetings anymore?
683	Maybe just sit in on Novak's meeting.
683	Mark Haedicke
684	Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.
684	It seems like overkill to recruit just for shipping.
684	Regards, Mark Haedicke
685	I am not sure why that is.
685	Non-trading work is off a little so maybe that is it.
685	Be sure to touch base with Lance Schuler about the work he sees coming up.
685	I am happy to talk about it.
685	Mark
686	Please keep Lance Schuler and me up to speed on these issues.
686	Thanks.
686	Mark
687	Thanks.
687	I put the risk at a 2.
687	Mark
688	Yes, send a resume to Julia Murray.
688	Mark
689	Wow!
689	Things can change quickly.
689	Thanks.
689	Mark
690	I am available as a last resort.
690	I have asked Alan Aronowitz who is the GC of Enron Global Markets to make a presentation.
690	I will let you know.
690	Mark
691	Thanks for pointing that out.
691	Mark
692	Congratulations!
692	Mark Haedicke
693	J: include this org chart with the memo.
693	Mark
694	Let's send it out today.
694	Mark
695	Rob: How can we get some relief on this issue?
695	Should we set up a call with Peter and me?
695	There really is an earnings impact.
695	Let me know.
695	Regards, Mark Haedicke
696	It's ok with me.
696	Mark
697	No need to do a risk memo if the legal risk rating would be a 1.
697	Is that what this one would be?
697	Mark
698	The report is well done.
698	For my purposes it could be much shorter -- really in a bullet list format.
698	Thanks.
698	Mark
699	John: What is the status on this?
699	I now have Eddie Daniels dedicated full time to Cuiba.
699	Hopefully that will help you some.
699	Regards, Mark
700	Rex: We are trying to make this as limited as possible.
700	Can you define specifically what requires an exception?
700	I am the signoff for the wholesale group, but it makes sense to be consistent across Enron.
700	Regards, Mark
701	Rob: Thanks.
701	I will ask Janette to set up a call for you, me and Peter on the guarantees.
701	Mark
702	I am happy to meet with them.
702	We will want them to meet Jim Derrick as well.
702	Mark
703	Yes.
703	They are a great company to get in ISDA.
703	Mark
704	No problem.
704	Mark
705	Sylvia: I think there should be a cost center for each of ENA, EGM, EIM, ESA and EGA, which tracks the org chart of people reporting directly to me.
705	Deb Korkmas can help you with the proper account numbers.
705	Mark
706	found it.
706	Mark
707	I am taking steps to retain the lawyers we have and supplement with more Brazilian lawyers and lawyers in Houston.
707	Big challenge to get all the work done.
707	Mark
708	Yes, I will go to this dinner.
708	I do need to leave on Tuesday at about 1:00 pm.
708	Mark
709	Yes, for the time being until we get someone in Alan's group.
709	Mark
710	How did it turn out with Francisco?
710	Mark
711	Jim: Here is the background of the "dispute" with Blakes.
711	There is a lot of emotion on both sides.
711	I believe we need Blakes on a going forward basis in Canada.
711	Mark Haedicke
712	I think it is a good opportunity to promote standardized contracts.
712	Mark
713	Bob: The person to ask would be Mark Evans in London.
713	Let's get together for lunch sometime when you are in Houston.
713	Mark
714	Ruth: The press release looks fine.
714	Mark
715	Ann K is working on this now.
715	Thanks.
715	Mark
716	I am willing to do this on the 20th, but only for one hour maximum.
716	See if Jim has any interest and then get back to Peter.
716	Mark
717	please set up.
717	Mark
718	Chris: Thanks for the message.
718	I appreciate the feedback.
718	I know she has been working particularly hard lately!
718	We are working to add resources, but that is not easy.
718	Thanks for your support.
718	Mark
719	I am confused by this.
719	Does this mean Cuiaba in South America would be covered?
719	What is the significance if it is?
719	Mark
720	Does Matt have time to do all the LNG work?
720	My guess is that he may have the time.
720	Mark
721	Thanks for raising the issue.
721	Keep me posted!
721	Mark
722	Do you have any comments on this contract?
722	Please let me and Chris know.
722	Mark
723	Mark: I would like to get together at the AGM.
723	I will ask my assistant to work on a time would could meet and propose that to you.
723	Hope things are going well.
723	Mark Haedicke
724	Thanks.
724	Please don't hold up the meeting for me but if possible I will attend.
724	Mark
725	Peter: As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.
725	I don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in Canada.
725	I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.
725	We can't ignore that.
725	Let's generally talk that through with Jim.
725	Regards, Mark
726	Greg: Thanks.
726	Was a dash done on this?
726	Mark
727	Shouldn't you and Rick do that together so as not to have confusion.
727	Mark
728	Thanks.
729	Approved for Janette Elbertson to go to Outlook 1082 on 3/29/01 from 1-2 p.m.
730	I would think the change in the business direction requires a different skiset.
730	Is that an appropriate response?
730	cc: Subject: FW: The power of why John and Mark -- Your thoughts?
731	I am ok with it for the spot deals.
731	Mark
732	Please schedule lunch in late April.
732	Mark
733	Tim: Thanks!
733	I am working on getting Steve even more locked up.
733	Mark
734	John: I gave you a rewrite of Redman's list and the percentages.
734	I will send it again in case it got lost.
734	Mark
735	Yes, thanks.
735	Mark
736	Let's catch up when you get back to Houston.
736	We can go to lunch or set up time to meet in the office.
736	Mark
737	Put this meeting on my schedule.
737	Mark
738	I don't have a problem with it, subject to our normal litigation exception.
738	Mark
739	Not much should overlap with our agenda.
739	Thanks.
739	Mark
740	It may be too late now, but I would like to meet with them.
740	Mark
741	Eddy: Let's get together and go over the agenda before the meeting.
741	Thanks.
741	Mark
742	Great news!
742	Thanks.
742	Mark
743	Eddy: Please call into this meeting to see if it is worth while for us.
743	Ma|
744	FYI: Consider the agenda below and how we can get ISDA to help us in Brazil.
744	Mark
745	Please put on my schedule.
745	Mark
746	Put this on my schedule for tomorrow.
746	Mark
747	Thanks for the ideas!
747	Mark
748	Bob: I am going to pass on the playoff tickets.
748	Thanks.
748	Mark
749	I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.
749	I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.
749	I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.
749	Mark
750	Let me know if anyone in your group is interested.
750	Mark
751	I think New York is a fair compromise, for North American transactions.
751	Litigating in London is very expensive so I think that is not a good alternative.
751	Mark
752	It looks great.
752	Mark
753	Your comments
754	Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in California.
754	In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " future California", we propose the following changes: 1.
754	Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.
754	Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.
754	2.
754	Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put in place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.
754	3.
754	Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.
754	Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.
754	4.
754	No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on "inability to pay debts as they become due".
754	Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.
754	I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.
754	The long range goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.
755	Louise: Is Enron ready for this?
755	I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.
755	It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.
755	I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.
755	Let's talk about what are the objectives.
755	Great question!
755	Mark
756	Add my name as a person to contact.
756	Mark
757	No problema.
758	Print out?
758	Mark
759	You should continue to sign the dashes and just alert me to any matter going to Frevert or Whalley.
759	Thanks.
759	Mark
760	Yes.
761	John: Keep me posted on this matter.
761	Thanks.
761	Mark
762	J: please put this on my calender tomorrow.
762	Mark
763	Yes.
764	Please send out the attached memo that Julia prepared.
764	Mark
765	Go State!
766	I will pass on it.
766	Thanks.
766	Mark
767	call janette.
767	Mark
768	Sorry.
768	My schedule does not permit that change.
768	Mark
769	This is way too much of a commercial!
769	Two thirds of it speaks only to Kiodex.
769	Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.
769	He said he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward new commodities.
769	He needs to do more.
769	Mark
770	Greg Piper raised the following questions: Is ENW a marketing affiliate?
770	Is EOL a marketing affiliate?
770	Sally Beck's organization?
770	Can Beck's organization process transactions for CMS pipelines?
770	Could Sally use ETS resources to do processing for CMS?
770	Greg is looking for some guidance by Tuesday.
770	Let's discuss.
770	Mark
771	Sound like California.
771	I noticed that the UK power book is doing well too.
771	Regards, Mark
772	J: Please print these out for me and put in my packet for the trip.
772	Mark
773	J: Please save an electronic copy of this presentation in case I want to use any of the slides in the future.
773	Mark
774	Bob: What is the view in general re arbitration of Brazilian companies?
774	Should we expect many objections to our new policy?
774	Don't get many objections in the US.
774	Mark
775	Please get this to Mark Frevert.
775	Mark
776	I think Avista should be primary.
776	I don't know Kangqi.

781	Mark cc: Subject: RE: Hainan Good news is hard to come by these days in the Enron emerging market world so I thought that I would pass this along.
781	We still need to work on repatriation/conversion issues to get our money oubut at least it sits safely in an Enron account in the meantime.
781	Bill Krenz worked very hard on this matter under trying circumstances.
781	Thehead of the HEPCO negotiating team through a cup at our business guy, DonBunnell, and shattered a tea pot.

787	Mark
788	Sami: What is the net net of the new policy?
789	Please handle.
789	I think you should send an email to the OGC and ask if they are aware of any such contracts.
789	Mark
790	How would we do this efficiently in EWS?
790	Mark
791	Please set a meeting to talk through this contract with Sami.

829	By its terms, we have until Friday to confirm our agreement.
829	The key termsare: 1.
829	EOL third-party transaction data will be included in the index on a real-time basis; 2.
829	Other electronic trading systems may have their data included in the index if they meet the criteria for inclusion (similar product, audit rights) (i.we deleted the "most favour nations" requirement for inclusion of other systems not being on more favourable terms); 3.
829	Enron pays a one-time C$25,000 set-up fee; 4.
829	Enron pays an index management fee of C$5,000 per month, unless Enron trades at least 50,000 TJ,s per month on NGX; 6.
829	Enron pays normal NGX trading fees; 7.
829	Enron pays no audit fees or other fees or costs; 8.
829	Lawsuit is released with everybody bearing their own costs; 9.
829	Enron agrees to confidential audit rights to independent auditor ) but no customer information is provided to NGX; 10.
829	No non-compete.
829	Enron is expressly allowed to: (a) develop, establish, publish or promote any alternative or competing index: (b) post, settle against, or use in any transaction, any alternative or competing index; (c) provide information to Gas Daily and Inside FERC, etc; (d) display any transactional information on EOL; 11.
829	Term is 3 years, commencing after information transfer systems are inplace, but not later than Dec. 31 (failing which lawsuit is revived, but against NGX only); 12.
829	Enron can terminate at any time on 60 days notice (but lawsuit is released); 13.
829	Enron can terminate at any time for NGX breach (lawsuit is revived, butagainst NGX only); 14.
829	NGX can change its products and Enron has the option to change and beincluded or not to change; 15.
829	The method for calculating and compiling the index cannot be changed inthe future without our approval, and the agreements between NGX and Enerdata which give NGX the rights to the index cannot be amended or terminated without our consent; 16.
829	Deal is subject to ENA senior management approval by Friday; and 17.
829	The above has been approved and executed by NGX, OM, Enerdata and This has been a tremendous amount of work with little involvement by outsidcounsel.
829	Both Rob and I believe it is an excellent deal for Enron given thfact that pursuing the lawsuit will be extremely costly (both in terms ofexpenses and the time and effort of dedicating resources to the litigation)and difficult to litigate.
829	The deal really amounts to an option to Enron thave its EOL data included in the index for C$25,000 and releasing the lawsuit.
829	Please let me know by Friday if we want to execute.
829	Regards, Peter.
830	I will be out of town that day.
830	Maybe the next one.
830	Mark
831	No problem with the no litigation exception.
831	Mark
832	Let's have Lance attend.
832	Mark
833	Next week, I will be in only on Monday.
833	I want Lance to sign dash if it comes later in the week.
833	Mark
834	Here are my thoughts so far: 1.
834	Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 2.
834	Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week 3.
834	Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months 4.
834	Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA 5.
834	Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval 6.
834	Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot be hedged
835	FYI
836	I think we will need to do something for Peter.
836	I would be interested in HRs view on how much.
836	Mark
837	The lawyers had a kick-off meeting today.
837	Vicki and I echoed your point on not shutting down the business.
837	We have a great team assembled and I think it will calm down the traders in EWS.
837	I will keep you posted.
837	Mark Haedicke
838	Not clear at this point.
838	No deals have been done.
838	My guess is that it will be Lance and his group.
838	I will let you know when it gets sorted out.
838	Mark
839	Please review and set up a meeting with me to establish a plan for this committee.
839	Mark
840	Stacy and Ruth: I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee: 1.
840	convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue this 2.
840	California energy issues/solutions 3.
840	standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff, netting, termination, etc. 4.
840	bankruptcy 5.
840	CFTC study of retail derivatives 6.
840	emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc. Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference.
840	Let me know what you think.
840	Regards, Mark Haedicke
841	I am ok with it.
841	Mark Haedicke
842	please handle.
842	Mark
843	Why don't you sign the opinion.
843	Let's get together later in the week.
843	I have some ideas to pitch to you.
843	Mark
844	Looks great!
844	Change the company to Enron Wholesale Services and send it out.
844	Mark
845	Please set a meeting for Mark Taylor and me wih ISDA.
845	Mark
846	I need at least 5 years of experience.
846	Mark
847	That makes sense.
847	Thanks.
847	Mark
848	Great questions!
848	It is fine with me if you would like to distribute them.
848	I may cover some in the floor talk.
848	Thanks for the help.
848	Mark
849	I want to be involved as we are in the process of signing up employment contracts with Sami Arap, Louise Wantanabe and Vicki Martinez.
849	John Novak and I need to approve all the changes.
849	Thanks.
849	Mark
850	Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside FERC.
850	It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential.
850	We want the data to be as good as possible.
850	If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations.
850	Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US.
851	Glad to have you as an employee of Enron!
851	Mark
852	Delayed.
852	I prepared an outline but have made no progress beyond that.
852	Nothing will be available this summer.
852	Regards, Mark
853	Looks ok to me.
853	Mark
854	We need to address both issues unless there is some compelling reason not to.
854	Mark
855	Best wishes at AEP!
855	Mark
856	The right person is Sami Arap in Sao Paulo.
856	Mark Haedicke
857	Mark: It looks like Paul Simons got a copy of this e-mail.
857	Let me know if it is useful to work with ISDA on any of these matters.
857	Mark Haedicke
858	Put this as tentative on my schedule.
858	Mark
859	Great!
859	John L said he was going to leave legal to us.
859	So please take the lead in proposing changes for the legal team and propose the changes to me so we can get it done.
859	Regards, Mark
860	I loved it!
860	Mark
861	I am willing to wear the risk.
861	Remember, my $100.
861	Mark
862	Are these correct?
862	Please let John know.
862	Mark
863	Type:Single Meeting Time Zone:Central Time (US & Canada)
864	I am fine with the agenda except that I will have E. Sager talk about the trading forms.
864	Mark
865	Elizabeth: Does the RTO order require a task force to draft new language?
865	Let me know.
865	Mark
866	Please join me for a baseball game.
866	The Astros are playing the NY Mets on Wednesday, August, 1.
866	The game starts at 7:05 p.m.
866	Please RSVP to Janette by e-mail to let her know if you will be able to attend.
866	(Unfortunately due to the limited number of seats available in a suite, we were not able to extend this invitation to your spouse or significant other.) Hope to see you there!
867	My accomplishments for the first six months of 2001 include the following: 1.
867	Developed New EES Trading Forms -- provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite EES forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms.
867	2.
867	Developed Setoff and Netting Strategy in the PG&E Bankruptcy -- led legal and credit team across all Enron entities in minimizing Enron credit and legal risks.
867	This required an expedited evaluation of Enron positions and coordination across Enron entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all PG&E contracts.
867	3.
867	Implemented New Document Retention Policy for Microsoft Outlook -- led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in Enron.
867	4.
867	Thought Leader on Legal Risk Managment -- continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across Enron.
867	Legal Risk Memos and legal risk ratings are two examples.
867	These legal risk policies have been newly applied in South America and EES to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses.
867	5.
867	Developing New Businesses -- integral part in developing new businesses in freight, paper, steel, lumber, etc. by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks.
867	6.
867	Deal Machine -- projects having lots of complex issues including LV Cogen II, Pastoria, Sithe, Invasion Energy, Electrobolt and Huntco.
867	7.
867	Management -- continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses.
867	8.
867	New Generation of Master Agreeements -- taking the lead with ISDA in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities, whether physical or financial.
867	This would reduce the legal work by half.
868	Type:Single Meeting Time Zone:Central Time (US & Canada)
869	I think it is something we watch closely as you suggest.
869	Mark
870	Travis and I will cover the suggested topics.
870	Mark
871	I am ok as long as you and Alan are ok.
871	Mark
872	Thanks.
872	I will try!
872	Mark
873	Thanks Paul.
873	Mark
874	Sami, by copy hereof, I have asked Jeff Hodge to look into this matter.
874	He is at 36911.
874	Mark
875	Thanks for the message.
875	I would e-mail Alan Aronowitz.
875	Regards, Mark
876	FYI, Mark
877	Don, we are looking into this.
877	I wonder how traders operate in LA.
877	Mark
878	Let's discuss.
878	Mark
879	Yes, so long as they are employees and not on contract.
879	Move them to Lance Schuler's group.
879	Mark
880	Richard is looking into whether we can tape in Houston or Portland and have a CA person on the line.
880	Mark
881	I have a few thoughts on the offsite.
881	I think we could have a theme of restructuring and change.
881	We would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future.
881	The presentations could include the following: 1.
881	What we learned in CA -- Sager 2.
881	Preparing for workouts -- Mellencamp 3.
881	Lessons learned in international -- Lundstrom 4.
881	Deregulation of energy markets -- Kean/Shapiro 5.
881	Managing Legal Risks -- Haedicke 7.
881	Europe presentation 8.
881	Retail presentation
882	Looks fine to me.
882	Thanks.
882	Mark
883	Mark and John: The Wholesale legal conference is coming up soon.
883	I wanted to get a head count and the names of the attendees from each of you.
883	For planning purposes, I have assumed 5 lawyers from each of your groups.
883	Let me know.
883	Also, are there any European or South American topics you would suggest we cover?
883	So far, we have Whalley and Frevert signed up to give us a business update.
883	Regards, Mark
884	John, thanks for the message.
884	I think, I would like to plan a trip and discuss the issues in person at GE.
884	Early October would work for me.
884	Regards, Mark Haedicke
885	We had a great time and got home without a hitch!
885	Thanks!
885	Mark
886	put on my schedule.
886	Mark
887	Stacy: I would like to know who on the committee is willing to spend time and resources on what issues.
887	I think that is critical.
887	Thanks.
887	Mark
888	Thanks, I will send a copy to Alan in EGM.
888	Mark
889	Per our conversation yesterday, I propose we send out the following memo: In order to better coordinate the various west coast power matters, effective immediately, Jim Steffes and Richard Sanders will jointly take the lead role.
889	Jim and Richard will be responsible for preparing a comphrehensive strategy for all the matters, reviewing the strategy with the California Committee and seeking approval of the California Committee before taking any material action.
889	Please do all you can to assist Jim and Richard on the west coast power matters.
889	I would copy only the people working on these matters including Steffes, Sanders, Belden, Mellencamp, Shapiro, Sharp, Williams, Tribolet, Lavorato and Delainey.
890	Steve: Per our conversation, I would like to talk about "Managing Legal Risks".
890	I think it would follow the RAC presentation.
890	I want to talk through the system of legal risk memos and legal risk ratings we have used on wholesale deals for two years with great success.
890	There is a very important risk control aspect to legal that needs to be highlighted.
890	Let me know if you need more information.
890	Regards, Mark
891	Just do the best you can.
891	We will probably end up moving it to a different day.
891	Mark
892	Yes.
892	They are fine.
892	Mark
893	Thanks for the kind words.
893	Mark
894	I am working on it.
894	Mark
895	I want to go through a list of each counterparty we think is going to go into bankruptcy and what we are doing to prepare for that.
895	Thanks.
895	Mark
896	I agree.
896	Mark
897	Mary: The company seems to have a bad reputation.
897	I don't know if Marc Rich owns any portion of it or not because it is private.
897	I think, the UK started some investigations re Glencore over the past couple of years.
897	I am not sure we want the company as part of ISDA.
897	I am sure others will have an opinion on that.
897	Mark
898	Thanks Rob.
898	Mark
899	Have we put the updated netting language in the contract?
899	Would it ever come into play?
899	Regards, Mark
900	Peter: This is a tough battle.
900	It may be worse because your clients are either the same ones or geographically very close.
900	I would try to address it by pointing out the limitations of the simplier forms and as a fallback emphasize the increased risk (legal and otherwise) when using the shorter forms.
900	Mark
901	J, please get this message ready to send from me to the Specialists.
901	Mark
902	I have asked J to send it out.
902	Mark
903	I will be attending.
903	Mark Haedicke
904	Andy: Can you look into this while Richard is out of the office.
905	Thanks for the message.
905	Mark
906	Greg: It has been 120 days for voice mail that is not deleted.
906	It should be further reduced to 7 days.
906	Mark Haedicke
907	Thanks!
907	Yes, please keep me off the Section 16 list!
907	Mark
908	Calpine in ok.
908	Mark
909	Dave, in the Dunn Committee case, we just got a great order in our favor out of the courts.
909	We need to try to leverage off this order to slow down the AG.
909	Mark
910	That sounds positive.
910	Mark
911	J: Please forward this on to the Enron employees that plan events.
911	Shira is a family friend and I would recommend her.
911	Also give me a status report.
911	Mark
912	I am stuck in London -- hope to get out Sunday.
912	Nice to hear from you.
912	Mark
913	I am stuck in London.
913	I will attend either in person or by video from our London office.
913	Mark Haedicke
914	Thanks.
914	Let's get together after the end of the quarter and discuss.
914	Mark
915	J: Please add this to our spiral bound book.
915	Mark
916	Yes.
916	I was very lucky to get back Saturday!
916	Mark
917	That makes sense.
917	How do we notify our trading counterparties?
917	Mark
918	Not necessary.
918	Thanks.
918	Mark
919	Scott Tholan.
919	Regards, Mark
920	I will call.
920	Thanks.
920	M
921	Rob: Congratulations!
921	We will need to talk about some additional coordination.
921	Let me know when is convenient for you.
921	Mark
922	I am ok so long as the firm would never pursue litigation against Enron -- on that basis I would grant the waiver.
922	Mark
923	Congrats!
923	Thanks for your help.
923	Mark
924	Rosalee: Mark Taylor and I can get this done through Enron Net Works.
924	Thanks.
924	Mark Haedicke
925	Thanks Derek.
925	Mark
926	Thanks for inviting me.
926	I unfortunately will not be able to attend.
926	Regards, Mark Haedicke
927	I am doing well!
927	I look forward to catching up.
927	I do plan to play golf so it would be great to play together.
927	Regards, Mark
928	I am disappointed on the timing but I understand.
928	Thanks.
928	Mark
929	Liz: Greg is scheduled to speak on Friday, October 12 at 8:30 am for 30-45 minutes.
929	No slides are necessary.
929	The lawyers will be interested in where Greg sees the growth in the company and where the business is strong.
929	There will be Q&A and I think he will get some good questions.
929	Some possible questions: What does Greg expect from the legal department?
929	How will the attacks impact on our business?
929	What will be his focus in his new job?
929	It should be a very friendly crowd -- since Greg knows most of the lawyers and they know him.
929	I miss you too!
929	Mark Haedicke
930	Look forward to the discussion.
930	Mark
931	It looks like a great program.
931	Mark
932	Mark, Justin, Paul: Do you have any comments on the agenda?
932	Let me know and I will forward them on.
932	Mark
933	There are some more developments re Bob that we should talk about.
933	Mark
934	It can wait his return.
934	Please ask him if he is available to speak on Dec 4 at the conference.
934	Mark
935	I don't know of any now.
935	Mark
936	Thanks for the offer.
936	I cannot use them either.
936	Mark
937	Very impressive.
937	Mark
938	I would love to, but I cannot.
938	Thanks for the offer.
938	You should be getting a call today from one of our lawyers re a potential deal.
938	Take care.
938	Mark
939	Dear John: I am proud of MSU and would like to help.
939	I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to talk through your questions over the next week.
939	Regards, Mark Haedicke
940	Louise: I talked to Jim and we have worked through a revised strategy as we talked about yesterday.
940	So no call from Jim.
940	Mark
941	John: Should we get you, Scott and me (and Teresa Bushman) together to flesh out the deal further for the term sheet?
941	Teresa and I have worked on a term sheet but it is pretty bare bones so far?
941	Mark
942	[Haedicke, Mark E.] J , please arrange for a meeting.
942	It is ok for it to be lunch.
942	Mark
943	Thanks, I will have my assistant call to set a date and time.
943	Mark
944	I will be on the telephone on this one because of a management meeting the same day.
944	Mark
945	Lisa: What is the quality of our contracts and do we hold any collateral?
945	Any particular legal issues at this point?
945	Will we have to get quotes?
945	Mark
946	Yes.
946	Thanks!!!
946	Mark
947	Sounds like a great result!
947	Congratulations.
947	Mark
948	Looks good to me.
948	Mark
949	no problem
950	morale, deal flow, how the open plan is working
951	Should we try Akin Gump?
951	What is your recommendation off the list?
951	Mark
952	Thanks for the offer, but otherwise occupied.
952	Regards, Mark
953	Did we talk about the cap on breakage fee?
953	Mark Haedicke
954	Where did we come out on a cap on breakage fee?
954	Mark Haedicke
955	Mark Haedicke
956	Is there anything I need to work on tonight?
956	What is the schedule tonight?
956	Mark
957	John: There is a conflict of interest in Thompson having all the info and selling to a group formed by him and other employees.
957	We need to talk this through.
957	Maybe, he should take a leave of absence.
957	Should Jesus negotiate the deal for ENA?
957	Selling to employees is sensitive now.
957	Mark
958	Please handle.
958	Mark0 Mark Haedicke
959	We will get you a summary soon.
959	Mark Mark Haedicke
960	Clem: Thanks for raising that question because it is very important that we are coordinated.
960	I have forwarded this question on to Jordan and I think he and I need to work together on this matter.
960	Perhaps the three of us should get on the telephone to resolve.
960	Mark
961	Coordination is a major problem at Enron.
961	You are asking all the right questions.
961	Mark
962	Sami: Please set some time on my schedule tomorrow to talk this through.
962	Mark
963	I think it wii be about 7 or 8?
963	Dad Mark Haedicke
964	Justin, I do not think I am going to nyc.
964	Love Dad Mark Haedicke
965	Good luck.

966	Mark Haedicke
967	Jim: I want to put Aronowitz for ENA as well as EGM.
967	He will get an assist from Sager but he will lead.
967	Mark
968	Who rejected your plan?
968	The view I heard is that the proposal was too rich.
968	Are you looking for a counterproposal?
968	Mark
969	Jim: The last sentence was changed to "we expect you to perform".
969	Mark

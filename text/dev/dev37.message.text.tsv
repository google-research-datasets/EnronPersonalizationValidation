0	Please send Pam Benson the information for Joe on where to send the check, who to make it out to , etc
1	Another bit of background re Frankfurt (see below).
1	I would be a little bimore insistent on German Consulate support than Herr Sturm suggests (otherwise this could become a black hole for your time).
2	Per my voicemail.
3	I have also received regrets from Horton, but confirmation from Metts
4	Anybody at the CFTC or on the hill we want to send brochures to?
5	I will attend.
6	I wuold like to attend if my calendar is open
7	Any problem?
7	please advise Don.
8	I agree with Mark's points.
8	While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.
8	Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.
8	We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.
8	Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or
9	We can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is focussed on developing IT systems for bulk power systems: We need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having IT solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work.
9	The IT firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers (domestic and international) whose decisions will make the IT firm's systems either successful or obsolete.
9	Call me if you would like to discuss.
10	Mary -- see attached
11	There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro project.
11	The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it, but we are not going to.
11	Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are not pursuing the project.
11	Kelly will also be getting in touch with David Howe.
11	I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting questions.
12	I appreciate you pressing this issue.
12	You should both be aware that Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in Pakistan a couple of years ago.
12	Their claim is that the company did not provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the region.
13	Please respond and copy me.
14	A typical utility luncheon.
15	I don't really have a problem with this, but I thought that all VP promotions were supposed to go through our year end process.
15	That's what I have been saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.
15	Ken, being newly back in the fold, likely didn't know about the process.
16	FYI.
16	These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about.
17	I will be out of town that day (a meeting I can't move).
17	Please continue to let me know about future meetings.
17	Lora Sullivan@ENRON
18	A "dedicated room" isn't as bad as it sounds.
18	It would not be in use full time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already have).
18	Let me know what you think.
18	Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving deeper into her group (and next to her files)).
19	Looks good.
19	Some of his questions suggest he's going to include a fair amount of industry reaction -- which could be a mixed bag, some are clearly threatened by efficiencies in bw markets.
19	Looks like it will be a really good story.
19	He definitely appears to be excited by it.
20	yes -- just make sure the working group leaders know.
21	I won't be able to attend.
21	Let me know if I need to be hooked up by phone or if you will just brief me afterward.
22	Looks like a full slate; you're off to a great start.
22	Maureen -- please put times and locations on my calendar as an fyi.
23	Typo in second paragraph ..
23	should be companies not company
24	Is Catherine working on environmental policy related to sustainability or is she working on greenhouse gas transactions .

24	or both?
25	I'll send it back on Tuesday.
26	It looks like Enron Japan was kept in the loop.
26	Let's keep it up.
26	Good luck
27	On the advice of my much esteemed spouse, I would like to express great interest in this group.
27	Thanks
28	Please put on my calendar and call to confirm my attendance.
28	thanks
29	Am I taking care of you or what??
30	Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.
30	The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway.
30	By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.
30	I know the Southern cone team is moving to make it right, but I see absolutely no reason to come don on anyone about this.
31	Please add Terrie to the meeting with Beth, Bill, Palmer, et al
32	FYI
33	Okay, so I didn't know what a "DRIP" is, but now that I do, I'm sending this to you.
34	FYI
35	Any of the following would be great (prop ref no.): TUS-020-02 (the last one on your list) I would prefer one with a tennis court in the complex.
35	Go ahead and book.
35	Thanks!
36	Rosie and Sherrie: Jeff Ken and Joe wanted to discuss the attached.
36	Joe -- this is the same document I forwarded to you earlier.
37	I'm normally not a big fan of conferences, but this one may be of interest.
37	I think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak: it's possible some utilities may say some of the same things we would say, but they may be less likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond.
37	Let me know what you think.
38	What are our chances of final approval at FERC at the JUly meeting.
38	Jeff still thinks this is a third quarter close.
38	Do we have any chance of making that happen?
39	My copy shows long term comp on the exhibit under "Grant Award".
39	And yes, the date will be revised.
40	Forgive me if I have forgotten, but had you suggested a topic for our next advisory council meeting?
41	I understood the "validation" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches.
41	What we specifically discussed, and what scott s.
41	left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates.
41	We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.
41	I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.
41	In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).
41	Let's just get this done.
42	Let's process this request.
42	I think it's justified.
43	I need you to run these items by Rick.
43	I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO.
43	In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities.
43	My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going.
43	If we have specifically committed to certain things, then let's follow through.
43	If there are things we can avoid, let's avoid them.
43	Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.
43	With respect to the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions?
43	These are the kinds of things we need to consider.
44	I agree with Rick.
44	I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input will be important.
44	To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc. That information is essential but it is, as you know, about 10% of the issue.
44	The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.
44	I think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments.
45	do I need to do anything?
45	I believe the only transaction I had was related to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.
45	Some of the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution.
45	We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a filing.
45	Could you confirm by e-mail?
46	Do you have an "alumni" list of analysts/associates in key positions at Enron?
47	I think the message Christi prepared is great.
47	Check with her one last time and then let it go.
48	Congratulations!
49	Yes, you are.
50	Thanks for the message.
51	That's OK, I was going to use it in the presentation, but it wasn't essential.
51	Was my talk what you were looking for?
52	I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues.
52	I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake.
52	Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.
52	I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora.
52	I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.
52	If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.
52	I look forward to the discussion.
52	Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON
53	Any follow up questions or India press about the bloomeberg story I sent you yesterday?
54	Joe asked me to get in touch with you regarding Indian media reports/inquiries on possible sale or sell down of Dabhol and to discuss a possible statement in the event we get additional inquiries.
54	Give me a call
55	I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.
55	This gives them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got price protection".
55	On the messages we need to include Mark's top three: 1) price caps cause shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together)
56	I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts .
56	.
56	.
56	it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection.
56	The messages need to include Palmer's top three: 1) price caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems.
56	On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . . ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).
57	I do not.
57	Enron Energy Services
58	Preliminary congratulations!.
58	Looks like a good plan.
58	Keep me posted.
59	I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.
59	We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.
59	the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement, not after the group gets underway.
59	Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?
59	Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON
60	Wow!
60	Was this expected?
61	Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records?
61	It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts.
61	Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.
61	What do you think?
62	I still need to talk to you about our public message in India.
62	I am on my way to Calgary tonight.
62	My hotel number is 403-266-7331.
62	Thanks.
63	Thanks for the referral.
63	We definitely want to get our story out to these guys.
63	Just for future reference, Meredith Phillipp is handling "New Media" for us.
63	Thanks
64	Strong work, Laura!
65	Will we capture these "accelerations" in our accomplishments?
66	Baby, I'm going to San Francisco on Aug 14?(Sunday) returning Wednesday.
66	Wanna go??
67	Attached are my comments on the Bliley amendment to the Largent amendment.
68	Let's add this to our daily distribution.

70	In the underscored language added to the RTO section I would insert "access to" between the words "planning" and "maintenance".
70	Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON
71	Let's take the opportunity.
71	Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON
72	I do too, but I think you should send it with the appropriate caveats (which I communicated verbally to her).
73	Fine
74	Looks good.
75	looks good
76	I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.
76	Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to).
76	That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.
76	Rob Wilson@ENRON
77	My message was sent before I finished it.
77	I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay -- what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries.
77	I also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact.
77	I believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences.
77	Good luck with your studies.
77	My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.
77	Rob Wilson@ENRON
78	Thanks for the update.
78	Congratulations on your progress.
79	Please do send it out.
79	Thanks for the kind words.
79	I know you know how I feel about your work and I have shared that view widely.
79	I have enjoyed working with you; I always valued your insights , your responsiveness, and your work ehtic.
79	I wish you all the best in your new role.
80	These are good fixes.
80	I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly.
81	Sherrie and Rosie: Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about designating portions of their contributions for use in Texas.
81	Mr. DeLay would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint letter).
81	It is, of course, up to Ken and Jeff whether to make the designation.
82	Lou -- you may be maxed out on Franks now.
82	Don't write a check for the August fundraiser until you have talked to Eliz Labanowski
83	If you think this is worth pursuing, get in touch with Christie.
84	Offer him the job.
84	Rob Bradley@ENRON
85	What do you think?
86	I think you, or someone in your group, should cover this.
86	The attendees are operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting, interconnection and environmental issues.
86	Also, from a more macro perspective, what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on operators -- the importance of flexibility in asset operations (ie the premium the market will place on quick response) or the challenges of different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets.
87	Maybe we should knock down the walls of those cavernous offices on the topfloor.
88	I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 years from commercial production.
88	Ideally, we could get that confirmation from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest in its success.
88	Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough to recognize the potential shortcomings.
88	I want to feel comfortable that you all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend some time with them.
89	I'd like to get about 30 minutes with Mark, just to catch up.
90	ditto -- nice work Rob.
90	Your insights on project stanley are also much appreciated.
91	Please revise the document as Aleck's changes indicate.
91	With respect to the alternative responses shown near the end of the document, leave both alternatives in.
92	See below.
92	this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps, because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west.
92	In addition, if you get questions from the analysts on "reregulation" or price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services .
92	.
92	.
92	even a $250 price cap is 5-10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying.
93	See below.
93	This would have presented a bigger problem than price caps.
94	Tim -- Cindy manages this program.
94	Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on this.
94	Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief organizations like Catholic Relief Services?
94	I think that if we want to consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than the e-speak forum -- the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?
94	This could become controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism).
95	I think this is a good idea.
95	We may want to think about CNBC as well.
95	Brandon -- any technical obstacles?
95	Margaret/Cindy -- how does the link work?
95	does it go straight to the clip or do users have to navigate within CNN's site?
96	Are you aware of this?

98	Congratulations!
99	I won't be going.
99	Let's look for an alternate.

107	Let's ask Jeff Hines(?), our opinion research guy, to put a few short questions together and send it out.
107	We may also want to include a link so people can view the commercials again before answering.
107	Also, I was talking with Beth Tilney today about our website (and the fact that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing).
107	We thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference (perhaps as part of an existing segment).
108	Interesting idea, but hard to see any near term benefit.
108	I would decline.
109	Please forward to Sue Walden and get her ideas.

111	Also, I would like you to set up a meeting with me, Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney, Kelly Kimberly, Mark koenig, Rick Causey, and Rick Buy.
111	I was thinking the easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 6 or 6:30 some evening.
111	I have contacted Beth and Cindy already, so they know what it is about, and I will leave messages for the others.
111	I just need to check schedules for now.
111	Also, I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once a month or so for the Public Affairs organization.
111	Nothing fancy .

111	Cadillac Bar or something similar.

111	spouses and significant others invited.
111	Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know what you come up with.
112	I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever.
112	Having duties related to setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on the Hill, will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those duties, not just those related specifically to her substantive area.
112	I think it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting, rather than directing, others in the organization.

114	Hey -- you're talking about our future President!
114	I am soooo looking forward to my next Biennial Resource Planning proceeding.
115	Tim I enjoyed meeting with you too.
115	As I mentioned, I thought your answers were thoughtful, well stated, and accurate.
115	In our line of work it helps to triangulate using others' insights and I found yours particularly useful.
116	I would like your insights.
116	Meredith, I'd like yours as well (particularly in light of the messageyou received from Lawson and Jefferson).

117	calendar -- FYI
118	Start with Joe hillings in DC
119	FYI
120	No, contact Rosalee Fleming (ken's assistant).
120	I let her know that you would be preparing the briefing.
121	I am interested, but it's probably more important that Jeff Dasovich and Sandi Mccubbin (in our SF office) know, so that they can keep the politicos informed (and keep them from doing something stupid).
121	Thanks Enron Energy Services
122	Tony Pryor (GPG legal) asked if we have any credentials/tickets left for die hard democrats in the company.
122	I know Tony will understand if they are already spoken for, but if we have some left that would go unused, we have a volunteer.
122	How's it going?
122	Are you partied out yet?
123	Jeff Shankman (COO of Enron Global Markets) is interested in going and would like to see the schedule.
123	I told him you would send it to him.
123	Jeff can also help us get our message across on the problems in California's power markets (Dasovich can fill you in).
123	Also John ( Woody) Wodraska, managing director of Azurix is interested in attending.
123	Please get in touch with him.
123	I haven't heard from Stan yet.
124	What about the "show cause" order route?
125	Palmisano left a couple of months ago to start his own business.
125	Jeff Keeler (in our DC office) is covering John's issues.
126	Also, you should contact Ken's assistant, Rosalee Fleming, to see when would be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs.
126	I have told Rosalee that you are preparing the materials for Ken.
127	I can hardly believe Peggy Noonan wrote this.
127	I'm a sucker for blatant heart string pulling.
127	I love it.
127	I'm misty.
128	Did you see Peggy Noonan's article?
128	Shapiro and I are getting misty eyed.
129	FYI
130	As we discussed.
131	Please detach the attachment, combine it with the articles Gavin Dillingham sent me and attach to an e-mail to Robert Zoellick and Irwin Stelzer with this message from me: Attached is some background information on the "reregulation" crisis in California.
132	I'm afraid we have our work cut out for us.
132	We have been working the proces at the state and federal level in the past couple of weeks.
132	I continue to believe (hope)
133	Oops.
133	My computer sent the message before I was finished.
133	I continue to hope that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.
133	Price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management.
133	I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out of it.
133	More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions.
133	On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level.
133	Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ...
133	Linda Breathitt.
133	Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.
133	We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country.
133	THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.
133	In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).
133	I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.
133	Hang in there.
134	The plan was to hit the issue twice -- once in the short format of Ebiz and at greater length in the longer format of the October issue of Enron Business.
134	Please let Paul know.
135	Please go ahead with preparation of the talking points.
135	I'll give Ken a heads up.
136	Background information.
136	I'd like to talk to Ken about making the call.
136	.
136	.
136	I'll see him at Exec comm today.
137	We'll have the usual macroeconomic update from Larry Lindsay and Gavyn Davies, the domestic political update from Bill Kristol and some presentations from Gary Hamel and others focussing on Enron NetWorks.
138	for meeting file
139	See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.
139	The message is: there has not been enough deregulation; the government is still very much in the way.
139	California is a perfect example: the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage.
140	Have you solicited comments fromo EES?
141	I believe we should back Massey as well.
141	Who do we weigh in with now?
142	Probably not.
142	Let's communicate Breathitt's interest to Bone and stay out of it for now.
143	Thanks for the note and congratulations.
143	Sorry we didn't get a chance to talk before you left.
143	But, I'm still here; give me a call when you get a
144	I've made some changes (shown in bold).
144	Bracketed text indicates a deletion
145	In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at Enron.
145	Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).
145	This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.
145	We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.
145	I suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization
146	My message cut off...
146	The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems ..
146	.
146	solutions which have become available only recently.
146	Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization.
146	I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.
146	I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.
146	I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron.
147	Yes.
147	Contact either Gia or John and get the ball rolling.
147	Thanks
148	Should we (or ESCA) start looking for opportunities like this now to get the word out?
149	Please forward to public affairs group.
150	We handed the Oped to DeLay's staff at lunch.
150	I think we're finished for now.
151	Any interest?
152	Not yet.
152	May not be until sept 5 as ken is on vacation.
152	but there is a chance that ken will try to reach him in the meantime.
152	I'll let you know when I hear.
153	thanks for your help in preparing for the Texas hearing.
153	I think Texas legislators are viewing the California experience in the proper context and I think I was at least marginally articulate on the emissions issues as well.
153	thanks again.
154	the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I don't think we need the DC grass tops component.
154	we have an effective set of messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.
154	Perhaps we could use Charlie as a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson, I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however, (and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly).
155	Eric - I think the release looks fine.
155	Shelley -- I take it there are no affiliate issues here (or they have been fully vetted)?
156	this is fantastic!!
157	Is this someone in the analyst/associate program?
158	You probably saw the announcement that Mike Mcconnell is now CEO of Enron Global Markets.
158	EGM will be focussing on a number of new and existing markets (including coal, LNG, crude and products, interest rates, agricultural commodities, equities, weather, etc).
158	One of the markets Mike's group is actively considering is transport capacity.
158	I mentioned your work in the area.
158	He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a chance to review it.
159	In case you had not heard, Lou Pai has done some fundraising for Franks and both he and his(Lou's) sister know him fairly well.
159	Keep it in mind if at some point we need to get in to see him.
160	I think the Qs and As look good.
160	I wouldn't bring up the California situation (eliminate the second half of A25).
161	I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would be better if not sent at all.
161	It doesn't address the real underlying problem -- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.
161	Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for action next year.
161	If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go out at all.
162	Have we suggested to FERC staff that they force the ISO and PX to open the "blackbox" to show how they determine dispatch?
162	In addtion, if you are not on the distribution list for Belden's memo on utility behavior in California this summer, I will forward it to you.
162	It suggests some other areas FERC ought to be looking into.
163	Looks like you got this earlier.
163	I think it has new relevance in light of FERC's announced investigation.
164	It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.
164	We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.
164	San Diego has offers in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them.
164	This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers.
164	Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.
164	Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages.
164	Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.
165	In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.
165	I think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).
165	That's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).
165	I am also concerned that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees.
166	We don't have revised versions yet.
166	when we do, we will probably only want to put some (not all) of the documents on the intranet.
167	I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future).
167	Can we make that argument work?

169	Rosie -- please check Ken's calendar.
169	This would be a great one to do if we can squeeze it in. Nick -- congrats on what looks like a great new opportunity to make progress.

173	Looks ok
174	One more -- Nick O'Day in Tokyo
175	Congratulations!
176	I'm putting in for Chairman and CEO of rationalizations and euphemisms.
177	Neither Ken nor Jeff are available.
177	It would probably be better for one of you to speak anyway.
177	Any interest?
178	I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.
178	Do we pass or is there an alternative?
178	Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week?
179	I may be adding someone to the agenda -- Vikram Pandit (recommended by Ken Lay and Pug Winokar)
180	How are we handling these now?
180	Last time I talked to Jeff, we weren't going to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the restrictions).
180	Any word?
181	More info.
182	I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your questions: both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to Rick Shapiro.
182	From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and Asia).
182	Both Rick and Mark report to me.
182	Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder).
182	Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time).
183	Could you work with Allison to get the needed information to cathy.
184	A bit lengthy, but I think it looks fine.
185	This is the e-mail I was talking about.
186	I do support the change.
186	Let me know what I can do to help.
186	You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, particularly the US.
186	What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is: gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.
186	Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation).
186	Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue.
186	It seems to work: outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues.
187	Please send the economist piece around.
188	No, I had the right date from our previous communications.
189	When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.
189	We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.
189	Is this true?
189	Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control "path 15"?
189	Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?
189	Are there other examples and are there links between these "preferences" and the current problems in California?
189	As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

191	what does the siting bill provide for?
192	Skilling will be speaking at the National Press Club next week.
192	He'll give an overview of Enron's business, talk about what's going on in power markets, and what should be done to fix the current problems.
192	California will get covered as well.
192	Other than what we have already discussed, is there anything Jeff should know or address in his remarks?
193	Look at this.
193	Baum finally speaks up -- way too late.
193	Can somebody tell me what SDG&E's energy rate was pre-dereg?
194	They refer to expedited siting.
194	What are the provisions?
195	Yes, thanks.
195	Lay is going to be giving the keynote.
195	It may be a hard story to assemble: the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets, yet we still have high prices.
195	It's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on OPEC.
195	I'm interested in any views you may have.
196	Got your message.
196	I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC.
196	I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.
196	He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling.
196	Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.
196	But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.
196	Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions. One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose. Those who did are doing fine.
197	Thaniks for the note.
197	Christie is now organizing our university relationships, so direct the communication to her.

204	attached is a copy of my california testimony.
204	The proceeding was somewhat productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points.
204	Our view on this is: the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed).
204	What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now: Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now.
204	Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act.
204	Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.
205	Attached is my testimony.
206	Cynthia, get back to Jeff on this.
206	It doesn't look like a high priority to me, but I will absolutely defer to your judgment.
207	Jeff - Chris is on point on this issue.
207	He and Dan Reck have already spoken.
208	I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the process works in practice.
208	A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should remain purely relative.
209	I talked with Scott Tholan and he immediately understood your concerns.
209	I don't think there is anything else you need to do right now.
209	Let me know, though, if there are requests for information you consider inappropriate.
210	I'm still waiting for Davis' office to call.
210	The plan currently is for me to talk to him when and if he calls.
210	Sandi has been in touch with the governor's office.
210	By the way, thanks for the summary of the California proceedings.
210	I talked to Hebert yesterday and he was duly impressed with your remarks ...

214	I am sending Vince some materials we have used
215	Please forward to Advisory Committee

218	I talked to Hettie today.
218	It's unlikely that we are going to find time for Jeff and the Governor to talk (because of the Governor's schedule).
218	We'll try to set something up later.
218	In the meantime, the Governor should just sign the bill.
218	Of course, Hettie had already communicated this; the Gov's office acknowledged that the message was recieved but did not make a specific commitment.
219	Any interest?
220	Decline.
221	I think it looks fine; will defer to Jeff's edits.
222	Thanks.

223	He focusses on oil primarily but also does a nice job of framing the importance of sound energy policy to our continued economic growth.

224	It shows Bush with only a 6 point lead among oil and gas industry executives and analysts.
225	Joe - could you or someone in the office get in touch with Michelle?
225	Thanks
226	I understand from Shelley that you are going to be seeing Commissioner Breathitt on Monday.
226	We have been working to persuade her to vote for forceful FERC action on electricity issues.
226	She is widely viewed as the swing vote (with Massey and Hoecker being the other two votes) needed for the Commission to take action.
226	Attached are two documents -- one is a set of talking points for you and the second is a FERC action plan that we are floating with several of the Commissioners.
227	fyi - there has been some concern that this deal was being put together without Connecticut authorities knowing the full extent of our interest in

229	You should plan to be there.
230	I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.
230	For example, how much of the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?
230	He wants to make the point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.
231	great news!
231	Keep up the good work.

232	any interest?
233	Joe - there is no announcement today.
233	I tried to leave you a voicemail but apparently the system is down there.
233	Before we can offer an outside person a VP position, the Executive Committee must sign off.
233	We are going to be going through that process in a few minutes.
233	Then we begin the offer extension and negotiations.
233	The person we are recommending is Linda Robertson, one of the two people I mentioned to you before.
233	Please guard the information carefully.
233	Last time we talked, when the list had been narrowed to two, DeLay's office called with the exact two names and started pushing us to hire a Republican.
233	As you know we interviewed candidates of both political affiliations and just settled on the best person.
233	Ken told DeLay's office that's how we do things and Ken is comfortable (actually enthused) about the choice.
233	When some external announcement is done, you will be involved and your considerable contributions will be prominently mentioned.
234	Looks good.
234	I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it more explicit: The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity infrastructure more than anything else.
234	The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
234	Let's start getting the word out!

241	Isn't our primary problem with AEP's internal merchant function rather than with the marketing affiliate (I realize we have problems with the affiliate too)?
241	Can we protest continued market based rate authority for AEP until they have surrendered native load priority?

243	The senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively, but it does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue.
244	Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover their shortfall.
244	In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.
245	Looks good.

245	Sarah The Honorable James Hoecker Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street, N.E.
245	Washington, D.C. Re: Electric Power Industry Reform Dear Chairman Hoecker: We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power.
245	We write to urgyou and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerableshortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in the electric power industry.
245	It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supplyof power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.
245	There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that the power supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonableprices.
245	For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in the nation,s electricity gird.
245	Under the current system, FERC regulations amany companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers.
245	The result of thispolicy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.
245	Like the interstathighway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to another just as freely as motorists do.
245	All electricity suppliers shouldhave the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to where it is most needed.
245	FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers, reliance on spot andshort-term electricity markets for power supply.
245	Instead, FERC should urgesuppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term contracts.
245	Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumersfrom unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.
245	We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on thesereforms.
245	Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more reliable and economical.
245	Very truly yours,
246	I don't know.
246	Can we get someone in IT to respond?
247	FYI
248	It's fine with me.
249	Please send regrets
250	See if there is anythiing of use in here for your high tech group messages.

254	Please pst and circulate to the team.
254	We probably need to open a new section on the site to adress gas prices.
255	Submit a Pac request and keep Tom posted on when and where.
256	I think I confirmed for this already, but could you check and put on my calendar and put this in the meeting file.
257	I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush.
257	I think the electricity section needs some additions though.
257	There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.
257	Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.
257	Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid.
257	The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed.
257	This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen.
257	The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.

261	I would like to do this, but I have a speaking engagement the next day -- do the time zones work out so that I can do both or do I need to find a sub for the nov 1 speech?
262	Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and pricing problems in the California market.
262	In summary, the proposal would have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.
262	The gov asked if anyone had successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.
262	I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or North American) by mid day Monday.
262	Jeff and I will have a follow up call with the governor on Monday.
262	Thanks
263	For the call with Davis this am.....
264	let's bring him in
265	Per our discussion
266	See first item below
267	Just a "heads up" ...
267	Ken may get a call from Gov Gilmore regarding the Republican Governors' Association.
267	Below are Sue Landwehr's recommendations (with which I concur).
267	Let me know if he calls and let us know if you need any additional information.
268	I share your perceptions of Jose, though I don't have as much contact as you do.
268	I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's work.
268	I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.
269	FYI
270	Mark has some editorial changes to the letter if there is still time
271	What do you think?
271	If you think this would be useful, go ahead and order it.
272	What have they done for us?
273	I won't be on the call, but will fax my comments to you this am
274	I've got a few too many speeches coming up.
274	You are probably in the best position to address this crowd (time for the student to teach the teacher), but I'd understand if you think it would be awkward (the we should just decline).
275	Do you guys follow these reports?
275	Do we need to correct them?
276	When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management conference had not yet been scheduled.
276	Now it has and, of course, it conflicts...
276	it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at Enron.
276	I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on a couple of candidates: how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott Magrane(sp?).
276	The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, was working on Transcos.
276	Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA so I can take care of the problem.
276	Thanks
277	I mentioned the need to call Gramm in the exec committee meeting today and Ken is willing to do it.
277	The talking points ISDA sent looked fairly generic.
277	Given Ken's relationship, and the fact that he has talked to Gramm previously on the subject, what should we ask Ken to cover?
277	I'd like to give him a background document and talking points like we did last time.
277	I will send it by fax to you Chris and would appreciate it if you could update it as appropriate.
278	Do you still expect Guinn to call Ken?

286	Nick Lampson called and asked for a contribution.
286	I committed to one without knowing about his vote on PNTR.
286	I will keep my word by making an individual contribution but will also communicate to him that in my capacity as Enron PAC chair i cannot authorize the PAC to make a contribution as a result of that vote.
286	Sorry I jumped the gun.
287	What do you think he'll add?
288	looks good
289	I assume we avoid Libya completely.
289	The question, though, may be how we proceed if we are doing business with someone who has activities in Libya.

290	I may need to spend some time with you in advance, but you don't have to plan on coming here.
291	I think the presentation looks good.
291	In the meeting itself I think you should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for Sempra shareholders to be in a commodity market as a regulated entity -- the "heads they win tails you lose" argument.

306	This could become a very deep pit.
306	I don't want to distract you from theprimary mission, but there may be a solution which gets them what they needand doesn't pull you away from the North American effort -- you could "deputize" Jane Wilson to help out on this.
306	Jane, as usual, has embeddedherself deeply in the Enron India organization as VP of Gov't Affairs and can be a sound source of information for you as well as an agent for you in India.
306	Think about contacting her and getting her help.
306	Also, we have never explicitly talked about whether your focus is North American or world wide.
306	My view is that it is worldwide, but that has to bheavily modified by the fact that most Enron employees (current and probablfuture) are here; while the US has many deficiencies in its education systegraduate education here is the best in the world; and we need to show rapidearly success (and that's best accomplished by sticking close to home at least initially).
306	cc: Subject: Re: ENRON UNIVERSITY AFFAIRS Mark, Steve, I'd be happy to get us involved with this, but I'm not sure how we're handling non-North American University affairs.
306	Please let me know and I'll follow up with Rajesh.
306	Thanks!

307	If you can cover it I would say yes.
307	It's a key race and we have been close to Ashcroft for years.
307	Let's make sure he knows we gave it....
307	we need to follow up with him.
307	Last time I talked to him he basically recited the utilities' position on electric restructuring.
307	Let's make it clear that we want to talk right after the election.
308	How did this happen?
309	I realize the group may go a different way with this, but I remain convinced that we should go to a pure number system (ie a pure relative ranking) and use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people.
309	Just adding the qualifier "relative to peers" glosses over what's really going on.
309	The behavior and skill descriptors tell everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion.
309	The relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or "looser" on performance rankings, terminations, and comp.
310	One of the things you should include in your report to Koenig and Frevert is our preliminary views on the RTO filings.
310	Perhaps it's simply that we are not going to be satisfied until FERC forces nondiscriminatory access and we will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming.
311	calendar and meeting file
312	please check schedule and get back to Irwin's office.
313	Washington would be fine ....
313	there's always plenty to do there.
313	I got a note from Ken asking that you and I have the first meeting and come back to him withrecommendations.
313	I agree with the agenda you have set out.
313	It may also be worth discussing how we can use the individual members of this group outside of the meetings with the Enron Exec Committee: there may be efforts elsewhere in the company which would benefit from the advice and input of members of the group.
314	Thanks for the resume.
314	I don't see a fit in government affairs, but I am forwarding to community relations to see if there is any interest there.
315	Thanks for the update.
315	I want to make sure we present the numbers in a morcoherent fashion than just laying out the individual RCs.
315	You and I havediscussed this before; my recollection is that we were going to break out afollows: Administrative services Aviation building services new building ongoing government affairs Americas Other budgets retained at business unit level (explanation of shift in expenses from advocacy to transaction support/riskmanagement Brand advertising internal comm other PR I may be forgetting some of the subgroups we talked about, but this is thegeneral idea. Elizabeth Linnell Sent by: Elizabeth Linnell cc: Subject: meeting with Mark Lindsay I wanted to update you on my conversation this morning with Mark Lindsay regarding next week,s budget meeting. The format will be similar to last year,s. We,ll be receiving from Mgroup a consolidated spreadsheet of all of our budgets, grouping them by functionality and illustrating 2000 plan, 2000 estimate, and 2001 plan, andthe variances between. We will be covering the EPSC and Aviation budgetsduring the same meeting. Billie and I will get together on Friday to compare what the two of us have so far, and then we have a meeting set up for Mondamorning with you, Bill, Billie and me to go over everything in advance ofTuesday,s meeting. Points that Mark made (no surprises here): - Jeff has mentioned that he wants to see reductions in all corporate costcenters since our international activities look like they,re going away. (We have made significant reductions year to year on our international gov,taffairs and PR budgets, and I think we can justify that the other cost centers are primarily focused on domestic activities while the individualbusiness units budget much of those activities themselves.) - Even though we,re allocating more overall to the business units this year, Jeff will be interested in the gross budget numbers, before any allocations- We need to be able to explain any significant budget changes year to yea - Mark particularly emphasized the increase in the PR budget, most of whiis retained at Corp anyway - We need to be able to explain anything that we,ve inherited from thebusiness units that is now staying at Corp. This applies to the headcountthat we,ve picked up from ENA and from Int,l (Dennis, group). Lindsay mentioned that there,s a possibility that Causey may, in advance of our Tuesday meeting, meet by himself with Skilling to get a general idea ofwhere Jeff stands on the corporate budgets as they,ve been submitted so far, and then come back to us with instructions on any changes that need to bemade. If this is the case, we may have to make cuts before we get to preseour case. I'm working on our presentation based on that conversation and will forwardit to you as it progresses.

318	I talked to Ken Lay and he will support Carol as VP.
318	I have talked to Carol and she knows the process.
318	We are going to take her up at the next Excom meeting.
318	I don't think there is anything you need to do right now.
319	Look at the last article ....
319	any idea what the "rude awakening" might be?
320	See Dow Jones newswire story at the end
321	Please see attached.
322	Can we be even stronger on this?
322	The short answer is that Joe's resignatiohas no impact on our view toward India.
322	The evaluation of our asset holdinand new business opportunities is the same the day after Joe's resignation as it was the day before.
322	If need be, we can reiterate previous statements about our ongoing review of asset positions.
322	What do you think?
322	Mark Metts@Enron, Paula Rieker@ENRON cc: Mark Palmer@ENRON, Karen Denne@ENRON, Cindy Derecskey@ECT Subject: Sutton India Statement We expect considerable Indian media interest and attempts to interpret theimplications of Joe Sutton's resignation.
322	In consultation with Mark Palmerand others, we have developed the following statement, which we intend to uonly in response to media inquiries.
322	Please let me know if you have any comments.
322	John For Enron Use ) Only if Asked Statement on Impact of Sutton Resignation on Enron in India Joe Sutton,s departure should not significantly affect Enron,s commitment to the Indian market.
322	In fact, consistent with Enron,s new business lines, we are in the process of developing data centers and a fiber optic network inIndia.
322	Of course, we continuously look to optimize the value of our busineinterests and there may be some related adjustments in our holdings, but weexpect to continue as a significant participant in the Indian market.
322	If pressed: We are not able to comment on specific plans or operations, as it is our policy not to comment on the details of potential divestitures or acquisitions.
323	Thanks, Nick.
323	I am anxious to get out there soon.
323	In the meantime I'll send a tape of my singing voice.
324	I would drop the second sentence (it's a bit convoluted).
324	I would also like to look at what else the ad says -- ie how are the quotes introduced, what other quotes will be used, etc.
325	Please get the list of people I interviewed (and their resumes) from Allison Bailey and confirm with her that if the attached spreadsheet shows a "y" next to their name that means they received an offer (if "n" then no offer).

327	The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC commissioners.
327	Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.
327	We plan to talk to the press about it as well.
327	A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.
327	Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.
327	While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.
327	It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.
327	On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.
327	This is just our best guess at this point.
327	the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday.
328	My mistake, but no reason to stop the presses.
329	thanks.
329	the letter is already out, but we will be accurate in follow up calls and in press interviews.
330	Any interest?
331	Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of what FERC did today.
331	One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.
331	The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.
331	So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.
332	I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.
332	I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.
332	I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure number system.
332	We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.
332	You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations.
332	I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly.
332	I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior).
332	I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously.
332	I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot.
332	I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues ....
332	very vice presidential of him...
332	no overstepping of bounds ...
332	quite the contrary.
333	I am out of town.
333	Joe - can you attend?
334	Please ask Ken to sign the following.
334	But, in the Advisory Council letter delete the reference to the December Board meeting and check with Ken on whether he still plans to brief the Enron Board at the December meeting (I believe he talked to Kelly Kimberly about this).
335	I think it looks good.
335	a few suggestions though: I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the road).
335	We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.
335	I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along. We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize utilities for underscheduling" not predicting. Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do. (Also, my title is just EVP and Chief of Staff)
336	Did Ken ask us to sponsor it or just consider it?
336	I'm wondering what if anything we gain from such an investment, but I have an open mind on it.
337	My only comment relates to the Azurix reference ...
337	it's not a significant part of the biz and things have changed recently.
337	i don't think it merits reference.
338	John -- I'm copying Janine and Barb on this message as they are most likely to be able to identify someone.
338	Janine and Barb -- could one of you get in touch with John?
339	congratulations on a great launch!
339	The US press on the office opening has been great.
339	If you haven't seen it, get in touch with Ann Schmidt.
340	I believe the registration deadline for the Nov 7 election has passed.
340	I'll ask Eliz to forward the registration materials to you so you can be ready for the next election.
340	Also, if you were registered in Harris County before you may still be on the rolls at your old precinct ...
340	you should ask.
341	I don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here, but I have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about reaching agreement on our two key issues.
341	Can we put the question differently: what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do together to address those barriers?
341	If the barriers for EEI are insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?
342	I am very interested in pursuing this and I believe Enron presents an ideal case study for the purposes you outlined.
342	I am copying Christie Patrick on this message and asking her to coordinate this for us.
342	Christie has worked on other case studies and will be very helpful in navigating Enron for you.
343	Let's add Rick, Jim and me
344	Thanks, Barb.
345	see resume attached
346	Attached are a revised org chart and a revised org memo.
346	Work form these drafts to incororate the handwritten changes I have given you.
347	I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.
347	The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.
347	I need your help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.
347	Please help with the following information: Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we have under way (or planned).
347	I'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have.
347	Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
347	Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?
347	If so, it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved.
347	Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
347	ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).
347	I have the ISO market surveillance report.
347	Is there another ISO report?
347	If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too.
347	CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less than 10%)?
347	Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of the cap is not sufficient.
347	Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
347	Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility (and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
347	Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich): We are asking FERC to be courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.
347	To be even halfway credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the price cap issue..
347	We have never been closer to reform in California, we need these guys on board.
347	Thanks.
348	Attached is the presentation I used for a very general update on deregulation; it includes some California material.
349	Looks good
350	Ricardo -- Mark's organization is on point on this one.
351	Dave Delaney has asked that we accelerate our look at space alternatives in Mexico City.
351	If you assume that you and Jaime and (perhaps) one person from EBS remain there, what do you think the cost is (or when can you let me know)?
352	FYI - we had a bomb threat this am.
353	It's a hoax..
353	This e-mail made it into a reporter's hands and the reporter asked about this in the Clinton-Lazio debates in NY.
353	CNN covered the hoax the next day.
353	The US Postal Service denied it, of course.
353	By the way, I have never seen a letter -- "P" -- following a bill number in the Congressional numbering system.

363	Wendy Gramm (an Enron Board member) referred Jay Valesquez(sp?) to Jeff Skilling about an event in Dallas for Senator Lugar.
363	The event is Sunday November 19 and Jeff is out of town.
363	Would you please give Jay a call and decide what we should do?
363	Jay's number is 202-973-5980
364	Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail while she is out.
364	Further, I was only copying her on messages that many others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).
364	But, if this is a standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in California, I think it leaves a bad impression.
364	Can we find a way to direct urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external lobby team?
365	Per my voicemail, attached is a proposed "statement" to open the Executive Committee meeting on Monday.
366	Eliz -- does this allocation reflect the cuts we have already made?
367	Don't worry about it ...
367	sorry for putting you back on speaker.
367	I just wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).
367	Thanks for the comment on the hearing.
367	In some respects I don't think the first panel could have gone much better; everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for different reasons).
367	The other staff reports are also looking good.
367	Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.
368	Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a public hanging?
368	I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach.
369	See below.
369	Can we get some help on the IBM issues?
370	calendar
371	There are a few other issues we need to look into: Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO -- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.
371	He asked if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I suspect it's already too late for that).
371	My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this "exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it through.
371	Is EOL or APX an alternative?
371	Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.
371	Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development?"
371	In addition to any other points we might make, I think we should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder forward market development.
371	Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward.
371	We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.
371	We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take the approach I took in my testimony: FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible).
371	Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.
371	Analogy: if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends).
371	So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized.
371	Those functions should be left to the market.
372	per voicemail
373	per our discussion.
373	Want to schedule a tour and want to make sure that Marchris is avail (let Rick and Montovano know)
374	What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.
374	We have debated from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity).
374	Where do we stand?
375	congratulations!
375	One thing to add to the arguments: we have to make the adverse effect on consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.
375	We need the legal arguments too, but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion.
375	We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted.
375	California has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.
375	That's not good for consumers.
375	If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.
375	Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral presentations.
375	Do you agree?
376	Thanks for the message.
376	I agree that once we have a good outline of what we are going to do we are going to need someone who can get it done.
376	I think you would be an outstanding candidate for that role (seems to me we went after you once before).
376	Is your inquiry confidential or can I discuss it with others?
377	Thanks, I enjoyed it too and would be happy to do it again.
378	If we are interested in doing this, the interviewee should probably be from EEL
379	Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said -- ie the soft cap only applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including bilateral fwd contracts?
380	You might try Scott Tholan, Mike Hicks, or Rick Buy.
381	As I mentioned at the executive committee meeting, we have a number of people who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.
381	We believe that a call from you to Cheney may be required.
381	David Haug.
381	David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team.
381	Woody Wodraska.
381	Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and Florida.
381	He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.
381	Amanda is aware of his interest and is amenable to his service.
381	James Steffes.
381	You know Jim.
381	He is one of the most creative and talented people in my organization.
381	He is familiar with state and federal energy regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an active role in deregulation efforts.
381	He would be great to have on a vetting team for commission nominees.
381	I have talked to Jim and he is interested.
381	Others.
381	We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market regulation.
381	The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they would like to have.
381	Among them: Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a republican who works for us in the upper midwest.
381	Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the "vetting" team as possible.
381	Let me know how I need to proceed.
382	can you find the contact and see if they are still interested in the money?
383	That flight time is fine.
383	A couple of other things: I need to meet with McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.
383	Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' office.
383	Also, my return should be first thing Tuesday morning (I think we had discussed Monday night originally).
383	Just get me on the first available flight to Roswell.
383	Also, I didn't mean to put you in a difficult spot with Melissa.
383	I had tried getting hold of her last night but only got the answering machine.
383	Don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule.
383	If I haven't told her first, I'll deal with the consequences (I've logged "couch time" before plus I'm usually pretty good about keeping her up to date).
383	Thanks
384	I think this is something we should consider.
384	I'm asking Rob to look into it.
385	Thanks
386	I sent an electronic copy to John Baker.
386	Maureen could you send one directly to Jason and schedule lunch?
386	thanks
387	Contact Steve Walton To: Skean@enron.com (Steve Kean) cc: Subject: Outline for Project on Real-Time Markets Dear Steve, Once again, I call on you for advice.
387	Who, within Enron, should I talk withabout a new project I am working on, related to real-time balancing operations and markets (all the messy stuff that causes so many problems within all the existing ISOs)?
387	Here is the outline for the project.
387	Can you send me your suggestions on revising the outline, other people at Enron (and elsewhere) to contact related to these markets, and written materials on how the various ISO markets operate.
387	Thanks.
387	Eric ISSUES TO DISCUSS FOR PROJECT ON: REAL-TIME BALANCING OPERATIONS AND MARKETS 1.
387	Introduction: Importance of real-time operations and markets Essential for reliability, especially security Basis for all forward contracts (hour- and day-ahead, block monthlies, Real-time prices motivate generation-capacity decisions: new construction,repowering, retirements Ensure equitable treatment for &new8 intermittent and distributed res2. Physical Requirements and Operations Balance generation to load in near-real time (intrahour) Normal conditions (frequency response, CPS1, CPS2) Contingency conditions (DCS) In neither case is it necessary for generation to exactly balance load overshort time periods (e.g., 10 minutes), but must balance energy over longerintervals Benefits of aggregation Performance and characteristics of individual generation and load resourcesrandom fluctuations, energy level, ramp rate, acceleration rate, startup time, minimum run time, block loading, energy-limited characteristics of hydro units, etc Control-area balance vs individual-schedule balance, good vs bad inadverteninterchange NERC and FERC requirements 3.

RTO Operations and Markets Generation not owned by RTO, RTO must purchase outputs from generation andload resources Relationship between real-time operations and markets, how are resources dispatched (and by whom) and how are they compensated Time interval (1, 5, 10, or 15 minutes) for dispatch and price setting; whaare the tradeoffs in choosing among these intervals Single market-clearing price in each interval vs pay-as-bid for each resourPay for energy only or pay also for maneuverability (e.g., ramp and acceleration rates); how do resource constraints determine which resourcesare permitted to set the market-clearing price and which aren't, and why?Set prices ex ante or ex post? If prices set ex ante, what is the basis forthe value? Should unit commitment (resource scheduling) be done by individual supplierby RTO, or both? Relationship between real-time markets and ICAP and RMR requirements, and RTO requirements to ICAP and RMR units to bid resources into real-time marketTreatment of exports and imports, rules governing interchange scheduling (number of schedule changes per hour permitted, ramp rates for schedule changes) To what extent does the RTO make short-term forecasts of load and generatiohow far into the future (10 minutes to 24 hours), how does the RTO use thesforecasts? Should the RTO commit and dispatch resources on the basis of expected future conditions (i.e., beyond the current and next interval)? Whpays for these RTO decisions? Should RTO publish prices and let demand and supply respond to the price signal, or should RTO dispatch resources up and down based on supplier bidsIf the RTO explicitly dispatches resources, should uninstructed deviations be treated differently, in terms of payment or penalties, from instructed deviations? What about a resource,s failure to follow instructions? Under what circumstances should RTO go &out-of-market8 for resources? What should set the price of (payment to) these resources? Under what conditions, if any, are penalties appropriate, for what kinds ofbehavior, what determines the magnitude of the penalty? Should penalties apply to generation only or to loads also? How, if at all, should capacity assigned to ancillary services (especiallythe reserve services) be incorporated into real-time operations and marketsFor example, should the capacity assigned to contingency reserves be set aside and used only when a major outage occurs? Or should such reserves beused routinely whenever it is economic to do so, as long as sufficient capacity is available to meet the NERC reserve requirements? How should intermittent resources (e.g., wind) be treated in real-time operations and markets? Should they be treated any differently from a largevolatile load? Can retail loads participate in real-time markets? How? 5. Case Studies of U.S. ISOs California PJM, New York, and New England 6. Conclusions and Recommendations Key features of operations and markets What works What are the options What problems still remain Eric Hirst Consulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring 106 Capital Circle Oak Ridge, TN 37830
388	Another key point: to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.
388	In California peak demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.
388	The market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.
388	Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.
388	The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work.
388	Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work.
388	Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and Enron) did just fine during the summer.
388	Deregulation worked; the problems in California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market.
389	It looks like a good letter....
389	heavy on explanation of our position.
389	At some point I'd like to hear more of the background that's leading us to this position.
390	You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to $100,000.
390	I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why.
390	I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.
390	Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.
390	My reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.
390	Electric restructuring was a key example of this.
390	There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a "process".
390	Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.
390	The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).
390	Afterwards, the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not exclusively the Chamber's fault).
390	Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.
390	For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a veto right.
390	The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and things we will add our separate voice to in any event).
390	As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents.
390	Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us.
390	They represent the status quo in the business community.
390	Tom is an extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.
390	A voice which stands for moving business to the next level, not just protecting its current position.
390	Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) has been useful to us in the past.
390	In previous years, Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.
390	As a consequence, I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access to their international activities.
390	I suggested something in the $25,000 range.
390	That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our current dues to $100,000).
390	Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson.
390	I am interested in your insights, or, if you prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.
391	calendar/mtg folder
392	Thanks, I have what i need.
392	I'm working on a project with McKinsey regarding the accleration of new businesses, so I wanted to look at some examples of employee-driven business creation.
393	Maureen please check my calendar
394	I have not heard
395	Thanks, I also need to get some time with Shawn Cumberland...
395	please schedule that too.
396	Great work.
396	Any indication that the publication of the Stanley investigation is having any adverse effect?
397	meeting file
398	I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.
398	As you can see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).
398	The main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December Board meeting.
398	I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent.
398	A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization.
398	It also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.
398	My question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.
398	My suspicion is that our turnover is farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization.
398	Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors (ie we're OK at the top livels already).
398	Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?
398	We may need to weed out the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons) if possible.
399	I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the presentation.
399	I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.
399	Some of the points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in addition to outlining the changes.
399	Some of the themes which we should develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees on this e-mail).
399	These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.
399	I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with Jeff.
399	I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday.
400	Attached are my suggestions.
401	Proposed edits attached.
401	Looks good -- I like the references to the energy savings...
401	I think we should try to get this story some play in california; not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are working with in the Gov's office.
401	Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the final.
401	Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.
402	I have a reception that evening (coincidentally with another Rice group -- from the engineering school), so I will not be able to attend.
403	I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.
403	We are already doing a significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's (author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".
403	We have looked at numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target audience.
403	We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time.
403	I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline.
404	calendar and meeting file
405	Anything you want me to do?
406	huh?
407	I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to see the point of it.
407	Most people are not going to care about our industry's problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.
407	We should be telling them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc. What do you think?
408	what do you think
409	Looks good.
409	Is the co2 reduction only 10.5 tons or is it some multiple, like 10.5 thousand tons?
410	schedule
411	Please send an estimate of time and description of the topic to Rebecca.
412	Thanks.
412	Look at the attached ...
412	it may be too late for this afternoon, but I took a shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated issues (substitute for slides 15-17?)
413	please block off on my calendar
414	key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.
414	it's easier for me to remember those who are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.
414	it's also interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by his vision for a new approach to the energy business.
415	please get a copy and forward to paul kaufman's team.
416	see below.
416	I'm sure your guys are considering all of the applications in dcourse and those who are waiting are naturally going to be anxious to hear.Not asking for any special treatment for this individual, but, as we discussed in your office the other day, there are some continuing core skills in the EE&CC group that we need to hold onto.
416	At first glance, this guy seems to have those skills.
417	calendar
418	Shapiro is just unwilling to accept the fact that his guy is a very scary guy ...
418	enough to scare away lifelong democrats.
418	I got your voicemail.
418	Thanks for following up.
418	We would be looking for a contract relationship only, not full time.
419	can we get Gary's comments?
420	we'll try to get a copy of gary's comments
421	can we get a copy of gary's comments from cnbc?
422	I have been trying to hook up with Kevin and will see him tomorrow.
422	I still prefer to use the "old exec committee plus" for this PRC with a reformed MD PRC starting at mid year.
422	We have too many people in transition to just switch over to the policy committee at this stage.
423	Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to power and gas pricing, particularly in California.
423	Included are a detailed set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary designed for more general audiences and the media.
423	The gas paper was prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.
423	I will get a more integrated message put together and circulated.
424	I agree that we need to rework the copy, especially since the gas market is blowing up.
425	How are the appointments turning out from your perspective?
426	Attached is the accomplishment discussion to go with the public affairs goals -- let me know if this is sufficient and consistent with what you want to present....
426	I can provide more detail if needed.
427	In the first sentence could we say "transmission owning market participant".
428	here is the attachment
429	I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until we have legal (including FCPA) approval.
429	I have exchanged voicemails with Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.
429	If you have consulted local counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth.
429	Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later (as we have in other cases).
429	This issue has come up before in Europe.
429	The first time through is the hardest and slowest.
429	After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent requests move faster.
429	But we have to get it right.
429	Even in Europe, where our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in Europe -- even where other American companies don't).
430	Just got word from the lawyers: it's a go.
431	I need to talk to you about Wasaff's project when you get a chance ....
431	tomorrow, if possible,b ut not absolutely necessary.
431	Hope all is well.
432	Looks fine to me.
432	Dan, I assume you are comfortable with it.
433	LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out.
433	Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company: he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind (Dave left).
433	He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the company.
433	He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.
433	It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization.
433	He has been told that he needs to find something now.
433	Could you guys look into this?
433	Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, or find him something through the redeployment process?
434	calendar
435	No problem
436	I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.
436	I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.
436	I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.
436	I think that's probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses the ranges in the MD level.
437	Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the results and does the MD ranking.
437	Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make sure he has these too.
437	Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.
437	Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's PRC.
437	If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.
438	Can Rick attend.
438	need one other person too
439	I agree.
439	It doesn't appear that we have the need for his skills that we had even a few months ago.
439	I see that you are in contact with Michelle Hargrave about next steps.
439	Anything you want me to do at this point?
440	Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably already have this, Lisa).
440	This organization represents perhaps the biggest near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory fora, and perhaps new countries.
440	From time to time, I'm sure we will all be called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive.
441	It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call out" number from the charts ...
441	specifically,what happened to microsoft's turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?
442	It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.
442	The color scheme looks good.
443	Mo - please set up a call
444	Cindy -- it seems to me we should use an HR distribution to get this out.
444	Let Mike and I know what you think.
445	Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media.
445	Unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working ....
445	they are open and they are competitive.
445	On the other hand, retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets ...
445	they are not open, customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, so there is no demand response when prices rise.
445	On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.
445	Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?
446	calendar and respond
447	FYI....
447	Jane Wilson is our government affairs person in Mumbai.
448	calendar ...
448	also please RSVP for melissa and I to the Lay's party.
449	fine with me
450	I would very much like your help on this.
450	I agree that we should follow up on the others and if it doesn't work, then pursue some Bush people.
450	the evening before for Pres -elect Bush is a good idea too; can yu follow up?
451	Our recommendations on possible FERC Commissioners for Ken's next discussion with Cheney.
452	Question: why do we need from jan 8 to jan 31 to respond to staff comments?
452	I think we should squeeze that time dramatically to take a shot at Jan or early Feb resolution.
452	If there is slippage, I don't want our earliest target date to be the end of Feb.
453	calendar as fyi
454	Thanks for the idea.
454	I'll pass it on to Mark Metts
455	have we reponded?
456	I talked to Peggy and her messages seem to be the same as ours.
456	Call if you want to discuss.
457	Let me know what you think of the attached version.
458	See revised version attached and let me know what you think.
459	I like it.
459	Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of those efforts?
459	Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in California perhaps we should consider it.
460	As we discussed
461	The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.
461	Apparently, he was trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we were bumped.
461	We are trying to set a new time.
461	I will share with the Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you helped put together.
461	Thanks
462	This is very good work.
462	You make all the points we need to make without spraining anything in the process.
462	You have been doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances.
462	On another note: I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.
462	We are trying to get another time, perhaps as early as this week.
462	Davis did meet with Greenspan and Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively.
463	Rosie -- I'm not sure if this went through ...
463	I couldn't find it in my "sent file".
463	Karen -- attached are the documents I mentioned to you a minute ago.
464	We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.
464	In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.
464	The gov.
464	spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.
464	He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.
464	Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.
464	Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments: Overview: We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration.
464	The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.
464	His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.
464	He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.
464	He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).
464	He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
464	Our proposals: I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).
464	He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.
464	He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.
464	As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
464	His ideas: The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".
464	Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
464	State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.
464	The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.
464	This was a frequently recurring theme.
464	Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.
464	Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.
464	State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.
464	Expand in-state gas production.
464	Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
464	negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.
464	Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.
464	Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
464	Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).
464	Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.
464	We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.
464	Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
464	To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.
464	He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
464	He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.
464	He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.
464	Thanks to everyone for their help.
464	We made some progress today.
465	Forgot to include you on this.
466	Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very well.
466	Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.
466	She is very well respected in washington.
466	She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.
466	She has gotten up to speed very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's already paid for!!).
467	Scott sent this to Marty, but I assume you already have had communications with him about this.
468	OK to update
469	This guy has it right.
470	So is it bigger than his tax cut on an annual average basis?
471	Let's make sure that he gets our list of FERC Commissioner candidates (with special emphasis on Wood and Brownell).
472	Minor edits as shown.
472	Otherwise, looks good.
473	See revisions.
473	Am also attaching the "solutions document" we left with the Governor.
473	I think we should follow that basic format and include the solutions set out there.
474	See suggestions
475	I don't know if I have sent one of these to you before.
475	This is an e-mail update service that we may want to consider as a distribution vehicle -- either because they pick up the content or because we procure their distribution list.
475	Dan- could you have someone check these guys out?
476	My comments
477	These were the next to last drafts (before correcting any typos).
478	I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.
478	He is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience.
478	While I don't have a position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an open position.
478	My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.
478	I stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could build to it over time.
478	His main concern was that he not get "lost in the system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.
478	I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.
479	Call me about this

482	I don't think this will work.
482	We have offices on 50M but two are set aside for board members and one (the one Rob Walls recently left) is going to be tied up with a video crew working on the analyst meeting.
483	Joe and Linda, could you prepare our views on these two and forward to Ken?
484	What should i tell john?
485	Nathan, give me call if you can -- 713-853-1586.
485	I'm EVP and Chief of Staff for Enron.
485	We met during the on-campus interview process.
485	I know we have extended an offer and I'm still hoping you'll accept.
485	Call me.
486	I tinkered a bit more with the background doc.
487	recommendations
488	Accurate and sobering.
488	I've made two small comments just as an fyi.
489	Attached is a summary of the Jan 13 Davis-Summers summit on the California power situation.
489	We will be discussing this at the 2:00 call today.

502	Any interest?
503	I know Chip personally, as, of course, does Leslie.
503	Leslie may be better able to speak to Chip's judicial background.
503	Chip is a fine man and deeply involved in his community.
503	Any chance we could pass word on to Sen. Dom.'s office?
504	You need to be aware that we are in the process of selling the Wind Co. Mark Metts and Amit Walya are working on this.
504	If the price changes under the QF contracts it would impact the sale.
504	Call Amit to discuss (345-5570).
505	schedule and file.
505	I will be presenting at this meeting.
506	Please send comments to Elizabeth ASAP.
507	schedule and meeting file
508	I think there is merit in pursuing this.
508	A couple of comments: It may be unduly complicated to get customers to provide the funding.
508	Perhaps we should focus on the banks instead.
508	The deal might be further funding in exchange for legislative and regulatory concessions on rates, transmission and generation siting and the rest of the items you outline.
508	Rubin would be great to have, but having watched Summers in action I'm notsure we need another ex-treas.
508	Summers is superb, up-to-speed, and apparently willing to work on this.
508	Linda -- how would Larry feel if we brought in his ex-boss (I know they're buddies but does Summers really needthe help?).
508	Need to keep an eye on the ball for large customers-- many of whom are oursthey will continue to need some access to better rates.
508	Perhaps the proposcould be converted to cash in exchange for demand reductions.

511	the format looks good to me.
511	I'd suggest that you prepare the talking points for Jeff and schedule some time to brief him in advance.
511	I got a response from ted on Fri to the voicemail i left for him.
511	It sounded like he fully understood your role and would take the appropriate steps with respect to the recruiters.
511	Is it straightened out now?
512	Please see the attached documents.
513	calendar and WGA meeting file
514	I think the documents look good.
514	I will discuss with Ken and Jeff (after finalizing a few outstanding items with these individuals).
515	Thanks for the update.
515	Any suggestions on anyone we might retain if this becomes a big "government to government" issue?

519	any interest?
520	revised version
521	I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.
521	He agreed: errors of commission are much better than errors of omission.
521	H e does want to be personally involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls next week to help get some confirmations.
521	Deal directly with him .
521	.
521	.
521	there's no need for me to be in the middle.
521	Also, a bit of background: Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before, but they don't want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press present.
521	Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing.
521	I felt overprepared -- which is just how I want to feel -- and every bit of information I needed was at my fingertips.
522	Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.
522	There are a couple of follow-up items: Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.
522	We have written this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.
522	Alan -- please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.
522	I think we should identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that could be sent to the FERC.
522	Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is necessary to address the California crisis.
522	We have identified the need for open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 2-4 month time frame.
522	Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.
522	Sue -- could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get them to Linda?
522	Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to "price gouge" -- yes, that's what she said.
522	She appealed to everyone's community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while California struggles to fix its problems.
522	I think we should send a response from Ken.
522	Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.
522	I think the basic messages should be: we are actively working on solutions with California policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc. We should also explain the nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.
523	We need to put a briefing book together for Ken ASAP for his California trip.
524	FYI -- Kalen is the head of HR for EES; she works for Beth Tilney.

529	Sorry I didn't have much time to talk yesterday.
529	The presentation went well.
529	We had a great turnout and Celeste, Andrew Miles and John Walt (and the other Enron attendees) did a great job.
529	I'm going to talk to Traci on Monday.
530	For some reason I couldn't get this message to Sherrie Sera.
530	Please forward.
530	Sherrie - see last item below.
531	I know you guys have been working around the clock.
531	I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten about Mike Dahlke (whose resume I sent on to you Dan).
531	When you catch a breath please take some time to consider Mike for
532	I have sent a reminder.
532	The EES team has been working around the clock on California matters, so I'm not surprised that they haven't focusses o this yet
533	Nice work, Mike

543	thanks.
543	It amazes me how many people saw C-span ...
543	I thought it was just for junkies like us.
543	I would like to get together in DC.
543	I don't have a date scheduled yet, but I seem to get there every other week or so.
544	corporate policy?
545	I just read the E-Speak transcript.
545	I think you did a great job!
545	I look forward to sitting down with you after we have gathered all the feedback from the website and other sources.
546	Great presentation, as always.
546	I think you should add a brief set of talking points: what are the key messages we want to convey?
546	what, if anything, can we ask Martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run?
546	Maureen: please get this to Ricardo (he's at the EBS offsite this am).
547	Looks fine as far as it goes ...
547	but don't we want to explain how this fits in to our strategy?
547	Is it just another platform for us to bring our products and prices to the market?
547	We have said with respect to EOL that the transaction is the goal not the platform.
547	Do we want to position this the same way?
547	Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a couple of months ago.
548	calendar and meeting file
549	I am attaching several items that I hope you will find useful when you brief Chambers: A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful).
549	This is an internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential (though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents).
549	A basic outline of solutions.
549	A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders.
549	(It's another internal analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems and solutions than we have seen before.
549	As we discussed on the phone, our biggest problem is inertia ...
549	we don't have much time, many solutions have long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.
549	Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura.
550	We move alot of people around Enron.
550	In fact, on an annual basis, we make about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).
550	We have found at Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased productivity and communication.
550	Given our tight office situation in Houston, moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused some disruption.
550	We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve later this year when we begin occupying the new building.
551	meeitng file
552	I am sooooooooooooo proud of you.
552	More importantly, you should be proud of you.
553	I concur
554	what do you think?
555	Ken has talked about EES willingness to invest this money in demand side management, if the right program were set up -- eg a demand buydown program.
556	do not circulate; fyi
557	Jean has responded to Rick and I. She doesn't feel that she has room in her budget to pick up a partial headcount.
558	Absolutely.
558	Feel free to use the content.
558	I forgot to give you Mike Day's number; it is: 415.765.8408.
558	As you'll recall, you asked for a California energy expert.
558	Mike certainly qualifies.
559	Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, Joshua Sheinkman.
559	As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more details.
559	Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of financial information.
559	The additional details they are looking for include: what information should be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made available and who should make it available.
559	On this last point, I suggested that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned utility, an ISO or an RTO).
559	I also pointed out that FERC could make this happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.
559	Extending FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the legislation.
559	Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and forward to Linda.
559	Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the legislation.
559	(Linda) It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction.
559	(Linda and Joe)
560	I agree with John's recommendations.
560	We have been doing surprisingly well in the press.
560	And, for the most part, those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology ...
560	we are not going to convert them.
561	Shelley and Jim, who should follow up?
562	This is an interesting idea.
563	thanks
564	Forward on if you find it helpful
565	Thank you very much for the note.
565	Sorry I am so late replying (I am on my way to another round -- House hearings this time -- and was recalling your note).
565	It is amazing to me how many people saw the hearing on C-span (nothing worthwhile on the Weather Channel, I guess).
565	Thanks again, and welcome aboard.
566	Take a look at the attached and let's discuss.
566	Maureen is in Vince Kaminski's group and wants to leave.
566	How about reg risk?
567	Please give me Amy's e-mail address.
567	I'd like to get in touch with her.
567	Thanks.
568	please include shirley on your california updates
569	Attached is the text I would like to use for the letters to Feinstein and Murkowski.
569	Please set up on my letterhead.
569	Linda or Tom -- any comments?
569	The Wyden letter is in good shape; I have given Maureen some minor handwritten edits.
569	It will go out this a.m. Thanks for everyone's patience.
570	Outstanding.
570	Congratulations, Lauren
571	Sorry, I think you should talk directly with Rosalee.
572	I'm going to be at the Hyatt in Sac.
572	tonight.
572	Could you send a hardcopy to me there?
573	yes
574	help is on the way.
574	We are going to establish some senior executive oversight as well as an executive director (probably someone who came through the program).
574	Charlene is going to be moving into a commercial role (which was the original plan when she was brought into the organization).
574	I'd be happy to talk to you in more detail when I get back to Houston.
575	There is also a california update call (used to be daily, now weekly).
575	Marcia Linton (Jim Steffes' assistant) can give you the call in information and add you to the distribution list.
576	Sean - is this anything we need to follow up on?
577	Firsst article attached refers to the 1946 Nebraska case I mentioned to youin DC
578	test
579	can you fill this out for me?
580	Thanks for the analysis.
580	We understand that McKinsey may be helping the Governor develop a demand buy down program.
580	Is this true?
581	Ken will be making a call to Bob Glynn at PG&E.
581	Please give the attached to Ken before the call.
582	can you help me wiht this?
583	any interest?
584	Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation: consider having some or all of these individuals as "guest speakers" rather than formal memebers.
584	You can still have them review information, do their homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics.
584	Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the Future.
584	He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.
585	yes
586	fyi - Jade Eaton is one of Lara's contacts at DOJ
587	I think I can recommend that the time be set aside, but it would be helpful if we pointed out to Emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear opportunity for Enron before we schedule the meeting.
587	Maybe you could use this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal.
588	I don't see a fit
589	I'm suggesting that we make progress on it before we agree to a CEO summit
590	Ask Karen for the distribution list she would like to send these to for today's 1:30 meeting.
590	Also please reserve 47c1 for the meeting so I can use the computer screen.
591	I'm not saying we should buy this service, but I do think we need some way of staying on top of TV spots mentioning Enron.
592	Thanks for the update.
592	The Western Governors remain the best avenue we have for preventing price caps and California's attempts to secede from the grid.
592	We need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues.
592	Attached is some text I have been using for correspondence with policy makers regarding California issues.
592	Feel free to use it.
593	Just received a voicemail from Stan.
593	He knows Mike; he does not have any spots for him right now.
593	My suspicion is that the EES discussions are not ultimately going to yield fruit.
593	We are probably going to have to discuss what's next.
594	I think this is a very interesting idea.
594	Please get with Bill D. and make sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go ahead.
595	How important is this fight to us now (see attached article on ExIm)?
596	Please see attached.
596	Rob, perhaps while in London you could stop by Mark's desk to discuss.
597	It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.
597	I have talked with John several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.
597	As a result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the proposed budget for "01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort). Having said that, my view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer issues associated with the asset sales. Do you agree?
598	I just checked with Jeff and Ken.
598	They are both out of the office that day.
598	Sorry it didn't work out.
599	Got a voicemail from Rob Walls.
599	They are (have been) looking into it.
600	Excerpts by email are fine.
600	Also, as I mentioned, I am very impressed with your background and accomplishments, but I would like to have you meet a couple of other people in my group before making a final offer.
600	Thanks and stay warm!
601	Make sure this is consistent with the lists we put in the memo.
601	thanks
602	This is an issue we need to stay on top of.
602	Felicia: could you please putsome background together for everyone on the list?
603	Here are the message points
604	Thanks for the note.
604	Jim Hughes asked the same question you did.
604	Here is my (and John's) response.
605	Sorry, I had saved your list for the Europe AA PRC and didn't include them in my draft of the memo.
605	I am sending another version shortly that has that information included.
605	I don't think I need anything more from you, unless you have other comments on the memo.
605	Thanks
606	Thanks for the message.
606	It's good to hear from you again.
606	We have already hired Racicot (who now works for Bracewell and Patterson), but I'm not sure that our arrangement would include what you may need, so I'm copying Linda Robertson in our DC office.
606	Also, I'll copy Jim Derrick so he knows we might expand our relationship there.
606	Linda and Joe - thoughts on BPA and EOL?
607	I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations.
607	The order provides for $69 million in "potential" refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification).
607	Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million).
607	It's not over yet, though.
607	The order deals only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark prices through April 01.
607	The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000).
607	With respect to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard.
607	I'm copying Jeff Dasovich because I'm sure he has more up to date information.
608	As to whether long term contracting by Cal.
608	is a good idea, the answer is somewhat mixed.
608	We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting.
608	Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases.
608	California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements.
608	In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases.
608	I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.
609	It was not mentioned to me.
609	I'm copying rosie and vanessa to find out if this was a simple referral (in which case you should keep the work to a minimum -- return the call, but don't get distracted from your other efforts) or whether Ken is especially interested in this and wants us to follow through.
610	I'm checking.
610	Melissa loves talking about Houston real estate (one of the many quirks I love her for).
610	I'll find out when she can do it.
611	Please post on internal site
612	looks ok to me
613	yes
614	I would just say Jeff is pres and ceo, not refer to him as Ken's replacement.
615	Ken was meeting with him the day before yesterday.
615	I'm just waiting to hear back.
616	Your assessment makes perfect sense to me.
616	What do you think about having Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what he might look for when his current assignment is over, etc. (obviously without identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business)?
616	I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem.
617	I can do it, but have to be at the airport before 2:00 for a flight to NY.
618	Perhaps we should consider putting something together on India?
619	The amendment was defeated
620	Joe -- could you see if someone at FERC -- Hebert or Madden, might be available -- or suggest a suitable alternative?
621	We have got to do better at this.
621	IR did a webcast of the annual meeting that from all reports had a minimum of glitches.
621	Can we use the same technology?
622	At the bottom of the string is Stacy's phone number
623	This is a very good try.
623	I think it comes off too defensive and too genera(I just don't think the topic lends itself to the format).
623	Here's what Ithink we should do: Jeff is filming a piece for etv about the stock price.
623	We should perhaps use, and expand upon, those messages.
623	This approach ismore directed at the bottom line: why our stock price should go up.
623	cc: Mary Clark/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Per Your Request Thanks Steve.
623	Here's an initial draft -- I've taken a very light "eBizy"approach to delivering the message.
623	Perhaps by having some fun with it wecan look a little less defensive.
623	Let me know if we're on track or pitifulway off.
623	Thanks.
623	Comparing Enron to Apples You may have noticed ) or you may be asking why ) industry analysts ocompare Enron to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs or investment bankslike Chase Manhattan.
623	We thought it was time to sort out any confusion between our businesses, just in case someone asks you to explain.
623	Here's how we're different from those guys: w Enron provides physical delivery of energy products to customers ) we are not just traders.
623	Those guys mainly act as brokers and do not participatephysically.
623	w Enron proactively seeks to reform and create markets.
623	Those guys simplyparticipate and compete.
623	w Enron extends its business model into new and deregulating markets, enabling high growth rates.
623	Those guys are in markets that generate lessaggressive growth rates.
623	w Enron owns physical assets that provide consistent cash flow, such as ourpipelines.
623	Those guys do not have them.
623	And if that's not enough, we think our employees are so much cooler than theirs.
623	To: Mary Clark/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Per Your Request Here are the message points
624	Can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity or at least promises a reexamination of the scope of the market making activity after some period of time.
624	Also, can we strengthen the language to give us something beyond simply a right to file -- which is a right we have anyway.
625	Hap -- could you provide a response and get it to Meredith.
625	I'd like to correct this.
626	looks good.
626	Rosie, you may want to include this in ken's file for the toronto trip
627	Drop the first comma in the first sentence of the third paragraph.
627	Otherwise good to go.
628	The memo going out on Monday discusses the corporate policy committee briefat the end.
628	The corporate policy committee does the MD PRC (evaluation ofMDs and promotions to MD), reviews the recommendations of the other committees (which we are just now forming).
628	Additionally, the corporate policy committee met to determine the membership and charters of the othercommittees (including the PRC committees).
628	The corporate policy committee is comprised of the most senior executives, including the Office of the Chairman, the leaders of the four business units and the heads of the corporate functions.
628	In addition to the specific items mentioned above, thcorporate policy committee was intended to discuss and resolve the major issues facing the company, including issues of strategy, personnel and challenges facing the company.
628	The corporate policy committee has met three times so far, so not much history yet.
628	Perhaps as further pronouncements issue from this august bodywe will make more of a point about where they came from.
628	Mary Clark cc: Subject: RE: Corporate Policy Committee Steve, please briefly describe what the policy committee does so we can respond to this employee question.
628	Thanks.
628	Mary
629	How about inserting the attached (after the explanation about the relationship between New Power and Enron)?
630	keep sending the message board quotes.
630	Sometimes when I open them I have trouble locating the specific quote (other times I'm taken right to it).
630	Do you imbed the URLs differently?
631	The quotes are accurate, but I did not say California does not have a supply problem.
632	The conversation was very positive (Glynn did not know anything about it at first, but, looked into it and called Ken back Friday evening).
632	Glynn said they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts, including this one, as soon as they get paid.
632	He said that this weekk would be focussed on finalizing a deal for SCE given the threat of bankruptcy; the discussions would then turn to PG&E.
633	I heard you were a big hit.
634	I just saw the NYT article.
634	Nice job.
634	It's nicely positioned as an issue about India's resolve to encourage foreign investment and live up to contracts.
635	He could have solved this problem in 20 minutes, right?
636	The revised statement looks good to me.
637	Congratulations on your new position!
637	This all came up rather suddenly, at least as far as I can tell.
637	If you have any interest, I would like to talk to you sometime.
638	Thanks.
638	Look forward to seeing you.
638	Sorry I left Jimmy off the note, I know he must be doing a good job.
639	Thanks.
639	I was glad to do it and would do it again...
639	next time my computer will work.
639	I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially regarding the PRC.
640	What's this about?
640	Could you e-mail Dave and I with the background, any effect on us, etc.?
640	Why was Dave on this distribution?
641	Thanks for the offer.
641	I may take you up on it.
642	I would hold off for now.
642	I think, based on our discussion, that Ira might be a fit for my organization or EES.
642	Unfortunately, I am heading out of town with my family on the 12th (unfortunate for meeting with Ira , not unfortunate for me) and EES has new leadership who is trying to assess the state of things before making new senior level hires.
642	So, let's wait a bit.
642	Thanks
643	Your understanding was correct.
643	In light of recent changes in the California regulatory environment (eg the recent rate order) I don't think it makes sense for us to distribute the document at this time, so you can ignore the request.
643	Thanks
644	Linda - as we discussed, adding a sentence on open access is key.
644	Also, I would delete the sentence about the transmission system not being designed for the way it's being used today.
645	Maureen, please schedule some time on my calendar for Littlechild.
646	Thanks for the note.
646	I am forwarding it on to our analyst and associate recruiting program leaders.
646	We may have already filled the summer spots (we also cut down the number a bit this year to ensure a higher quality experience), but we will be out looking for a large number of permanent hires in the Fall.
647	See last question.
648	Mark also forwarded a voicemail from Doty.
648	Doty goes into great length about his discussions with Gramm (both of them) and professes to have not only a good relationship but also the support of the Senator.
648	At this point, any reason not to get the letter prepared for Ken's signature?
649	I am calling Rob Walls to see if he can attend.
650	No. Any idea how these guys are finding out where Jeff is going?
650	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
651	Tell him we are sending his note on to the appropriate person.
652	Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn: Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.
652	Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.
652	The list is nonbinding, however.
652	PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.
652	Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).
652	You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing.
652	(Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).
652	Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.
652	There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).
653	I agree with Mark's changes and I think the memo is good to go.
654	I talked with Ken yesterday.
654	He would like to keep David on until May 15 to finish up some things he is working on for Ken.
654	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
655	I would decline Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
656	Eliz- can you handle?
657	Never mind ...
657	I found 'em.
658	could you look into this for me?
659	yes, send to dennis Stacy Walker@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS
660	Attached is the information on talent moves within Enron.
660	The numbers are for Enron's domestic workforce only.
660	The bottom line is that the EBS and EES redeployment figures are not unusual for Enron: We moved over 3000 employees last year (about 25% of our domestic workforce).
660	Most of these moves are attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of business transfers within the company.
660	The formal redeployment process makes up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company.
661	I didn't sell any, right?
662	Good brief.
662	I have noted a few comments and questions throughout the text.
662	Ignore my universal change to the word "transmissions".
663	Thanks so much for your message.
663	Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite.
663	I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.
663	I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.
663	I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him.
663	John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office.
663	Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question.
663	It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs.
663	A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.
663	Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.
663	When Andre left, we reduced the corporate function to a "default provider" role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area.
663	With the reorganization of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle).
663	John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week.
663	I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.
663	It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation.
663	John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK.
663	He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).
663	The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying "we're from corporate and we're here to help".
663	If you don't need any "help" or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me know.
664	You are awesome.
665	Thanks for taking the lead on this.
665	Note Tim's question about handicapping the liklihood of approval.
665	Prices will move in the West based on these odds.
665	We need to have a better view than anyone else.
666	Thanks for handling.
666	Let me know if it begins to interfere unduly with your new responsibilities.
667	Thanks for the updated presentation.
667	It helps me a great deal to keep up with you guys.
667	Send more as you do them.
668	Do what you need to do; the system has to work.
668	The only question I have is: why doesn't IT just take care of this without a charge?
668	This is not an extraordinary item or special request.
668	This ought to be something IT simply takes care of without us having to get involved or pay extra.
668	Am I missing something?
669	No charges.
669	I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest.
669	In this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in the finance group in London.
669	That way, we can make a better determination about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in pitching them on doing bus.
669	with Enron can be involved.
669	Or, we can make a determination to decline.
669	I think we decide who we want to let in then do it for free, rather than charging.
670	I would'nt have it introduced by the "corporate policy committee".
670	I would say Enron is introducing or "there is a new tool available to you".
670	I am anxious to see how this goes over; it's a great tool.
671	Please get me Pat Wood's phone number and post a reminder on my calendar to call him ASAP
672	calendar
673	I think Jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on this (and future air and climate change position inquiries).
673	Jeff - please make sure you get the comments of all involved.
674	I got a voicemail response from Jeff - he is fine with me substituting for him on the Japan trip.
675	I got a voicemail fro Ken.
675	He would be happy to meet with Freeman.
675	He is willing to work on other times, but suggested the following After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing to do this if necessary) His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early morning on the third.
675	Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down?
676	See natural gas price article below.
676	Our buddy Paul Carpenter has turned ous (not to mention that he seems to be talking nonsense).
676	How about givinghim a call?
677	calendar
678	I think Mike should sign
679	I'll give 150.
679	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
680	Yes
681	Jean - please get in touch with Greg.
682	Suggested changes are highlighted below.
683	Cindy - this looks like it might be an opportunity for you or David to reach your target audience.
684	meeting folder
685	I already responded to this.
685	Print for my meeting file.
686	I will need an LCD projector and a computer (or connections for my computer) so that I can show the presentation.
686	Thanks.
687	We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.
687	We need to get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.
687	Shelley -- could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.
687	Should Joe or I (or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?
688	Ken talked to Sen Kinder.
688	He made the points you had prepared.
688	Kinder agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.
688	He said he had been hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help competition develop in the state.
688	He expressed willingness to work with us on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's offices.
688	He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come to Houston around that time.
689	I think wholesale will be well covered.
689	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
690	I think it's a good idea, but we will need a different summary ...
690	either limit the summary to a couple of key points or provide an explanation, in layman's terms, of the practical effect of each of the changes.
691	Go ahead.
692	Have we made this available to the Cheney team?
693	Congratulations on your appointment by Fox.
693	That's great news.
693	I continue to be impressed by the way Fox is handling things.
693	Let me know what I can do to help.
693	As you know we are looking for a replacement for the unreplaceable Ricardo Charvel.
693	I know you and he have discussed some possibilities.
693	Rick Shapiro has met several candidates and will be bringing two to Houston in the next week or so.
693	Dr. Kean continues to improve her golf game while I slave away at Enron to cover the greens fees.
693	Let me know when you are coming to town next.
694	Please coordinate with PGE on the comments.
695	I forgot to email myself the brief to track changes, but here are my changes in writing: p.
695	1: Para starting "focusing on the latter," that sentence, change "get creative" to be innavotaive in its approach."
695	p. 2: 1st full Paragraph, Second sentence, change "uniting" to "common" and there is a typo on line5, reduction n consumption. Should be "of" page 6: We need the RR for PG&E. Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal, unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period. We told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times in the brief. We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices, as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed. page 8: 2. Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete "between" in first sentence. page 9: Second full paragraph, begining "Again, the UDS's, " Second sentence, sited should be "cited" p. 12: First full paragraph beginning "A primary component," Insert a sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak. Second full parag, beginning, "Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about arbitrariness in there too.
695	And change "more necessary goal" in 4th sentence to "more critical goal" I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott, so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to.
695	I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the 9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).
695	But I will communicate with Harry and everyone else before then.
695	Thanks.
696	FYI.
696	I think they should try to get in to see Lundquist, but I don't think we need to participate in this.
696	We have been focussed on nation-wide issues when we have had the opportunity to meet with Lundquist and I don't think we should use our limited shots here.
697	Nice work Kerry and Barb.
697	I think we should do the follow up work on setting a follow up meeting with the Senator.
697	Ken left it open whether he would be available when the Sen is in Houston, so we have made no commitment in that regard.
698	Could you coordinate with Cindy Stark on the meeting with Massey in a couple of weeks?
698	Stan has asked me if I would like to attend.
698	I would, but don't know when exactly it is scheduled for.
699	I have advised against Ken or Jeff attending the generators meeting: Ken is still willing to make time avail on the 3d to meet with the gov.
700	One minor edit
701	looks good
702	looks good
703	This is an issue we have long struggled with.
703	We have conducted several comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be considered in the prioritization and resource allocation process.
703	I think the project is a good idea.
703	Your sources would be John, Jim Steffes, and Rick Shapiro (for the RCR, or resource commitment process).
704	calendar fyi
705	mo - calendar Rob - fyi, upcoming speech
706	We are concerned about leaks to the press which may have ocurred from our Washington office over the last few months (including leaks from a former employee).
706	Could you put someone in touch with Rick and Linda Robertson (head of our DC office)?
707	Looks fine to me.
707	I have not cross checked the lists, but I assume you have included everyone who was designated to serve on the PRCs per the original memo (in addition to the new bus unit additions)
708	no objection
709	A memo is coming out shortly.
710	I think the memo needs some additional work.
710	I have made a number of suggestion (highlighted on the attached).
711	meeting file
712	Thanks for the invite (and the follow up voicemail).
712	I'd love to see the General (and you of course), but I'm going to have to pass.
712	Thanks anyway.
713	OK by me.
714	OK by me.
715	I think we should let people in the legislature know about this and see if one or more of them can get their hands on it.
716	I think the meeting is on Wednesday, but if you can be there (Sacremento, I expect) you should.
716	As I mentioned in my voicemail, I think the meeting will not be particularly substantive; more likely it is a photo op for the governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators.
716	Based on your message below, should we still plan to send somebody?
716	I still think we should if we can manage the legal risk.
716	Mike: would you be able to attend as well?
717	Minor changes shown on the attached (gotta get the big guy's title right).
718	Please add Linda Robertson (Head of our DC office) to this list if that's ok.
719	I love you, baby.
719	Study hard.
720	Thanks for the invite.
720	I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas government/regulatory affairs team.
720	She is certainly more familiar with the details (of which there will be many more after this legislative session and the conclusion of the pilot program).
720	She is also a very good speaker (and can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up).
721	Please get available dates.
721	I need to be there for this.
722	I left Hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too.
722	I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines: gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state.
722	gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity.
722	gas utilities fialed to fill storage.
722	gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets.
722	In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California, not outside.
723	please forward to Vicky Sharp.
724	Forward to whomever you see fit.
724	It looks like an opportunity to explain price risk management to large customers.
725	Steve - take a look at this and contact the sponsor with a yes or no.
725	Thanks
726	Decline is ok.
726	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
727	I think the presentation looks fine, but consider adding this: there is real risk to utilities (as well as customers) in continuing a regulated regime.
727	The California utilities have been pushed into or to the brink of bankruptcy
728	The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides: the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for utilities.
728	California's utilities were pushed to the brink of, or into, bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to them.
728	All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are conducted in a marketplace.
728	Also, did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently?
729	prepare for my siganture.

730	Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.
730	Three expressed willingness to help.
730	Scott McNealy (Sun): contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.
730	Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a "cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the political leaders and our response to that comeback.
730	He says he hasn't spent time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of suggested contacts.
730	Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.
730	Sharer wants the same information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to call a meeting of other California CEOs.
730	Sharer will also be having breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today.
730	Robert Day (Trust Co of the West): said that he is very close to the mayor of Los Angeles.
730	He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).
730	Ken would like some talking points for that call.
730	Jeff - please put these items together.
731	I'd be happy to call Nickles.
732	Portland General called.
732	They have heard that Defazio is going to propose in a press release that the state of Oregon should buy PGE.
733	Attached is the document I mentioned.
733	You will get a separate e-mail from Karen Denne which will include the invitation and the invited for the Thursday meeting.
733	My contact information: Steven J Kean EVP and Chief of Staff Enron Corp pager: 888.906.9761 Asst Maureen McVicker 713.853.1808 I will be in Japan most of next week, but my office can reach me.
733	Thanks
734	There were several items in the mail pouch that you needed a response form me on.
734	Here are the responses: Marchris forwarded a request to attend a conference on Aug 19 and 20.
734	I think the original invite when to Ken and Jeff.
734	I will attend, subject to them getting some reasonable response rate from the commissioners they invited and provided that I get a speaking or similar participation opportunity.
734	SMU professor and student asking for Astros tickets - yes CERA conference on July 10-12 in Scotland -- decline
735	include on the distribution list and send out note about the Monday meeting.
736	Thanks for the explanation.
736	I agree, though I may not have explained the context adequately to Ken.
737	Sorry, I got overwhelmed by California.
737	I have not talked to Ken yet and will be in Japan until Friday.
737	Perhaps we can hook up then?
738	I have opened a new Lotus file "California - working group" where I am keeping the contact information, but I am assuming you have picked everybody up already.
738	If in doubt, check out the file.
738	thanks
739	Stay in touch with linda ro the recommendation.
740	Thanks for the update.
741	Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options.
741	Specifically, they want to know what the exercise policy is on i) termination eg as a result of the prc process, ii) voluntary departure, iii) retirement, or iv)resignation; and to what extent do the rules vary across plans: i) AESOP, LTIP, deferred bonus etc. The main focus is on the length of time to exercise.
741	I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the structure -- eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than employees who just leave voluntarily ( ie if you want to have a full three years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company?
742	Sorry for the delay.
742	I have asked the question and should have an answer in a day or two.
742	.
742	.
742	.
742	don't do anything rash in the meantime.
743	Linda - I haven't heard of these guys.
743	Do you know them?
744	One minor point: the response to the first data request implies that all employees went through the PRC process in 2000.
744	I am not sure this is accurate.
744	It's fair to say that most did, but I believe that the field employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through the PRC process.
745	Joe is working with the Governor's office and so should go on that list, not the sellers list.
746	You should also check my folder "California - working group"
747	I'm envious.
747	See you when you get back
748	Congrats Ray.
748	...
748	Now, get FERC to do something amazing.
749	fyi -- further distribute this message as you see fit.
750	Thank you for the information.
750	Unfortunately, we are not interested at this time.
751	Is this a 2001 question?
751	If so it seems to me we shouldn't bother with it.
751	If this is a 2002 question, then let;s discuss
752	Feel free to call me at 713.853.1586.
753	Please set up some time with Linda.
754	Yes, please.
755	Thanks.
755	Yes, I did know about the conference.
755	Ken has a copy of the study and made reference to it several times during our visits to Sac.
755	a couple of weeks ago.
755	It's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in California.
755	I look forward to catching up with you when I get back to town.
756	I'd prefer to skip.
756	How big of a problem would that be?
757	I'll do it.
757	I saw Steve Reynolds (the govs assistant), today, and told him I would do it.
757	I have a lot of respect for Geringer.
757	I may try to persuade them that they should reach out to FERC and Congress as a state that sees the need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages FERC to act.
757	Any background you have would be most appreciated.
758	What do you make of this?
759	This is a thorough and helpful analysis.
759	But, have we considered the broader emergency powers the president might have (i.e. beyond the clean air act waivers requested by a governor)?
759	It would seem that the importance of the defense business in California, the large number of military facilities, the public safety hazards of widespread blackouts, etc. ought to trigger some broader authority.
760	I think we need to keep the pressure on.
760	I liked the way our basic messagewas evolving over the course of last week.
760	As you pointed out, the Japanesutilities view us as just another annoying US company who is going to comein, bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave.
760	We neeto continue to reinforce the message that not only are we not going away, ware starting other businesses here to keep us going while we continue to agitate for reform in the electricity sector.
761	Is there anything we can tell them about the rates they should expect from the utility?
761	I think that will be the biggest concern and we can reduce backlash if we can provide them some information.
762	I just spoke with Clark Smith, head of Elpaso's merchant arm.
762	I told him that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in Western gas markets.
762	He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was spreading the rumor (I told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources).
762	He acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it had been identified as such; and said he would bring it up on his call with his Washington team this afternoon.
762	I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been done).
762	I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El Paso pointed to us.
762	Can anybody give some info on that?
763	Please send any comments directly to Peggy.
764	This looks like a run-of-the-mill conference except that the guest list is fairly senior.
764	Any interest?
764	If not, let Amy know.
765	Looks good to me.
765	I'm glad you had the chance to work with Linda.
766	Is Jeff available?
767	thanks
768	Thanks.
768	We are preparing a memo (John has seen it) to go out to each of our offices telling them about this incident (and the related ones that occurred the same day) and including some tips on how to handle such confrontations in the future.
769	Could you please put together a combined presentation : Enron's strategy and the need for open access on the transmission system?
770	I'll be happy to accomodate.
770	I can take you through Enron's view of how markets overall are evolving and how we approach those markets.
770	I'd also like to spend some time reviewing interstate transmission policy and how it affects Western energy markets.
771	Fax the attached word document to Jeff ASAP, thanks.
772	We are discontinuing the executive car wash.
772	You, Steve and I should talk.
773	I saw your e-mail response.
773	Did it go to Oxley too?
774	Is this it?
774	I thought we had heard it from "3 or 4" sources.
774	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
775	I think it starts off a bit too hot.
775	I would pull up some of the arguments you make about the need for additional supply and the importance of electricity to our way of life.
775	I'd then go into a discussion of the debacle in the West (and how they are now playing catchup - with loud, polluting diesel generators ... as was reported today).
775	Then I'd go into how our plants in Florida represent a very reasonable, inobtrusive solution for Florida.
776	Maureen - please forward on to Barry when you get his e-mail address.
776	Barry - I don't know Humberto personally, but looking over his resume, I thought he might be a fit in your organization.
777	Humberto - I forwarded your resume to Barry Hunsaker who is general counsel at EOG Resources.
777	As you may know, EOG used to be Enron Oil and Gas, a majority-owned Enron subsidiary.
777	A couple of years ago, Enron sold its interest in EOG and it became a stand alone company.
777	EOG Resources has been doing very well.
777	I don't know if they are looking for lawyers now, but I think I sent your resume to the right place.
778	enjoy!
779	Yes.
779	Mary will discuss with you.
780	Attached are my edits.
781	per my voicemail
782	See my revisions (and one question).
782	Let's revise and circulate.

786	Looks fairly minor: a 7500 dollar "contribution" to the US Treasury to settle up for our failure to seek license transfer authorization from the FCC for PGE's telecommunications licenses when we merged in 1997.
787	I think it would be a good idea to get together.
787	I would include Eric Thode as he has been living through the PR battles on a daily basis.
788	Please call before you leave and please send me your contact information when you have it for your new job.
788	thanks
789	Houston has experienced catastrophic flooding.
789	My flight has been cancelled.
789	It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I should try.
789	I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.
789	I don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 15 minute speech.
789	what do you think?
789	phone 713.621.6550
790	I'm not sure yet.
790	I think we are going to be sending two memos -- one that I am working on and on that Andy is working on.
790	It looks to me like the message below fits better into Andy's memo.
790	I don't think they will be combined into one, but I'll know more tomorrow.
791	The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen.
792	As we discussed...
792	The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen McVicker (my assistant).
793	Attached is the draft.
793	It combines all three announcements into one, with a common format.
793	It reflects a "just the facts" approach.
793	Let me know if you have changes (or answers to the questions in the text).
794	Looks fine to me.
794	Maureen - please keep on file
795	Will you be filling out mine?
796	We may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee, but I think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway.
796	I'm sure we'll have something we'll need to talk about.
797	John Brindle, David Cromley and others in the Corporate Business Controls group (formerly part of EBS) have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of Dabhol if there are threats to their safety.
797	While no plan is perfectly reliable (particularly during monsoon season) we believe that we are as ready as we can be.
798	Looks good; nice work.
798	Let's get it out
799	Can one of you forward to Ed, or whoever you feel appropriate?
800	Please update my bio to include Human Resources and add some boilerplate on Enron.
801	You may have seen this when it first came out a while back ...
801	but it's worth a rerun.
802	Please call me.
803	Would it be possible to use LiveLink to capture the information we gathered for the organization/budget review (such as functions of the different groups and the roles and responsibilities of the different individuals, budgets etc)?
803	I hate to see all that ggod information sit idle.
804	I think you are right.
804	I thought we were going to do both.
805	I set up a meeting for next Friday in Washington with Ed G. and Ralph Reed, starting at 7:30 am.
806	Here it is
807	Thank you...I think
808	Attached is Jeff's backgrounder in the event you call Hertzberg.
809	No need to review with policy committee.
810	I am having lunch on Monday with Michael Isikoff, a newsweek investigative reporter.
810	He is doing yet another Ken Lay/Enron political influence story.
810	One of the things he wants to talk about though -- and I think this is a good sign -- is Enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the administration's.
810	What I need from you, as soon as possible, is a timeline (what the Administration said when -- doesn't have to be down to the day); the Administrations position; and our position (and how they differ).
810	Borrow heavily from existing materials.
811	Ken left a msg for me on Sunday.
811	He was able to return Bryson's call.
811	Not much new: Ken got Jeff's paper will try to reach Hertzberg on Monday.
811	Bryson gave an update (very consistent with yours on Fri) Wants us to think creatively about "how to keep DWR contracts from preventing the comprehensive solution" and how to address the concerns of the state treasurer.
811	Ken tried to reach Pete Peterson (Blackstone) but did not make contact.
812	Fyi - price cap events of the week.
813	Thanks anyway.
813	no need to do anything right now.
813	enjoy your vacation.
814	I get in too late tonight, but maybe dinner or drinks on Thurs?

819	Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue.
819	Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!
820	You may want to forward this to your customers.
821	Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who.
822	You may want to forward this to your customers.
823	Sorry for the delay (I had major e-mail problems).
823	The memo looks good; let's get it out.
824	Has this gone to Ken yet.
824	If not please send.
825	Has this gone to Ken yet.
825	If not please send.
826	Ken hasn't mentioned it.
826	I'll ask next time I talk to him.
827	Please add Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchens to updates with significant news like this one (they may already get them ... I didn't read through all the names).
828	Thank you.
828	I enjoyed the discussion very much.
828	The DoD has significant challenges, but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication, they have some first rate people working on those challenges.
828	If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call.
829	You have probably heard this already, but on July3, the CPUC postponed their direct access decision until mid-August.
830	FYI - itinerary.
831	I have looked it over.
831	I think they would do a good job.
831	Another idea: Dick Foster (advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey) has a great book out: "Creative Destruction".
831	I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research.
831	He is a very good presenter; he knows Enron well; and his work is first rate.
831	He might be a good addition.
831	I have an idea on the breakout sessions.
831	It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you.
832	Follow up to previous message: I would not have "managing for the slow down" on the agenda.
832	I don't think it is as relevant to our business as it is to many others.
833	I think this letter looks fine.
833	For the hororarium, I suggest we use whatever we paid Kudlow for his participation (I believe Ken also entered into a consulting contract with Kudlow, but I'm referring only to the one-time payment for the advisory council meeting he attended).
834	Looks good to me.
835	Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?
835	I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.
835	Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings?
836	I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc).
837	Yes.
837	Maureen - please schedule.
838	calendar
839	I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU.
839	Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today.
840	Yes.
840	Maureen - please schedule.

842	Please see the attached.
843	I am so sorry.
843	You guys gave him a really good life.
844	George "Herbert Hoover" Bush.
845	My suggestions are attached.
845	Take the gloves off.
846	I am so sorry.
846	You guys gave him a really good life.
847	George "Herbert Hoover" Bush.
848	My suggestions are attached.
848	Take the gloves off.
849	I love you.
849	Call me.
850	I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.
850	The document is still too rough to send out.
850	We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.
850	California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.
850	We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.
850	We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.
851	As discussed.
852	Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?
852	If so, please handle; otherwise let me know.
853	The letter looks good.
853	A couple of comments for your consideration: On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.
853	Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?
853	Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.
853	Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).
853	The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.
853	Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.
853	What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.
853	The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.
853	The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).
853	These components of the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.
853	They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative. But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of "prosecutorial discretion". I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.
854	I love you.
854	Call me.
855	As discussed.
856	My comments are attached.
856	I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading.
857	I couldn't open link.
857	I s this something new for me to sign or have I already complied?
858	Attached is the final letter.
858	Please note - there was a small change at the top of page 2.
859	See attached
860	Great summary.
860	I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but I have one other thought we should discuss internally.
860	Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved), etc. This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system.

862	I'm still a junkie ....
862	please email copies of the orders.
863	I'm glad things are moving forward.
863	I've talked with Dave briefly and willfollow up with him again.
863	Kevin Scott on 07/13/2001 10:14:01 AM Please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net
864	I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.
864	Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone.
865	See last story attached.
865	Congratulations, it looks like you are shaking things up in typical Enron fashion.
866	See last point: MIT would like to talk to us about energy procurement and management.
866	Could you put someone in touch with them?
867	I'm still a junkie ....
867	please email copies of the orders.
868	Thanks for getting on top of this.
868	Please get the word out to the HR team leaders as soon as you know more.
869	I'm glad things are moving forward.
869	I've talked with Dave briefly and will follow up with him again.
869	Kevin Scott on 07/13/2001 10:14:01 AM Please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net
870	Let's talk.
870	While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.
871	Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.
871	Most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.
871	Could you forward this to Palmer ...
871	for some reason my address book doesn't pull him up when I'm off the system.
872	Bonnie: Please forward to Michael Kirby.
872	I think the draft looks good.
872	Could you also prepare a draft of the letter we discussed yesterday to convey the proposal to the committee?
873	Great news.
873	With respect to the Commissoners, I think it makes sense to go back through Ellen and ask if she could set up meetings with a few commissioners ater the staff briefing.
873	Please respond to
874	I kept your contact list, but now I can't find the CV you sent.
874	Would you mind resending?

875	Rick -- I'm so sorry to hear about this, but I'm glad the outlook is good.
875	Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

877	Can you circulate the link to Cal TV again?
877	Please respond to

879	Can you circulate the link to Cal TV again?
879	Please respond to
880	OK with you?
881	Congrats
882	OK
883	We should include David Oxley -- VP of human resources.
884	looks fine
885	Attached is a draft of the Agenda we discussed.
885	Irwin - I show Joskow on here but he has already declined (his wife is having surgery right before our meeting date).
885	We may want to consider someone like Seabron Adamson (Frontier Economics) or perhaps someone else.
886	Congrats
887	I would like to see research from all of these sources on areas of interest to enron -- energy and broadband, North America and Europe.
887	Thanks
888	OK
889	We should include David Oxley -- VP of human resources.
890	looks fine
891	No. We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.
891	Thanks
892	This is Steve Kean's PAB
893	No change.
893	The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.
893	We need to discuss the communication of the changes.
893	My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.
893	Is that right?
893	Is it all employees or only US based?
894	I have a question related to your former responsibilities: As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).
894	With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.
894	My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.
894	What do you think?
895	Call at 5:00 today (3:00 your time), if you can.
896	The attachment was scrambled.
896	Can you send in word format?
897	Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.
897	Please see attached spreadsheet.
897	As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).
897	The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.
897	Have a look and let's talk.
898	I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I'm not making the case for a different "tilt" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.
898	Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.
898	Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send.
899	Looks fine to me, but I would change the second sentence to refer to the "council" meeting twice per year (as opposed to "committee")
900	Looks good to me (I would not invite Glynn to dinner the night before, though).
901	Please forward to Ralph Reed
902	Jerry was one of the people from Mercatus conducting a seminar on financial and physical markets for FERC staff
903	I don't have a role for Tom at this time, but I appreciate the interest.
904	Looks fine to me
905	Ken had suggested that we try to get Schmalensee (sp?) for the October meeting as a substitute for Joskow.
905	What do you think?
906	My God ...
906	this will be a lot of work.
906	How much of this can be pushed to the supervisors?
907	I'll do lunch with Sue
908	Letter looks good to me.
909	I've been thinking about this.
909	Due to limited battery life, calling areas etc, I'm not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go.
909	I'm thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into.
910	per my voicemail
911	Please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals
912	OK
913	I need the following changes to Outlook: I need my file folders to be "active" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline.
913	I need my "inbox" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don't want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.
913	I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline.
914	Let's discuss.
914	I think we should emphasize, at the outset, our proposed solution.
915	Amy Kim is still an open question.
915	I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.
915	Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?
915	I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.
915	I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past).
916	I've been thinking about the need to recast the "e-commerce" position as well.
916	I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks.
917	What do we think it means for the pace of reform?
917	Is it a mandate?
918	This is still confusing to me.
918	I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached).
919	I made some modifications, but we may want to make more ...
919	I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer.
919	The audience should be redefined as the Senators, not just the members of the committee.
919	Let's discuss.
920	JoAnn Hill is on vacation; I'll look into it.
921	Ken -- the process description (i.e. where Brown could play a key role) is discussed in the middle of the update document.
922	Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.
922	He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.
922	Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week: Listing of who is owed how much in California Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
922	Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.
922	The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.
922	Please let me know who will take the lead on this.
923	See attached.
924	Attached are the drafts as of Sunday:
925	Let Maggie know.
925	I love you.
926	I think you do need to be there.
927	Revised documents (reflecting less definitive statements on earnings)
928	revised with kll comments (still need to include all employee memo).
929	I'd like a copy of this.
930	I wrote some comments last night.
930	Maureen will fax this am.
930	As you will see, I have some deep concerns about the story -- content and the prudence of doing such a story.
931	including all employee memo
932	Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.
932	The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.
932	A few highlights from this report: The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
932	Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
932	Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.
932	However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
932	Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.
933	draft of Ken's remarks.
934	test
935	Let's send it out.
936	See below.
936	These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).
936	The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.
937	I left a message.
937	Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys.
938	Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its management in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.
938	I have refrained from responding until now.
938	Below (and in the attached in Word format) is a letter I hope you will print.
938	If you wish to contact me, you can call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).
938	Thank you for your consideration.
938	Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp. It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron ("Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).
938	His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.
938	He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.
938	Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.
938	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart.
938	He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.
938	We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.
938	Ironically, the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.
938	Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.
938	The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.
938	So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.
938	Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp.
939	I got fed up with Krugman .
939	.
939	.
939	sent this out this am.
940	OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons, or does he already have it?
940	I think #90 might be at the heart of the matter.
940	If we kept the class size smaller, we could be more selective, pay more for the higher quality talent, make more meaningful assignments, and provide for a more active mentoring and development program.
941	We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.
941	Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato
942	I received an auto-reply email from Terry Tang indicating that she is on vacation and that I should forward this to you.
942	In the meantime, I have spoken to Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO.
942	He said that he would be happy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for publication.
942	Let me know.
943	This is great.
943	Rick, Jim and Elizabeth, we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization.
944	David, please forward to the appropriate person.
945	Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.
945	Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.
945	As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.
945	For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.
945	Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.
945	Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.
946	Thanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.
946	Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.
946	Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.
946	As much as I enjoyed working with Jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by Ken's obvious competence, calm, and heart.
946	I have never felt better about working here.
947	See attached.
947	Christie -- please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones.
947	Maureen -- please put on my letterhead.
948	I haven't forgotten.
948	I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days.
949	I see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.
949	Alot of my people are outside of Houston.
949	Are they solicited anyway?
949	When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my Houston-based and outside Houston numbers.
950	Thanks, Rob.
950	I was "writing angry" so I wasn't sure how it would come off.
950	I did have my wife take a look and she assures me I didn't go "overboard"|
951	At the end of this string is a letter reply to Mr. Krugman's most recent column.
951	As indicated below, Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO, would be happy to put his name to the letter.
951	That would be our preference.
951	Let me know if you need anything more.
952	now what?
953	I think you are the right person to get this.
953	If not, please let me know as soon as possible.
953	See reply to Krugman's August 17 column at the end of this email string.
953	Ken Lay, Enron's Chairman and CEO is putting his name to the letter and we would prefer that you publish it as such.
954	Thanks for the list.
954	One clarification: What do you mean by the sentence starting "How challenged are we really . . ."
955	Well, I guess when you lose 80% of your ad revenue you get a little sensitive.
955	.
955	.
955	I wouldn't say I berated him; it was more like merciless hassling.
956	no message was attached
957	Many quotes from KP -- the Eastern Power Markets Oracle.
957	On balance a good article.
957	Thanks for helping out.
958	I believe we have this already.
958	John B could you send a copy to John S.
959	I think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes.
960	Look at the topic below.
960	Should we send somebody?
961	We are responding.
961	I'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who's burning out?
962	Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.
962	Some further questions: Are we required to have a formal severance plan?
962	Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?
962	If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?
962	My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.
962	Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.
962	Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?
963	I talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.
963	I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.
963	He said he would be interested.
963	If you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number.
964	Do we have a time for me to meet with Gil yet?
965	I know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.
965	It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.
965	I told Bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).
965	I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ...
965	but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob's resume along.
966	Please put a confidential backgrounder re Rod Wright for Lay and I. I'll be joining he and Ken for at least part of the discussion.
966	Don't know/ havent heard anything re LOng Beach
967	Meeting not unitl 9/24
968	Please discuss with Vince.
968	I don't know how to engage relative importance
969	Jeff's number is 713.621.8620.
969	He has left for a whitewater rafting trip and won't be back for a couple of weeks I think.
970	Ask IR
971	I think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now.
971	But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.
971	We should be positioned for a great period of growth.
972	Honey, would you post this in the chatrooms?
973	I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.
973	A couple of requests: Could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting?
973	We are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.
973	Call when you get a chance.
973	713.853.1586.
973	Thanks.
974	recurring item for calendar
975	Hold on.
975	Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.
975	For what it's worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.
975	But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make.
976	I think we should have a version which says that "ken Lay named ... " I don't know that the Board actually does the electing, I think Ken may just be making sure that they are OK with his decision.
976	I will confirm.
977	We still do and you should go if you can.
977	The next one is in London in October.
977	Joannie will be handling the logistics.
977	I am asking Maureen to send you the dates.
978	Do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with Gov. Geringer.
978	Also, I would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in Wyoming.
979	Bill -- fyi.
979	I don't want you to take any action on this until we have talked (i.e. please don't forward this or talk to the people involved yet).
979	Let's talk when you have a minute.
980	Please process the following effective July 1: David Oxley and Mary Joyce base pay increase to 250,000.
980	(Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley's situation with the EWS O of C.).
980	Mark Palmer (PR) to 225,000.
980	(Note: I previously asked Mary Joyce to review Mark's position and this is the amount we agreed on).
980	I would also like to review Shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities.
981	See attached
982	Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson?
983	fine
984	[Kean, Steven J.]
985	Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.
985	He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.
985	He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.
985	He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on): Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood A "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes. Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened. Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.
986	I couldn't find what I was being asked to approve
987	Welcome and thanks for contacting me.
987	Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
987	I'll ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks.
987	Maybe we could have lunch?
987	Also, my wife is working with the Dean of the Rice engineering school on a history of engineering at Rice.
987	If your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in Houston, we may be able to help out.
988	decline
989	per my voicemail
990	Here is the slide presentation we were talking about this morning.
991	Thanks for your interest.
991	We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message.
992	Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.
992	Some of her work was presented by her colleague and Enron Advisory Council member -- Pankaj Ghemewat.
993	thanks
994	Please coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I'd like her to be at meeting.
995	this is what I was talking about this morning
996	This is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk: effective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.
996	If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals: Steve Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550) John Brindle Senior Director, Business Controls (3-3843) John Presley Business Controls Please deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect.
997	Let's just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments.
997	Thanks
998	As we discussed
999	I have forwarded this to Fitch.
999	You should compare with your list and consolidate (or have Gary consolidate) onto one.
1000	I talked to Ken yesterday and he is fine with this.
1001	What does "held" mean?
1001	Do they start over or do they pick up where they left off?
1002	Thanks
1003	Thanks for all you are doing
1004	This is fully consistent with what we are communicating throughout the organization
1005	We are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc. Terrie James is working with Ken on speakers.
1005	It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today.
1006	Thanks for the inquiry.
1006	We do not have an interest in sponsorship.
1007	please print attachements also
1008	please find Bob Lane's phone number for Rick
1009	thank you and good luck.
1009	Stay in touch
1010	I talked to Ken yesterday.
1010	I had also talked to Linda Robertson.
1010	Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.
1010	I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.
1010	Who else is going to run from the Republican side?
1010	I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.
1010	But I want to make sure we back the right one.
1011	one more to print
1012	What do you think?
1013	Thank you.
1013	I look forward to seeing you again in the interview process.
1014	I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).
1014	Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g.
1014	a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go.
1015	FYI and please handle.
1016	please schedule
1017	calendar
1018	I think you are right: most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.
1018	I doubt that a bus will make sense.
1019	I don't want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the O of C.
1020	I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.
1020	We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.
1020	I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for.
1020	I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.
1020	That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.
1020	Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.
1020	You should have a back-up plan.
1020	Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
1020	I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.
1021	I think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.
1021	More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything.
1022	This relates to the EPA region 9 issue we discussed last week
1023	Has Koenig seen the IR section?
1023	I don't agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors.
1023	I can't believe he would think that's accurate.
1024	Rick -- per my voicemail
1025	I don't think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed.
1025	I don't think they will and I think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take.
1025	Also, I want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don't slow down the "badge in" process.
1025	The other recommendations look fine to me.
1025	I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval.
1026	Thanks for the update.
1026	Your approach makes sense to me.
1027	FYI
1028	As we discussed
1029	Please see attached revised travel advisory.
1029	I think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests.
1030	No word yet.
1030	I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow.
1030	FYI, I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin.
1031	Per my voicemail.
1031	I'll be seeing Barton today in Austin and will make these points as well.
1032	Yes and yes
1033	I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday.
1033	The message they are stressing is that FERC is injecting much needed certainty.
1033	I think we should add that to our message as well.
1034	I would like to see him if it works on my schedule
1035	Per my voicemail
1036	calendar
1037	I think this is fine.
1037	It lends itself to an outline format, so I suggest converting to Word and make it a one-two page "leave behind".
1038	Thank you.
1038	I enjoyed our discussion very much.
1039	Thank you.
1039	I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.
1039	And yes I am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well.
1040	I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.
1040	I'm OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.
1040	we may not get much response now.
1040	We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference.
1041	Yes.
1041	Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing
1042	Thanks
1043	I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.
1043	The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).
1043	The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.
1043	First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company ...
1043	I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.
1043	Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond. Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes). Again, I think this is a very good communications piece. Nice work.
1044	Please print.
1045	Thank you.
1045	I also enjoyed our discussion very much.
1045	Your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive.
1045	You will be getting a call shortly, if you haven't already, inviting you to our weekend event later this month.
1045	Please come.
1046	I believe I sent this to you earlier.
1046	Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.
1046	He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.
1046	I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.
1046	Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?
1047	I have received my worldcom card
1048	We have already submitted our budget for PR, Govt' affairs, Facilities, corp HR etc. Does the process below affect my numbers (please say no).
1049	I will bring John BRindle.
1050	yes
1051	Thinking of you.
1052	Karen - please send a copy.
1053	A penetrating exposition of French culture.
1053	Useful prep for the girls' next French test.
1054	I'm meeting with Jerry Patterson today.
1054	He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.
1054	Jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that Ken has made a personal contribution.
1054	Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.
1054	Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution?
1055	Good update.
1055	Please put me on the distribution list for future installments.
1055	What about the net benefits test?
1055	Will the rate agreement suffice?
1055	call to discuss.
1056	I've talked to McConnell, Shankman and Reck and gave them my OK.
1057	I think this would be awkward given the large number of Business units
1058	Why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses.
1058	We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.
1058	We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.
1059	I'm not sure.
1059	A couple of theories: refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction; second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).
1059	In other news: Melissa's mom called last night.
1059	Francis is dying.
1059	He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.
1059	He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.
1059	He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.
1059	Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.
1059	He has stayed himself to the end: when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her: "I don't think we"ll be having sex today."
1060	Packet is on it's way by fed ex.
1060	Maureen will call the organizers.
1061	approved
1062	I sent the approval to JoAnn
1063	wanted to make sure you saw this
1064	I'm sure you are aware of this, but I am passing along just in case.
1065	please reply to Lucy.
1065	thanks
1066	We are setting up a process to respond directly to these and other comments, questions and concerns.
1066	Our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations.
1067	We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".
1067	This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.
1067	Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power.
1067	I like the "gerrymandering" message.
1067	A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.
1067	Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.
1068	here it is
1069	What do you know about this guy?
1070	I like your revised version.
1070	I have placed a call to Barton.
1070	In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.
1070	What do you think?
1071	I like the first opening paragraph better.
1071	Also, please don't use the term "corporate relations".
1071	I think "community relations" works fine and won't create as much confusion with public relations, corporate communications or other functions.
1071	thanks
1072	congratulations ...
1072	sorry to see you go.
1073	I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.
1073	Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we'll put it in front of derrick.
1074	she might ...
1074	might...
1074	be a fit in Billy Lemmons group.
1075	Thanks for your message.
1075	We met about the fire drill process yesterday and will have something shortly.
1075	One of the issues we are facing is the absence of "floor wardens" -- people who know the procedure and can help it move smoothly if there is a problem.
1075	If you are willing to volunteer, contact mike terraso.
1075	thanks
1076	third quarter qs and as
1077	Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind.
1077	(Enron Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).
1077	I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.
1078	Here is the most recent update I have.
1078	I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing.
1078	The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).
1078	Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.
1078	Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe.
1079	Absolutely ...
1079	Im sorry I saw this so late...
1079	we could have talked today.
1079	Let's talk Mon
1080	I assume you get these; if not, you should make sure you are on the list.
1081	See changes proposed to Q&A....
1081	still working.
1082	As discussed
1083	see attached
1084	revisions
1085	we will need to get new business cards
1086	See attahced
1087	thanks
1088	final
1089	looks good
1090	A very preliminary draft
1091	A very rough (off the top of my head) draft.
1092	Attached are some messages to consider using for the upcoming internal discussions.
1092	The document is not intended as a script but as a starting point for your remarks.
1093	See revised version
1094	Thanx 4 being so patient!!!
1094	Here' my story!!
1094	- Nora
1095	See attached with my comments.
1096	I didnt select them.
1097	thanks Anthony.
1097	It's difficult to see so many smart, hard working people in the kinds of circumstances you describe.
1097	Unfortunately, I'm going through some of the same things (on a smaller scale).
1097	We are having to let people go in my organization.
1097	I simply don't have room, even for a qualified person like Maurice.
1097	Does Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?
1097	If so, perhaps there is an opportunity there.
1098	Voicemail from Ken?
1099	Attached is a set of message points we developed with the finance group for use with our external audiences.
1100	[Kean, Steven J.] I'm copying Karen ...
1100	thanks for the heads up.
1100	My view is we probably won't want to expend resources or Ken's time on this right now.
1100	It looks like a story that can wait a bit.
1100	[Kean, Steven J.]
1101	I concur
1102	Please look into this
1103	here it is
1104	Please look into this and give Shelley a call back
1105	We can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else, but the money to Brown is out the door.
1105	I would still like to see the data.
1106	Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail.
1106	Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.
1106	We have too much to do right now.
1106	Assuming he agrees, let Misha know.
1107	Got your msg.
1107	Call me at 832.865.2445.
1108	Nice work.
1108	Thanks
1109	No, but thanks.
1110	Some additional background on the California refund issue.
1110	Consistent with what we discussed; just some additional detail.
1111	looks good
1112	Tracey prepared the attached to make sure we had the facts surrounding another related party (the Travel Agency in the Park).
1112	As you'll see from the attached use of the agency is encouraged (for sound business reasons) but is not mandatory
1113	I know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.
1113	I agree with John.
1113	There is little point showing this to Ken ...
1113	but you personally know him better, so I leave it to you.
1114	Thanks so much for the message.
1114	I am hanging in and hanging on, as is everyone else.
1114	I have never seen such courage and strength in an uncertain environment.
1114	Thanks for your offer..
1114	You hang in there too.
1115	Please make sure these individuals know that they have been designated.
1116	See below and look at attachment.
1116	In a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity.
1117	Here is a suggested Lay quote for the special committee release: "With the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital, which we are also announcing today, we are taking care of the past and securing the future."
1118	Thanks, Jeff.
1118	We have already retained a crisis PR firm --Kekst and Co. They have been working with us for the past few weeks.
1118	Feel free to mention them to Chase.
1119	Nice.
1120	Fine as written.
1121	Shankman told me tonight that the additional piece that makes up the difference between the 3.2 and the 4.4 has not been irreversibly committed to, so we don't have to pay.
1122	Thursday is fine.
1122	Please schedule.
1123	Thursday is fine.
1123	Let's talk about the proposed expenditures.
1123	We will need to prioritize.
1124	Thanks so much.
1124	As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.
1124	I will be in touch when the time comes.
1125	It's going to be postponed til Feb. I think you should attend when we have it.
1125	thanks
1126	Please see revisions.
1127	Jordan Mintz told me that the release needs to be reviewed one more time by securities lawyers.
1127	He will take care of it.
1128	here it is
1129	David would you please forward to the right person.
1130	Looks good.
1130	In the memo I wouldn't have ken refer to Dean Powers as "Bill" sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing.
1131	This is the final version agreed to by Citi and Chase.
1132	I think we should shoot for Tuesday (after the written info is released Mon).
1132	I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.
1132	Here's what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday's written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.
1132	I also think it needs to be a call not a webcast.
1132	What do you think?
1133	Would be happy to.
1133	Just let me know where.
1134	The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.
1134	Attached is an outline.
1134	Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the plan, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios.
1135	I don't think so.
1136	Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft.
1136	Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it.
1137	Some good news.
1137	Your call to Gov Rowland was helpful.
1137	We are not finished yet, but we are on our way.
1138	Thanks for thinking of us.
1138	We have retained a crisis communications firm -- Kekst &CO.
1138	-- to assist us.
1138	They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken.
1139	In case you need to reach someone in IR or PR, here are 24-hour numbers.
1140	Board meeting running long.
1141	Nice work, John.
1141	Please copy me and Ken on any recap you put together.
1142	The deal is final.
1142	Attached are some communication materials for you to use.
1143	please provide your thouhgts to Peggy
1144	If you'd like, I can set up a tour of the Enron Center for you and anyone else you'd like to include.
1145	I agree with Beth.
1145	We had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage, but the Dynegy option was the best.
1145	It's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down.
1146	This msg is about new bldg tour
1147	Anything further yet?
1148	Irwin is on Enron's advisory council.
1148	Could one of you send him a reply?
1149	Linda was assistant secy of US Treasury while this legislation was being negotiated.
1149	Let us know if we can help.
1150	Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown: Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.
1150	Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.
1150	African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
1150	Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.
1150	I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
1150	If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could: Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
1150	Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
1150	(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.) We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
1150	EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
1150	We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.
1150	We have said that we won't play on those terms.
1150	Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.
1151	Ken talked with Barton.
1151	Barton will not be signing the letter The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
1151	Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.
1151	Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
1151	I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).
1152	Thanks for the message.
1152	I don't know of anything moving forward as yet.
1153	I think the answer is this: fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.
1153	These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.
1153	The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently.
1153	That's what we are doing.
1154	Could you take a look at this?
1155	Thanks for the invite.
1155	We will probably still be on our way back from New Mexico (we're driving), so we won't be able to come.
1155	Have a good time ...
1155	I know you will.
1156	I hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.
1156	I understand that Ken and Chuck have spoken and that Greg, Stan, and Dave will be coming over at 3:00 and no one is expected to be there at 1:00.
1156	Correct?
1157	Thanks for the inquiry; I appreciate the interest very much.
1157	But I am not interested in participating.
1158	Please review and comment on the attached
1159	Please review for send out Monday.
1160	please call me re the attached
1161	See revised version attached.
1162	Melissa's mom will be coming, so we will be sticking around Hous.
1163	Absolutely.
1163	Send electronically, if possible.
1163	Thanks
1164	It asked me for login info.
1165	See minor comment and then circulate to the larger group.
1166	Ask everyone to send you the info to fill in the blanks (and to copy the others on the list).
1166	Perhaps you could join in on Oxley's 6:00 call...I'll ask by copy of this message.
1167	I'm sorry ...
1167	I told mom, Phil and Karen, but not you...
1167	Francis died two weeks ago.
1167	Norma is fine.
1167	She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas).
1168	Thanks for the information.
1168	It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill.
1168	Am I missing something?
1168	Do I have Enron stock I can sell to offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching? Other ideas?
1169	Michelle - can you respond?
1169	I haven't seen anything.
1169	Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).
1169	I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution.
1170	Attached are two versions of a press release.
1170	We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.
1170	The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).
1170	The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.
1170	Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).
1170	I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.
1171	As discussed.
1172	Please prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature.
1172	Please get me his phone number and get his fax number, so we can fax as well as mail the letter.
1173	I am terminating McLarty today.
1173	We can't terminate with Kissinger yet.
1173	I think we also need to terminate our agreement with Sue Walden.
1173	Do you have the agreement?
1174	If you are checking e-mail, show this to Nora.
1175	Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.
1175	Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week.
1176	Houston contact list
1177	I've sent some releases and other info to Mike B. Let me know if I need to resend.
1178	Here is the draft forwarded to Dynegy
1179	Any reason we couldn't do this?
1180	My comments
1181	I don't have any comments to add.
1182	Attached is the draft release.
1182	I didn't mean to come across too pessimistic on the way in this am.
1182	The release does contain good news and we need toget it out as soon as we can.
1183	This is an article that Irwin Stelzer wrote abut Enron.
1183	He is willing to talk further.
1183	His number is 202.777.3000.
1183	He said he would like to have me on the phone when you call.
1184	You should read this.
1184	You won't like some of the comparisons, but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished.
1185	thanks
1186	approved
1187	fyi ...
1187	anybody we can recommend?
1188	See me about this.
1189	Thank you so much for your message.
1189	And thanks for sharing that particular memory.
1189	It means alot to me.
1189	I have always enjoyed working with you.
1189	You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.
1189	It made me smile just to see you.
1189	You are an important part of "my Enron."
1189	I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.
1189	All the best.
1190	Here is the electronic copy.
1191	I wrote a letter of recommendation for you (you're getting it whether you want it or not).
1192	thanks so much for the note.
1192	I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.
1192	My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.
1192	I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I'll be glad when this one is over).
1193	Attached is my resignation from the PAC.
1194	In my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.
1194	Please review and approve John's.
1194	Please check on mine: they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.
1194	It may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once.

23	Will that work for you?
24	FYI
25	You are so good to me!
25	As long as we are together, it does not really matter where we stay.
25	I would prefer a king size bed as opposed to two double.
25	Although, if we mess up one, we can always use the other one.
25	The Lay Reviews are supposed to be over at 5:00, so any time after that.
25	I don't really have a preference on the return flight.
25	Love you
26	What do you think?
27	No PGG?
28	Thanks
29	We can probably do this.
29	However, if Steve Harris has not approved by then, I will not be able to send.
29	Why so early?
29	Why not first thing Friday?
30	Is this ok?

53	Please make sure he has any handouts ahead of time.
53	Thanks
54	Stan said last week that he would like to do a EGAS 2002 Capital Budget Review.
54	When do you think we can do this?
55	What do you think?
56	Cindy, Please ask Stan if he is okey with the attached agenda for the Lay 2002 Plan Reviews.
57	okey.
57	I already responded that I could not meet on Friday.
57	Since we will be out of the office, I will need the extra time.
58	If they can split by business unit they must have by company.
58	The FERC nor the partnerships will accept these charges unless we have the data to send the costs to them.
58	I really need something like yesterday.
58	I thought we had this resolved a long time ago.
59	Thanks
60	I love to make you happy.
60	I have been having hot flashes all afternoon!
60	I would really like for you to spoil me forever.
60	I love you, Tracy
61	I have attached examples from NNG presentation.
61	Lindy, you might want to use accountability slide format.

65	This is per Rod's instructions.
65	When we get the user list we will revise.
65	Thanks Tracy
66	I believe in 2001 it was $5.5.
66	Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002.
67	let me know if you have any comments as soon as possible.
67	thanks
68	What are these charges for?
69	approved for view only
70	This should go against the environmental reserve on 1N9.
70	Can you help her out?
71	I have attached the current estimate.
71	I am not sure it is right because I was confused on how they have been booking it.
71	I feel comfortable that the total year is right.
71	Its the line that totals $118 for the year.
72	Attached is the resume for the interview I set up on Thursday, Oct. 18.

145	But, Garret is very excited about staying with Jake.
145	Will that be ok?
146	Approved.
146	Please roll over November 1.
146	Please let me know if there is a problem.
147	see question #3
148	Do you want to coordinate with Lisa?
149	Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
149	EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc. This works better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
149	The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
149	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.
149	Please use the Arial font.
149	It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.
149	We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.
149	If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.
149	I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.
149	However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at 9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.
149	I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.
149	On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.
149	If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372.
150	EGAS (29.8) Includes tranfers in and out of other groups.
150	Do we need to go over this to make sure the other groups are adjusted appropriately?
150	Clean Fuels (21.1)
151	Stan only mentioned Rod and myself.
151	You might ask him before I ask anyone else.
151	Thanks
152	I will have Mary check into this when she gets back on Thursday.
152	I believe it should be part of the allocation.
153	We don't report this info separate.
153	I am afraid it will lead to alot more questions.
153	I would prefer system average.
153	Thanks
154	We should use previous quarter forecast.
155	I can't wait to see you tonight.
155	If you have alot of things to do at home, I don't mind driving to your house after Jackie's conference.
155	I have an Azurix 2002 Plan review from 2:30-4:30, so I will not be at your staff meeting.
155	I should be around until then.
155	Love you, Red
156	I have some errands I need to run at lunch.
156	I can pick my things up then.
156	About Las Vegas, I never received a confirm on Danny Gains last week.
156	I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.
156	Anything else you would like to see?
156	What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go?
157	I have spoken with Adam directly on this as well.
158	Can people dial in internationally with this number?
159	Qestion 3: 84% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD.
160	Yes, Adam Umanoff needs it I believe.
160	Why don't you contact his assistant Lorraine Telles.
161	Yes, we will go ahead with the meeting.
161	Actually, I will cancel for everyone else and Rod and I will meet with Stan for November and December.
161	Thanks Tracy
162	yes
163	Yes, I will be there.
164	Friday 2:00?
165	I should be able to make it at 1:30.

166	Thanks Tracy Geaccone
167	The O & M/G & A graph needs to be done in two graphs.
167	One for direct costs and one for Corporate costs.
167	This way you can better see the increase in the Corp costs.
167	Thanks Tracy
168	yes
169	I miss you too.

179	I don't know if we have the Trailblazer info in house.

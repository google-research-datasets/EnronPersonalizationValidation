0	Here is a kitty for your office.
0	I really miss mine now that they are in Kitty Jail!
1	I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.
1	Mum, only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in my work address for the other.
1	(Really missed the boat on tennis clothes. You have to act early. Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!) Karin, I am probably going to make a stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.
1	Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is That's all this elf knows.
1	* new trendy spelling with capital letter within the word
2	Janet, please calendar these meetings for me.
2	Thanks.
3	Bryan, Are you still having a great time?
3	So what is Bali like?
3	The only images I can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?
3	Things are pretty good here.
3	Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas cheer, etc. Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.
3	Really, though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.
3	Take care.
4	John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.
4	My understanding is that physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will simply be a paper transfer.
4	Since a contract is required in our system as a formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the transfer is $0.
4	This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with the above scenario.
4	If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call me (x30596).
5	Hey girl!
5	Thanks for the book and the CD.
5	I lazed around the house enjoying both yesterday morning.
5	After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).
5	So it was a good birthday.
5	Have a good day!
6	See the attached (one shows redlining, the other does not) and let me know if you have further questions.
7	no comments this month
8	Thanks.
8	Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you.
9	I made a couple of minor changes.
9	Here are plain and redlined versions (I turned the tracker off on the plain one).
9	Also, be sure to fill in the contract #.
10	Did Stan make the call to FERC, I wonder.
11	Drew -- see MK's comments.
11	I'm trying to come up with some new language to address her concerns.
12	Oops, wrong one -- I meant MK had comments on Red Cedar.
12	This one for Duke is OK.
13	Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a nonconforming agreement filed by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to do, if I understand the concept of volumetric rates correctly.
13	Left a message for my friend at DMP but he (like everyone else) is out 'til next year.
13	But since there were no subsequent orders issued in the docket I assume there were no problems with the filing.
13	I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file as nego.
13	rate approach.
13	If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I will draft something and send it your way.
13	The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service under DMP's Rate Schedule FTS.
13	Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement specifies that KGS will pay a volumetric rate.
13	The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible transportation service rate as set forth in DMP's tariff.
13	.
13	.The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as KGS' maximum daily reservation quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) identifies five primary delivery points for KGS.
13	.
13	.
13	Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to the above negotiated rate so that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm rate schedule.
14	Drew, I've attached my proposed changes to the Red Cedar contract.
14	Our beloved Min/Max Language became a bit problematic, as you can see.
14	I'd welcome your comments on this.
15	see attached.
16	Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!
16	My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!
16	Everyone tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.
16	Example: over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds of delivery-room horror stories!
16	I finally had to yell at her to get her to shut up.
16	Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a message.
16	Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.
16	Hope your holiday was really great!
17	Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec.
17	1 exemption for gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).
17	He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.
17	I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.
17	Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway!
17	Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.
17	At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.
17	If anything interesting happens I'll let you know.
18	Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend to a dinner party given by some people she doesn't even know.
18	Although I am trying very hard to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.
18	When I was in her situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had a date or not!
18	But that's just me.
18	Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.
18	We certainly are here.
18	If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!
18	(You will still have to wear sunscreen).
18	What are your trip dates again?
18	Have a good day!
18	Love,
19	I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.
19	I have a call in to Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you in that loop in case you get any inquiries.
19	(My initial, unofficial reaction is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no difference to the FERC.) Until further notice, I would avoid any communication with ENA on these issues.
19	If you have any questions, please e-mail or call me (x30596).
20	Attached is Shelley Corman's response to Jeff Dasovich, based on conversations with Drew and me.
20	Accordingly, I would advise you not to participate in the conference call Jeff is setting up for tomorrow.
20	Questions -- give me a call.
21	Steve, for your information, the case in which the Commission denied ECT's petition for a limited waiver of the shipper must have title rule appears at 84 FERC P 61,222.
22	Hi Mum!
22	Ann and I saw "Mr. Ripley" and I lay awake last night wondering how else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!
22	I think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid this blurring of film and reality.
22	My tendency is to really get involved when I see them on the big screen!
22	Might be going to San Francisco next week.
22	I'd really like to go.
22	We'll see.
22	Probably I will come to Austin on Saturday but I've not heard from the landscaper yet.
22	I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.
22	Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today.
22	Love,
23	Our consulting agreement with IGS for services related to the CPUC proceeding expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.
23	Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner rather than later...let me know and I'll draft a brief letter to Mark Baldwin.
24	I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request.
24	It expires 2/29/00.
24	The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate us to agree to any such extension.
24	As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide any other information you need for the meeting.
25	Lindy, do you know offhand whether our OBAs with PG&E and SoCal deviate from the usual 10% tolerance provided for in our tariff form OBA?
25	If not, who do you think might be able to tell me?
26	Rich, would you please add Tim Aron to your distribution list for the Gallup Weekly Updates, and also forward him your latest?
26	He is working on New Mexico regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression contract, and I thought your updates would help keep him in the loop.
26	Thank you.
27	The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th - 29th.
27	See the website www.spahouston.org and click on "Program Notes" for a detailed description.
27	Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage.
27	I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but it should not be a problem if we go early enough.
27	The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird!
27	Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.
27	We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!
27	Have a good day!
28	Lorraine, here is the new language for the discount letter.
28	You might want to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to make sure I got the right version (or I'll do it on Monday).
28	Let me know if you have questions.
28	I just ran it by Drew and he is OK with it.
29	OK, here's my first attempt.
29	Although I think Red Cedar's lawyers might be looking for more, they have not specifically requested it, so I decided to stick to making only the statements Ed Meaders mentioned in his 2 voice mails.
29	I believe this may suffice.
30	Mary Kay -- please see the attached -- Red Cedar has essentially asked us for acknowledgement that TW is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport gas for producers even though Red Cedar itself does not have title to the gas.
30	Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.
31	Drew, here is the memo.
31	I know you will add your own spin before sending it on to Cordes.
31	However, if there is anything you want me to fix, please do not hesitate to call.
32	Jeff, attached is our summary of the Transwestern receipt point proposal for inclusion in CAC's settlement proposal.
32	I hope that this is helpful.
32	If you have any comments, please let me know.
33	Lorraine, here is the letter.
33	You will need to fill in the address; otherwise it's ready to go.
33	Let me know if you need anything else (including
34	Janet -- could you please try to find the files Maria references in her e-mail, and I'll take it from there.
34	Thanks!
35	Please print out the attached on my letterhead & bring it over to me.
35	Thank you!!
36	I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.
36	He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.
36	However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.
36	He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.
36	Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.
36	He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.
36	Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.
36	That could be good, or it could be bad.
36	Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.
36	At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers.
37	Janet, can you open the attachment?
38	I just rely on the market services folks to do the right thing.
38	Tell me if you think this is yet another area in which I have too much faith in our business people.
39	Lorraine, please forward the attached to Ed Meaders.
40	I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing?
41	Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.
41	Your written comments would be appreciated.
42	Christine, you need a comma between July and August.
42	Otherwise this looks fine.
43	Please see the attached.
44	Hey K!
44	Thanks for the note.
44	Everyone is asking how you're doing.
44	Sorry to hear about your back; I know what it is like.
44	As much as you are inclined to run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my back problem was just to recline as much as possible!
44	My house truly became a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.
44	I really like your monosyllabic choices for names: Kyle and Quinn.
44	For some reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.
44	Perhaps because it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.
44	I think you really have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.
44	Who knows, she might turn out to be more of a Gladys!
44	heh, heh!
44	The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.
44	It looks really good.
44	I even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.
44	The last thing is to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel sitting in the back yard!
44	Time to work.
44	Try to take it easy!
45	On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.
45	The Commission's order contained two conditions: 1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.
45	Transwestern accepted the certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.
45	On January 18, 2000, Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.
45	Transwestern has already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.
45	Transwestern intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure through a discount report.
46	Lorraine, see the attached.
46	I added "Maximum" and "Minimum" to the chart but don't know whether I got it backwards...anyway, let's talk if you have any questions.
47	Hi Mum!
47	Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project yesterday.
47	I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.
47	Guess who helped me?
47	Bill!
47	He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.
47	So we were able to knock it out in about 3 hours.
47	There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.
47	Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some repair/caulking/spackling.
47	Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably will not get to it until next month.
47	Maybe you will be able to help me decide on a color when you are here this weekend.
47	I'm torn between "Happy Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.
47	If I decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to the professionals.
47	Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.
47	Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy dance, I invited him.
47	So that leaves us with one ticket.
47	If you would like to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around here will join us.
47	Hope your weekend project was a success.
47	Talk to you soon!
47	Love,
48	The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).
48	I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.
48	However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).
48	Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.
48	However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.
48	If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.
48	Comments?
49	Brian and Glen, Based upon a review of the 1/21/00 draft of Motion for Extension of Procedural Schedule, Transwestern Pipeline Company does not wish to join as a party to the motion, and does not plan to oppose the motion.
49	Sincerely, Susan Scott
50	The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in redlining.
50	I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.
50	Many of my changes are simply to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined terms).
50	In a couple of places, I have questions: 1) In the second opening paragraph, I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if not, ignore my change.
50	2) Section 4.a.
50	-- their provision for an adjustment seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so I left it in. If you don't like it, let me know.
50	3) In Section 5, I just tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.
50	Let me know if this does not agree with your intent.
50	Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to proceed.
51	That is weird.
51	I received your first message.
51	Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor Facilities.
51	Do you have this?
51	Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.
51	Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.
51	Thank you!
52	Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.
52	They said they would mull it over, at least.
52	But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would get the contract rate no matter what.
52	Since this would make it a negotiated rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree to it.
52	Steve has already told me it is OK with him.
52	Please advise.
53	Here's the summary we sent you before, with new reference to Hector in redlining.
53	Call Jeff (713-853-1521) or me (713-853-0596) if you have questions.
54	Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.
54	This language is very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates issue.
54	I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.
54	Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.
54	It is important that we work something out with Phillips today.
54	By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language (i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in exchange for us making this compromise.
54	She feels that it would be inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).
55	Dear Citizens' Assistance Division: I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.
55	For the 3 years I've lived there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on my street, have been blocked.
55	Any time it rains, we have standing water for several days afterwards.
55	I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.
55	I have heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper crop of mosquitos this summer.
55	Standing water therefore poses a health concern for residents of the Heights this summer.
55	Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the Heights?
55	Last year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, but got no response.
55	I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication that the City of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens.
55	Any information you can provide would be appreciated.
55	Sincerely, Susan Scott (713) 853-0596 (daytime phone)
56	Dear Mr. Henderson: Attached pursuant to Dave Foti's request is the Substation Maintenance Agreement in Word format with Transwestern's proposed changes shown in redlining.
56	After you've had a chance to review the agreement, please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
56	Sincerely, Susan Scott Counsel for Transwestern Pipeline Company
57	Drew, what is BNSF?
58	Spoke with Steve about the swap question.
58	He wants to talk with you about this before circling back to Knippa.
58	If you don't hear from him, and want to call him, his # is 281-350-8441.
58	Re.
58	TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early: If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.
58	No other specific damages are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.
58	(Section 9.2 provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.) The Gas Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.
58	Other questions -- let me know.
59	If there's still space available, please enroll me in the March 14-15 Derivatives I class.
59	Here's my info: Susan Scott GPG Legal Supervisor: Drew Fossum SSN ********* Thanks.
60	Here's my request for rehearing so far.
60	The marketing folks are helping me with our competitive harm argument and will, I hope, come up with something plausible.
60	In the meantime, I would appreciate your comments.
61	Approved.
62	Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist.
62	There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market services, weren't there?
62	One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language is already general enough to cover us there.
62	The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in the last cycle.
62	I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.
62	The tariff language as it's currently written says we "shall" issue an OFO, and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
62	If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there are any other issues we need to address, let me know.
62	Also, if you want to sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later this afternoon, I'm available.
62	Thanks!
63	My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.
63	The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here: Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted.
63	Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential.
63	Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive.
63	On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public.
63	Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities.
63	[FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services.
63	Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public.
63	FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events.
63	In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not: the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements.
63	In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power.
63	Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements.
63	There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases.
63	Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything.
64	Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.
64	Please let me know your comments by C.O.B.
64	tomorrow.
64	At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission.
64	I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.
64	Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.
64	I do not expect the agreement to change significantly.
65	Steve and Frank, I would be very interested in your comments on the attached.
66	Here's what I propose to send to the parties on the 14th.
66	Take a look, and think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first paragraph.
66	I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so that we have some time to approach individual parties first.
66	With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also.
67	The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar quarter.
67	Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug. Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.
67	I am also not completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety rule.
67	(In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure notice.) If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions.
67	In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law.
67	I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction.
67	I recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.
67	Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.
68	Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences.
68	Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document.
68	Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the SoCalGas system.
68	Not only does the proposal satisfy the Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation.
68	CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's system.
68	Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the CAC document.
68	To this end, Transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.
68	Transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.
68	Susan Scott Senior Counsel Transwestern Pipeline Company
69	Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a filing.
69	I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher customer (don't know why I would think that...).
69	My suggestion is that we work through Ms. Katz initially.
69	Anticipating that we might encounter some inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept.
69	-- and to give you an outline to work from when talking to Stefanie -- I put together the attached rough draft of a motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Sempra.
69	Feel free to send the attached to Stefanie.
69	However, please do so with the caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal advice to Sempra from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.
69	Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.
70	Can we keep the upside -- I believe the answer is clearly "no" unless/until we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing.
70	Til then we're bound by the billing provisions on Sheet 95H.
70	Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting out there a while...
70	As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt.
70	points.
70	If we don't, and the replacement shipper uses an alt.
70	point and has to pay max rate, releasing shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.
70	I know Lindy has some clear ideas on what we want here...
70	we can discuss more if you like.
71	I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.
71	However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.
71	First, does "voluntary" mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?
71	Or is the Commission here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with auctions?
71	Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is from the order.
71	A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.
71	Comments?
72	I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked your question yesterday.
72	"IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some refund mechanism.
72	Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.
72	If you need more info, let's talk.
73	In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.
73	This Friday at 6:30 p.m.
73	Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at Jones Hall.
73	All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a piece.
73	My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.
73	Bear in mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one of you.
73	While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one evening.
73	Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such an outing.
73	"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years."

74	Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc. The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of $0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.
74	Using a discount factor of 15%, the net present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be $188,118.75.
74	Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated (I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the project.
74	We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for this type of project, if that's possible to determine.
74	I have a call in to James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know what he says.
75	(I'll review this after my 9:00 meeting -- thought you might want a copy also.)
76	Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction mechanism (RRM).
76	Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold.
76	(The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.) The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month.
76	This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed it.
76	FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly discriminatory.
76	The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal.
76	gas transportation market -- the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available.
76	I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.
76	We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept it.
76	That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).
77	After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they all used to be?
77	I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email could have.
77	They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.
77	I really don't know what to say about the email.
77	If I didn't know what happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just confused.
77	I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send it to him in a heartbeat.
77	But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.
77	I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email dialogue throughout the day.
78	Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component (using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.
78	Does that make sense to you?
79	I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "TW defers to the consensus position of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.
79	Could we just not say anything on those items?
79	Or say TW has no comment at this time.
79	Would the other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?
80	Pursuant to your request, attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your non-Gallup customers if you like.
80	If you do so, please inform them that we are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example, and whether they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments.
81	As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.
81	In the context of the Gallup Expansion, Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to Topock.
81	Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point: 40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present.
81	Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG&E/Topock.
81	The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper.
81	More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper.
81	In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered.
81	In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days.
81	The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide service under an FTS-1 contract.
81	A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations.
81	Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action.
81	Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points.
81	Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.
81	I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages.
81	Can we meet briefly to discuss this?
81	I'm available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a meeting time for next week.
81	Thank you.
82	Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.
82	With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable leeway here.
82	The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate (or primary) points.
82	Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.
82	(Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).
82	On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal rates) provisions of the order.
82	In other words, I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service.
82	As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.
82	I realize the order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1.
82	Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized presentation to persons outside the company.
82	The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.
82	In the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer them.
83	See my changes on the attached.
84	Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.
84	She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.
84	Please let me know if you have any comments in this regard.
84	One caveat: the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the conf.
84	if El Paso does not want TW represented there.
84	ENA will probably be sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some intelligence from them.
85	Thanks, Maria, this is very helpful.
85	I'm planning on drafting something this week for everyone's review.
85	Don't know if any other pipelines have tried to do anything similar but I'll find out.
86	Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel rather than providing fuel in kind.
86	If you want the attachments (examples of other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.
86	Comments?
86	Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?
87	Hi Lindy.
87	Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before inviting people.
87	First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were: - imbalance netting & trading - mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators - hourly determination of imbalances Is this correct?
87	Next, the list of attendees: you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila Nacey (or someone else she designates).
87	Anyone else?
87	As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and I'll get it set up.
88	With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to ROFR.
88	The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts.
88	The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.
88	In limiting the right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate.
88	Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract.
88	In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.
88	Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" basis).
88	Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract.
89	Lorraine: here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my comments.
89	Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects.
89	1.
89	Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity.
89	- I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers.
89	- Net costs will be separately recorded.
89	2.
89	Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services?
89	(I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the "no tying" part).
89	3.
89	Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?
89	- No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity.
89	4.
89	Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?
89	- No. PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal.
89	- Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW.
89	5.
89	How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing open access operations?
89	- TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with TW's mainline.
89	Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's tariff.
89	- The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW's system.
89	- Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be able to acquire on an as-needed basis?
89	Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff?
89	Which would come first, our deal with PNM or with our shipper?
89	It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios.
89	6.
89	Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities?
89	- Yes.
89	Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral.
89	Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.
89	Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system.
89	It would enable TW to transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral.
89	The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.
89	Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.
90	Something to keep in mind: Since FERC has implied that it considers shipper support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other pipelines, the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing, the better.
91	Here are my comments, spice girl.
92	The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.
92	This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.
92	The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).
92	Steve Harris wants to be able to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."
92	In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.
92	I see no problem with this, do you?
92	(Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.)

96	Hi!
96	Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.
96	Sorry Grayson is being a crybaby.
96	It is tough being a baby, I think.
96	How did the doctor's app't go?
96	Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.
96	Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave.
96	I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone.
96	Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!
96	Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.
96	Even the handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several days a week, for sanity's sake.
96	Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.
96	I get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good.
96	I always enjoy meeting her for lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.
96	Thank God she can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.
96	Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."
96	It was a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.
96	I thought it would be funnier but it was actually pretty dark.
96	The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.
96	Despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.
96	Diverse Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.
96	(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.) They mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.
96	A lot of it is really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.
96	One of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been hanging out there to see whether I like the people.
96	Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.
96	Time to read more FERC cases.
96	I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the drum all day.
96	Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!
96	Love, Susan
97	Thanks Dennis.
97	Do you have the form of discount letter too?
97	If so, please send it.
98	The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from day to day.
98	The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and each consecutive one-day term (if any).
98	The term of the discount letter is typically one month or 3 months.
98	The discount letter does not obligate TW to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.
98	My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 months.
98	If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it.
98	Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it last December.
99	Part II: FERC Writing Handbook 1.
99	"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your pleadings.
99	In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.
99	2.
99	Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.
99	With few exceptions, parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of the party will appear several times in one sentence.
99	3.
99	The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."
99	Example: "Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."
99	4.
99	"In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or "concerning."
99	5.
99	If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for emphasis.
99	Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the provision once.
99	6.
99	Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading before stating the purpose of your pleading.
99	No FERC staffer ever remembers what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

102	Jeff, here are Colleen's comments.
102	At your convenience, let's meet to discuss.
103	Attached for your information is a summary of other parties' requests for rehearing of Order 637.
103	I will be happy to answer any questions you might have.
104	Aurora, my changes appear on the attached.
104	I assume you or AA have updated the numbers for eligible transition costs (second paragraph of section 7).
104	(If you have not, I'm really not sure who would have those numbers) I updated the numbers for environmental costs in the footnotes.
104	Please call (x30596) if you have any questions.
105	The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.
105	The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.
105	Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.
105	The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.
105	I see no basis for this limitation.
105	The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.
105	The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.
105	If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.
105	The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.
105	We are not guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.
105	The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
105	Does this make sense?
105	I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.
105	Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board.
105	Thanks.
106	Jeff, here it is.
106	Take a look and if you have any questions, I'll be prepared to address them promptly so you can send this off.
107	Also, I would add that another reason we didn't submit the O&M agreement is that we considered it to be confidential.
108	Joel, you can remove my name from the distribution list as I am no longer working in the controls group.
108	I have moved over to gas trading and am supporting one of the traders.
108	It's been great working with you and I'll be sure to say hi when I visit London this fall.
108	Cheers.
109	Jason, you can go ahead and remove my name from the email distribution list as I am no longer working in the controls group.
109	I've enjoyed working with you and will definitely pay you all a visit when I travel to London this fall.
109	Cheers.
110	Hugo, you can go ahead and remove me from the distribution list as I have moved out of the controls group.
110	Good luck with everything, it has been great working with you.
111	Main Entry: al?tru?ism Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter Date: 1853 1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others We got to talking about you at lunch today. Rudy mentioned that in effort to get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him by consuming so much of his time requesting reports. My understanding is that your typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."
111	I am sure you recognize the hypocrisy laden in this statement. If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not care if his acts are recognized or not. In fact, the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed. We may have to downgrade you to "concerned individual". But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. If you haven't seen the film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, extremely unselfish young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C. The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of the Century list, and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List.. FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply haven't sent one out in the past two weeks. I will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition. I must say I was tempted to remove you given your complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of appearances.
112	Do you honestly think Tobin can be a substitute for you?
113	Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be back in the world of reachable individuals next week.
113	I'm glad you appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.
113	I was afraid after two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that last email would have probably been the final nail in the coffin.
113	As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.
113	Turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.
113	Even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all I can about his book.
113	Hopefully, after I get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.
113	You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).
113	I hope things are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.
113	If that is the case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life.
113	Believe me over the last two months I have had ample opportunity to do just that.
113	Just let me know if I can return the favour you once did for me.
113	Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.
113	P.S.
113	How was Canada?
113	I heard through the grapevine you went the other weekend.
114	No wanting to incur the wrath of Jen for failing to keep you informed.
114	Monte Montgomery will be playing at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge May 6.
114	Hopefully, we can make this one.
115	Jen, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.
115	I spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.
115	I'm pretty sure the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on that.
115	I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.
115	And, Emily, Katy and myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.
115	We met the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.
115	It renewed my faith in the opposite sex.
116	Okay, that was really good.
117	...because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit people like me.
118	Dart, you can take me off the email distribution list now that I've left the risk controls group.
118	Thanks.
119	The views expressed below are not those of Enron Corp. or any of it's subsidiaries.
120	It was not meant as an implication, but rather a reiteration of mind-sets expressed to me on multiple occasions.
120	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
121	It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly and enthusiastically.
121	(Tobin, you should watch how quickly you respond.)
122	Yes, it was.
123	Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?
123	You know me well enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly enjoyed the preceding banter.
123	Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I am a lady.
123	(I have a bad habit of forgetting.)
124	You can take me off of the email distribution for FX exposures also.
124	Thanks.
125	Our answer is simple: It is not our policy to release such information unless we are required to do so by law, regulation or order.
126	Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).
126	For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game congratulations and you suck.
126	For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).
126	I realize the mass email has been MIA the last two weeks.
126	For some this may have been a welcomed relief.
126	For others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the distribution.
126	At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but it is undergoing an audit.
126	Should it be determined that it is necessary to remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be notified and given an explanation.
126	If anyone would like to know the causes for expulsion you can write to: I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.
126	On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.
127	Aren't we a poor sport.
128	Sorry I've been MIA this week...new job and all.
128	Thought you might get a kick out of this email.
128	It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40.
128	And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his).
128	Yes I will be attending the Taster's dinner this evening.
128	Look forward to seeing you there.
129	You're off.
130	You try and do something nice, keep people informed and involved and it just gets thrown back in your face.
130	That's okay though because, "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit people like me."
131	You must have too much time on your hands.
131	The situation has been corrected.
132	Hey, just wondering how your weekend of golf went.
132	Wouldn't want to be accused of cutting off contact again.
132	P.S.
132	-- I got a very interesting response from Plauche following the mass email...he is definitely a different chap.
133	The scary thing is I don't think he was kidding.
134	Here is a list of all the agreements related to the Gallup Compressor: 1.
134	Compression Services Agreement (10/18/99) 3.
134	Gas Conversion Agreement (10/18/99) 4.
134	Operational Control Agreement (2/11/00) (contains no provisions related to payment) 5.
134	Letter amendment to Gas Conversion Agreement (2/23/00) (regarding Lock Price) 6.
134	Amendment to Gas Conversion Agreement (3/24/00) (regarding Start Date and calculation of Estimated CSC Fuel Payment) If you do not have all of these agreements in your file, or if you know of anyone else who needs a full set of these documents, please let me know and I will send copies immediately.
134	Also, two letters have been sent pursuant to the terms of the agreements: 1.
134	Notification by TW to ECS that ECS should pursue an alternative electric supply arrangement (2/29/00) 2.
134	Approval by TW of interim rate schedule (3/15/00) (w/copy of rate schedule attached) If you need copies of these letters, let me know and I'll send them to you also.
135	You crack me up.
135	I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce Cockburn concert.
135	I am definitely interested.
135	Don't know what I'm doing this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.
135	Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how much.
135	I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check it out.
135	Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless Knights?
135	Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.
135	Sorry so short with the email.
135	Even though they may be short I should be able to email throughout the day.
136	Hi Mum!
136	No, tickets were hard to come by.
136	Tried to get some they released a couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries and interns downstairs to hold places in line!
136	I'm sure the VPs will get tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away.
136	Tonight is the big CAM gala.
136	Bill was in trial all week and had no time to go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).
136	Andre is a couple of inches shorter than Bill.
136	Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that Bill is my date.
136	My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.
136	It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and the rest is very heavy pink satin.
136	Since it wraps in the back I was able to move the hooks over to get it to fit.
136	Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get it hemmed!
136	Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.
136	Too bad the party is not on a Saturday.
136	Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.
136	What are you doing the weekend of the 16th?
136	Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that weekend.
136	If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri.
136	or Sat.
136	a.m. Let me know.
136	Our law conference begins Thurs.
136	a.m. in San Antonio.
136	Dot (Staci's boss) is having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.
136	We really do have a fun group; it should be a good time.
136	If K&J want company I'll drive over to see them on Thurs.
136	night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big drag last year.
136	I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans are.
136	Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.
136	Keep your fingers crossed!
136	Love,
137	The two new pub codes that need to be addded to TAGG are: Thanks.
138	See the attached.
138	Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.
138	I recommend TW do the same.
138	I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet.
138	(I propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.) If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.
138	Let me know what you think.
139	The Pub code has been changed to IF-ELPO/SJ.
139	Sorry for the mix-up.
140	Brian: Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the following footnote: Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary and secondary rights described on Appendix A. Transwestern does not oppose the other parts of the settlement.
140	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
141	Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.
141	My recommendation is that we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.
141	To that end, it's time to review some basics.
141	In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated: "We see reason to pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the short term. If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about it in the next phase of the proceeding. In addition, we seek specific proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined."
141	Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain: 1.
141	The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road were established as a formal receipt point 2.
141	Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing primary and secondary receipt points 3.
141	Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that works) I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief after testimony has been filed.
141	Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.
141	I think the best thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to say what.
141	I'm available after about 2:00 today.
142	Not at all!
142	Fawcett's the antsy one; he is anxious to use his new honorary law degree (ahem!).
142	I agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a settlement when the agreement has yet to be written.
142	It would be like giving SoCal a signed blank check (that's carte blancheto us lawyers), and we don't trust them that much.
142	Once we've signed a real agreement, I do want to file something in support.
142	I'm just trying to plan ahead, is all.
143	Aurora, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we will have to do as far as containment of PCBs this year is the subject of some dispute.
143	I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible.
144	Do we have an estimate of PCB decontamination costs for 2000?
144	AA is asking...
145	Here is the breakdown of 1999 PCB decontamination costs for TW: Remove PG&E filter separator $ 10,000 If you need the costs broken down in more detail, or need more information, please give me a call at x30596.
146	"In an age when cloying, dumbed-down Internet "chat" threatens to reduce discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual Fridays, men's-room vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its Pine Sol perimeter, infecting what is left of conversational civility. Well-articulated sublimation--which has produced some damned fine (and sexy) art, music, and literature over the millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression. That ageless Hot Boy, Michelangelo's David, could only have been produced through deft restraint. But try telling that to some WWF instant Adonis with a protein-supplement habit."
146	--Gerri Hirshey
147	Are you experiencing some sort of split personality today?
147	Should I start referring to you as Ben or MaximMan depending on your responses?
148	I am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as MaximMan.
148	While I realize you are a fan of the magazine, professing so too loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies (some of us do have a shread of dignity, which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away).
148	My advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most "handy".
149	It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified what constitutes a "good" girl.
149	And, given that oversight I may have been remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.
149	Just as the opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may not be in line.
149	P.S.
149	-- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.
149	(We really should have figured that one out last night.)
150	Wilson, I treasure your NY attitude.
150	I think part of the reason you find so few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced either.
150	I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more lenient some more stringent.
150	At least that has been my experience.
151	The Word of the Day for April 6 is: 1 a : the food of the Greek and Roman gods b : the ointme or perfume of the gods *2 : something extremely pleasing to taste or smell 3 : a dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut Example sentence: "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and n the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as wesatisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied."
151	(Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre) Did you know?
151	"Ambrosia" literally means "immortality" in Greek; it is a derivative of the Greek word "ambrotos," meaning "immorta which combines the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") with (meaning "mortal"). In Greek and Roman mythology, only immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia. Th mythological gods and goddesses also drank "nectar," whicin its original sense, refers to the "drink of the gods."
151	(Even today, you'll often find the words "ambrosia" and "nectar" in ea other's company.) While the "ambrosia" of the gods prevented death, we mere mortals use "ambrosia" in reference to thi that just taste or smell especially delicious.
152	Just wanted to let you know that the Richardson deal has been entered into TAGG.
152	The deal number is NE2760.
153	I think I had too much nectar last night.
154	Richard, you can remove my name from the distribution list as I have rotated to a new group and am no longer working in the controls group.
154	Thank you.
155	Please don't think less of me as a person, but this really made me laugh.
156	The Word of the Day for April 7 is: : the use of archaisms (as in a historical novel) Example sentence: "Get rid of the gadzookery," Bruce's editor cautioned.
156	"Mirabella can perfectly well say 'please' instead of Did you know? "Gadzooks .
156	.
156	.
156	you astonish me!"
156	cries Mr. Lenville inCharles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby. We won't accuse Dickens of gadzookery ("the bane of historical fiction," as historicnovelist John Vernon called it in Newsday magazine), because we assume people actually said "gadzooks" back in the 1830s. That mild oath is an old-fashioned euphemism, so it is thought, for "God's hooks" (a reference, supposedly, to the nails of the Crucifixion). But it's a fine line today's historical novelist must toe, avoiding expressions like "zounds" and "pshaw" and"tush" ("tushery" is a synonym of the newer "gadzookery," whichfirst cropped up in the 1950s), as well as "gadzooks," while atthe same time rejecting modern expressions such as "okay" and "nice."
157	For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.
157	The three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.
157	I think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the PHC.
158	I hated to e-mail all of you but I honestly do not know how to handle the attached which was forwarded to me, and thought one of you might.
158	Any clues...please advise.
158	Thanks.
159	Shelley -- I'm going to the game but should be back in the office after 5 pm today if you want to chat.
159	x30596.
160	As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.
160	If that is not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level of intelligence I had previously afforded you.
160	However, as I hate having my illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just give you the number...ext.
160	31455.
161	I possesed many of the items featured in this email, but my favorite by far was the one featured in the final frame.
161	I was a super-hero in the universe other wise known as my backyard.
162	Drew, I'll fax you the information on the "Be a Spokesmodel...or Just Look Like One" course they offer here in the Houston office.
163	Mark, Thanks for still including me in the distribution, it makes me feel important.
163	However, as I have moved out of the controls group it probably isn't necessary to include me any longer.
164	First and foremost you are a father, then a husband and then a poet.
165	The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified with it's message.
165	Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he does believe in a power higher than himself.
165	As for myself...
165	I am still measuring my powers.
165	They seem to lie in such varied arenas that I never know what I will discover day-to-day.
165	As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the first bite is the sweetest.
165	And I must say I look forward with great anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.
165	My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope for more).
165	* I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.
165	Given all of this I am very happy.
166	Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.
166	I think the first order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.
166	Depending on everyone's preferences I have several suggestions.
166	Let me know your thoughts (regarding tonight).
167	Is there actually a fun sushi place?
167	And do they have Ichiban beer?
168	With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want to go somewhere we can eat?).
168	Given that the three of you sit within inches of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me.
168	Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.
168	If you get stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions.
169	Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little Woodrow's tonight.
169	I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as early as possible.
169	Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen.
170	Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.
170	Thus, our evening out is on.
170	See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.
170	If you can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.
170	Besides, most of you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.
170	Cheers.
171	Wilson, my most heartfelt apologies.
171	I failed to include you on the last email (huge oversite on my part).
172	Sorry, I forgot to include you in the last email.
172	Hope to see you tonight.
173	Interesting.
173	I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the surviving spouse.
173	Any community property issues between Greg and ex should have been settled in the divorce proceedings.
173	But it's been a while since I looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.
173	In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.
173	If, God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!
173	Bill doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will for cheap.
174	Just wanted to share this thought with all of you.
174	- The Paradox of Our Time.doc It is because of nights like last night with company such as yours that I remain optimistic in the face of statements such as the one attached.

176	Not quite as enlightening as the last email, but much funnier.
177	That was amazing.
178	FYI: This morning, Lorraine and I checked with PNM and surprisingly they do not offer any kind of IT transportation service, just firm service.
178	So our final revisions to the cover letter do not include acquiring interruptible service from PNM, since it's impossible to do so.
179	I literally had tears in my eyes reading this one.
179	It sounded like a possible Santamaria outing.

180	Please include me on the volunteer e-mail list.
181	Hi there!
181	How's the little buglet doing?
181	It was good to see you last week, and I feel honored that I got to accompany Grayson on her first restaurant mission.
181	Hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding schedule to badly.
181	Got a message from Mema wanting to discuss the baby's bottle habits.
181	Pu-lease!
181	If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill at Easter as a distraction.
181	This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends (aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150.
181	I'll be driving someone's SUV.
181	If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home.
181	Do you remember Rob Carty from high school?
181	I just saw him at a seminar given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers.
181	He works for Exxon/Mobil now.
181	I barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!
181	Thought you would enjoy the following brief excerpt from today's Wall Street Journal: Big Boy's Adventures in Thailand With his checkered overalls, cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers, Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok.
181	"People thought he was a little, well, creepy," says Peter Smythe, the head franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare.
181	"They kept asking me, 'Is he a Chinese Ronald McDonald?'" Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet.
181	Take care and drop me a line when you can.
181	Love,
182	So Burton hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish. Supposedly you were slamming them back last night."
182	When I asked where he garnered such information he told me "From our friend on 28."
182	I promptly sent the following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with that I drink like a fish?"
182	Result, no response to me but he called Burton to lambast him for ratting him out.
182	And the eternal question remains, if no longer interested why care so much?
183	I'm a man trapped in a woman's body...
183	not really, this is Jeff Fawcett in Susan's office.
183	We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking about the settlement document.
183	Would you guys pull-up the attached file, "Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"
183	I think we're OK here, but I don't want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter or that just doesn't make sense.
183	We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.
183	Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note saying thumbs up or down?
183	Thanks a bunch.
184	Rob, This is Jeff.
184	I'm with Susan in her office listening to the call.
184	Hey bud, LANDMINE!
184	Look at the new SoCalGas language respecting the Edison/SDG&E contract in Section 1.9.
184	Whadaythink?
184	Write back at this address!
184	Are you going to raise the issue?
185	Mark, Susan and I are online in her office if you need to shoot us a quick note.
185	Otherwise, blah, blah, blah......
186	Rob, Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last paragraph.
186	You know that this language was negotiated by and between SoCalGas and Edison.
186	My main concern is that its very, very open ended...
186	almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.
186	Jeff
187	pull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that document.
187	I don't necessarily think it does.
187	Didn't we basically agree to disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?
187	Are you saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of noncore, but at the approx.
187	7.9 cent rate?
187	HEY, WAIT A MINUTE....
187	is this language saying that they can convert the VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?
187	For example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver it to approx.
187	25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?
187	Let's get clarification!!!
188	Attached is a draft of the Declaration of Jeffery Fawcett.
188	If you have comments, please let me know.
188	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
189	you still there?
190	Quite good.
190	They definitely provide a chuckle.
191	This was one of the emails I told you about.
192	I'm available Tuesday also -- just let me know.
193	I'm there.
194	Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community property with his ex.
194	He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and save a lot in taxes!
194	Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work: I believe his number is 713-228-7401.
194	He's a nice guy and I believe him to be competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the best deal.
194	If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.
194	Hope this helps!
195	Glen, I'm faxing you Transwestern's signature page and declaration.
195	An electronic version of the declaration is attached.
196	Glen: I think this will be fine.
196	Please add the word "Company" after "Transwestern Pipeline" on the list of parties.
196	Thanks; we sincerely appreciate your efforts on this settlement.
196	Susan Scott
197	See the attached.
197	The proceeding certainly isn't over, but I think the parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the Commission will eventually approve, provided the parties present sufficient evidence to support such a decision.
197	(Unfortunately, we expect the settlement to be protested.) Direct testimony is due May 5.
197	To streamline things, the parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by topic.
197	Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.
197	I plan to put Mr. Fawcett on as a witness.
197	Our issue is not particularly controversial anymore, so I do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination; nevertheless, I will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing, which begins May 30.
198	Sorry for the delayed response, I got really busy Friday afternoon and didn't check my email before I left.
199	As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000 MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California at a higher rate.
199	SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.
199	In part, they are alleging that TW is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.
199	For example, under TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump alt.
199	firm in cycle 2.
199	SoCal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in-path alt.
199	point will be unable to re-nominate to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean USGT's] is confirmed.
199	According to SoCal this will substantially limit shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.
199	Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al.
199	delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves.
199	Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT will bump firm shippers.
199	I could really use your help in responding to this argument.
199	(First of all, I'm not sure I even understand it!) If either of you have a few minutes today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.
199	Also -- you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone else in your group if you are swamped.
199	Please e-mail or call when you get a chance...
199	Thanks!

200	AA is now unsure about what we should say here (aam I).
200	Can you help?
200	Thanks.
201	Here's the answer to your question regarding 28.
201	The depth and complexity are overwhelming.
202	Don't you mean no more.

204	Mike no longer writes actual tickets.
204	Confirms can find the information in the following location: All of Mike's tickets deals can be found in this same location on a daily basis.
205	Just found out from Minal that you guys are going to Osteria D'Aldo for your shower.
205	I hope you have a wonderful time but I have to warn you that the wine selection is extensive and the food is fantastic (although not very low-cal).
205	I know you're in the final stretch of the bet, however this just might be cause for a loss.
205	Bon Appetit!
206	I was remiss in excluding y'all from the original distribution.
206	Please except my apologies.
207	I obviously didn't get up this morning to work-out...So I was wondering if you wanted to go for a run before Felicity tonight.
207	I should be home by 6:30 or 7:00.
207	Let me know.
208	You know me...any excuse to celebrate.
208	Name a time and place...amazingly my calendar appears to be open tomorrow night.
209	Hey there, enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures!
209	Just a quick note to say that Bill will be coming with me this weekend, so Mema will have more than enough entertainment.
209	Tell Jim to bring his tennis gear and if the weather cooperates we can play.
209	He would probably enjoy hitting with Bill.
209	Saw Bruce Springsteen last night, even though I'm really not much of a fan.
209	Ann really wanted to go, and I knew it would be a good show (which it was).
209	He played for 3 hours and needless to say I'm pretty worthless this a.m. Look forward to seeing you soon.
210	Here it is.
210	Please let me know your comments today.
210	Thanks.
211	For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and morph into much more.
211	Every step you take seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities -- especially lately.
211	The old rules don't apply anymore.
211	The idea of signing up for something and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit an innovator like you.
211	Your developing success will beget an avalanche of more success.
211	Have your bags packed in preparation for spur of the moment opportunities and travel necessities.
211	Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big way.
211	You want to know more and experience life on a richer level.
211	You're not the same person you were even a year ago.
211	You understand more about yourself.
211	Be open to travel, moving, advanced training, and additional contact with media and publishing.
211	The word is out, Aquarius -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
212	For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive, and unlimited this month that you're capable of almost anything!
212	(You've privately believed that the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This month, your incredible adaptability and powers of persuasion help you shed the status quo and break out of the corral.
212	Unless you catch your foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you.
212	People are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and conversation.
212	(Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and provoke others to investigate things they may have taken for granted.
212	Speak up during the first week, especially if it's to announce you're starting a new venture.
212	Business travel is likely during the first and third weeks, especially if contractual issues need to be finalized.
212	Travel is actually enjoyable this month and can open your eyes to fresh horizons.
212	Aquarius.
212	.
212	.
212	you've dragged your tin cup across the bars long enough.
212	I smell a prison break.
212	.
212	.
212	.
213	What kind of time frame are we looking at?
214	Say 7:30-7:45 and your on.
215	Who all's going?
216	I'm not going to take any lip from you.
216	The name is Little Woodrow's and it's on W. Alabama just off of Kirby.
217	Who's picking on me?
217	I'll see what I can do but most of my girlfriends live in other cities and besides who wants to expend energy entertaining second string candidates?
218	Our regular Wednesday night crowd will be somewhat diminished.
218	However the most important individuals will be present...Us.
219	What is it about the two of you that you think I can't handle?
219	And believe me I am making efforts to enlist worthy participants.
220	Frank and Steve, see the attached.
220	My theory, which is based on our experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a gathering company).
220	Although it seems likely that other pipelines have entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.
220	Do you agree with my conclusion?
220	Any other ideas or insights?
220	Please let me know.
220	Thanks.
221	Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.
221	There is good precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the attached memo).
221	Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this.
222	Ginger, I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday.
222	However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my attendance.
222	If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the opportunity.
222	Please let me know if this is all right and I will do everything I can to attend.
223	You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.
223	The answer is no.
223	If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a column for "Pre-approved Terms" and one for "Non Pre-Approved Terms".
223	Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal Dept's approval.
223	Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's approval; those above the threshold do.
223	Does that make sense?
223	As far as I know our marketers have been following this.
223	I spoke with TK and she is aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any contract that deviates from our standard language.
223	She has also discussed this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the policy.
223	If we need to discuss this further please let me know.
224	Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.
224	Our consulting agreement with IGS (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract "identified by IGS" and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement.
224	During the term of the agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.
224	IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee.
224	While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity.
224	Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.
224	So, while Mark can certainly claim he "identified" the deal, he was not alone in doing so.
224	Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts).
224	Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy.
224	We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant.
224	On the other hand, I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee.
224	However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.
224	The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value.
224	If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS, let me know.
224	I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do decide to take us to court.
225	Just wanted to ease your mind and let you know that I have not discussed your impending move with anyone save those you have already informed.
225	I am well aware of the sensitivity of the subject.
225	Believe it or not, sometimes I am able to keep my mouth shut.
226	How was NY?
227	The post-id should be 766556.
227	I am still inputting the unofficial post-id on a daily basis in that file that was created for you all, O:\Erms\erms_adm\GasDaily\GDailyDrop.
227	Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
228	No I'm not close b/c I can't take off 2hrs from work to go run in the park.
228	However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count for extra.
228	Besides when did this become a contest I wouldn't think you'd consider me a worthy adversary...
228	at least not yet.
228	I do know the model you're speaking of, but isn't she married to some billionaire in Venezuela?
229	Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
229	I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one important caveat.
229	The individuals in question must be in the same strata.
229	I would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.
229	Of course if one is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy gets really old and slow.
229	Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?
229	Or do you not identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?
230	You're the greatest.
230	I think Little Woodrow's is on for tonight although I'm still waiting to see if my brother and his wife want to go out tonight (he leaves for South Korea Sunday), if they're a no go I will be on the deck with a bucket of beer.
230	P.S.
230	You are in peak physical condition.
231	So are you going tonight or not?
232	It looks like people are going to start arriving around 7:00 so I'd say just show up after your done running and getting all pretty.
232	I'm sure we'll all be there till at least 10:00.
233	Ben was actually already planning on going.
233	In fact he informed me he would be bringing a friend from Canada.
233	FYI - I didn't know there was a "friend" in Canada until very recently (although I had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until today.
233	Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine.
233	Also, Nick is going to bring Amy (his significant other).
233	Should be an interesting evening.
234	Again Mark I am flattered that you include me in these explanations...but I don't really need them anymore.
235	I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this morning's meeting.
235	I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc. but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.
235	Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in the best and most open manner possible.
235	In no way can or should your conduct be called into question.
235	Bearing that in mind any criticism that was expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.
235	I am sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those being criticized.
235	Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will inevitably open.
235	There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when they come along (which is exactly what you've done).
235	Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.
236	O.K.
236	Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.
236	Let me know if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the tickets today over the phone or on the internet.
236	Also, I was trying to remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.
236	I think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).
236	I promise I'm good for the money.
236	Also, was wondering if you're still interested in the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.
236	Just let me know.
236	Hope your having a wonderful day.
237	Jeff, didn't realize everyone else was going to use narrative format.
237	Now that I've had a chance to think about it, I think ours will look silly if it's in Q&A format.
237	I'll work on changing it this evening.
238	Keith, last week you and I discussed briefly Facilities Planning's proposal to change the service factor on the Gallup compressor in order to increase capacity.
238	I believe you had concluded that a certificate application would be necessary.
238	Now Arnold Eisenstein is asking me (thru our commercial people) whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the compressor -- in other words, through a pressure commitment.
238	My initial impression is yes, we would have to make a filing.
238	Am I out of my mind?
238	Does this make sense?
238	Please advise.
239	Steve's new idea is to send a letter to Mark asking him to document/explain exactly what his role was in getting this deal.
239	Comments?
239	Not sure I care one way or the other, but after I see how it looks in writing, I'll have a better idea of whether this is how we should approach it.
239	Multi-tasking heavily today.
239	I'll send you a draft of our PNM answer to Dynegy protest by close of business.
240	Yes, I will send you a draft shortly.
241	Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if possible.
242	We do not really have anything that specific, but I could at least point out that the San Juan lateral is fully subscribed.
243	Sure, why the heck not.
243	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
244	In honour of your departure I think it is only right that we do "Red Meat" one more time.
244	I feel as though I've said this a lot lately but...Congratulations.
244	I don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it over and over again so just know that I am completely sincere when I say it.
244	The money sounds fantastic, although I hope that aside from the money you enjoy and are challenged by your new role.
244	I may not know you inside and out but I do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will provide that for you.
244	Also, the step up position-wise is great and I think deserved.
244	As far as being scared goes, that'll be our little secret.
244	You do know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done.
244	I guess this means I'll have a good excuse to visit NY.
245	I may have to start training now for that.
246	Here is the quick & dirty.
246	None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date.
246	The respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are "tested and placed in service."
246	We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service.
246	The compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.
246	EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.
246	Based on our experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.
246	Today, we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity.
246	Nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.
246	Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.
246	When the compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.
246	The downside: we get no reservation charge at all.
246	(estimated loss: The upside: in the long run we probably save face with our customers. From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to revoke our "in-service" announcement. When summer weather kicks in, we'll probably have to allocate every day. On our EBB we will have to give some reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an explanation anyway). Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be triggered. The downside: shippers will never trust us again. Also, we could be subject to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was "in service" when we knew it was not. The upside: on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer. (In July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not delivered). We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption in mind. Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a memo for wider distribution, let me know. For now, I think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options. The longer we wait to get information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will be.
247	Sounds like a great idea -- let us know where/when.
248	Who all would you like on your guest list for tomorrow?
248	Regular crew?
249	I've called and checked before and evidently the steak cook comes rain, sleet, snow or hail.
249	So unless everyone's opposed to eating inside, if it's raining, we can go no matter what.
250	I apologise for the delay in my response to your email.
250	Thank you for contacting me regarding the rotational opportunity in your group.
250	While it sounds intriguing, I will not be able to pursue it as I have already begun my second rotation with ENA.
250	However, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your group and any possible future rotations.
250	Please let me know if you would be able to meet at some later date.
250	Thank you again.
251	FYI
252	FYI
253	Lorraine: here's Keith's brief response to your question about increasing capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the Gallup compressor.
253	Let me know where we need to go from here.
253	Susan, my understanding is that the capacity west to the California border is a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).
253	If in any way we try to change the certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.
253	TW is different than NNG, in that TW certificates capacity rather than facilities.
253	Arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.
253	Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.
253	Keith
254	It is tonight and it looks as though we will have great weather.
254	I'm planning on getting there ASAP as I've had a rough week already and need some beer in a bucket.
255	What time are you thinking about getting over there?
256	I will most likely have a good headstart by the time you get there.
257	By the way, when are you leaving for NY/moving all of your stuff?
257	And, when's your last day at the Big "E"?
258	I have purchased 4 tickets to Saturday night's show.
258	Maybe we can all go out to dinner before-hand or I wouldn't mind having everyone over to my place for a little wine and food?
258	Also, I don't think I can make this week's Tasters dinner because my old group is having a belated going away happy hour in honour of me.
258	PARTAY!!!
259	Are you still going to run?
260	I'm sure we can find you a ride over there.
260	What time do you think you're going to be finished-up here?
261	While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now more appropriate than ever.
261	One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when they trust.
261	Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause irreparable harm.
261	If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life.
261	There are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face.
261	I don't mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.
261	I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character.
261	The smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant.
261	(This includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect.) To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.
261	That beyond the hype and self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always be a part of us.
261	I think that only by recognizing those components and trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.
262	I too enjoyed our talk last night ( I'm always interested in other viewpoints, it is only by examining them that we challenge our own).
262	The Happy Hour tonight is at Teala's on West Dallas.
262	My recommendation is that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.
262	Hopefully by that time my old manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on his tab.
262	I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.
262	P.S.
262	Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated with.
263	I'm finally having my going away Happy Hour with my old group tonight so I'm out.
263	Sorry.
263	Hope you guys have fun (Don't forget Woody's is a cheese-fest)
264	Turns out my boss is going to get to Teala's at @ 5:00.
264	So if you want to show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.
264	I know Ben, Nick and possibly Sunil are planning on going so you may want to see when they are planning on getting there.
265	Tell Lisa that EOL sucks...I've had to rebook 40 screwed up deals...hope to be there by 7:00
266	Where were you last night?
267	Bummer.
267	Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule.
267	Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC.
267	We hiked down Bright Angel trail to the second rest stop, which was plenty for me.
267	It was pretty hot.
267	Wish we could have stuck around longer but Bill had to be back for a trial.
267	Talk about restrictive travel schedules.
267	I was thinking about you and Karin and wanting to take your customary nature trips...you know, when Grayson is a little older, we could go on some trips and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else goes hiking/climbing/whatever.
267	You might have to pay for extra hotel days that way, but at least you would get to go.
267	In the meantime, what about staying in one place for a week or so -- a beach house, for example.
267	Eric permitting, I think it would be fun to get everyone together in Florida or Colorado sometime within the next year.
267	My car is ready at the shop.
267	Yay!
267	Ciao,
268	FYI - Europe spends an average of $4-9 per person on the arts compared with the US at .64 and declining.
269	Jeff, we only need to send a copy to the Judge electronically.
269	This is why we've only seen a few from the other parties (I'm starting to receive some in the mail and will get you copies).
269	I'll do so promptly.
269	I'll e-mail one to Brian Cherry as well, and to anyone else who specifically requests it.
269	If you would prefer that I send to everyone electronically, let me know.
269	Copies were mailed to everyone Friday.
270	Hi Mum!
270	The trip was pretty exhausting.
270	Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.
270	Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool in the afternoon and I did some shopping.
270	Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon and did part of the Bright Angel trail.
270	That was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it.
270	Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had Bill's trial schedule to deal with.
270	I'll spare you the details of my trip home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.
270	I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in until later on Saturday.
270	How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on Sunday a.m.?
270	Have to run to a meeting ...
270	for race info, I would try a search for Texaco or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.
270	I know that Texaco probably has it on their website.
270	If you don't find anything let me know.
270	Love,
271	Brian: here is the electronic version of Jeff Fawcett's testimony.
272	Brian: because of the travel time involved, TW would prefer to reverse the schedule on May 24 (i.e., retail first, capacity second) -- if no one has any

274	We need to start a new "bucket" file called Direct Testimony.
274	Then please watch the mail and do a folder for each prepared testimony as they come in. Thank you!
275	Sorry I didn't return your call last night, Lisa and I went to hear Julie Andrews speak at Jones Hall and didn't get home until after 10:00 p.m.
275	Knowing what a precious commodity sleep is I refrained from possibly disturbing your own.
276	Hi there!
276	I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in "View" mode on my Lotus Notes.
276	What a pretty girl!
276	I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?
276	Let me know.
276	I was thinking of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.
276	I have no idea what to buy her!
276	must do some shopping today or tomorrow.
276	Trivia time: last night I went to the Astros game with some people from work.
276	One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.
276	She likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!
276	She told me she has a dog called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."
276	Now you know!
276	Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.
276	Love, proud auntie sooz
277	Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of an amendment to the original electric service agreement.
277	Dave, I'll bring you a copy of that agreement.
277	Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me know and I will fax it to you.
277	In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.
277	Please let me know if it looks alright to you.
277	I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.
277	My sincerest apologies for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to handling, and I appreciate your patience.
277	Susan
278	P.S.
278	-- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.
278	See Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.
278	If TW does not give such notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract automatically rolls over for another year.
278	If this is not acceptable please let me know.
279	What if we replace Section 2 with something like "This Agreement shall continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3," and replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to the intended date of termination."
279	Sound OK?
279	if so I'll add it to my draft.
280	Rich - Dave and I were just discussing whether a period less than 12 months would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg.
280	may bring some changes we want to take advantage of.
280	It's basically your call: if SPS were to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a replacement?
281	Hi Brian!
281	How nice to hear from you.
281	Congrats on being an uncle.
281	Scott is a good-looking baby!
281	Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a sweetie!
281	Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on babysitting skills.
281	I told them that when my niece is old enough to understand the command "Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on," I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!
281	I too am in no rush to have kids.
281	While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!
281	I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.
281	Picking up and moving can be a great thing sometimes.
281	I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.
281	There is just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.
281	The job is absolutely crazy.
281	If you ever watch "ER," that is usually what my day looks like, only without all the blood!
281	Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.
281	We sit in an open work area and it is chaotic every day.
281	But it's a good crash course in business for me, and my clients are wonderful.
281	Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!
281	E-mail is a wonderful thing.
281	Time to hit the tennis courts.
281	Love, Susan
282	Today we remember Jane Austen, the British writer born on this date in 1775Austen depreciated herself as a "miniaturist" and a domestic novelist of restricted scope, but her literary legacy is large.
282	She was also able to laself-deprecation aside, however, and in Northanger Abbey she declared thatnovels -- her chosen genre -- are works in which "the greatest powers of thmind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit andhumour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language."( Austen's work brims with general statements that are contradicted by the people in her stories. For instance, Pride and Prejudice opens by noting that "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." The book then describes Mrs. Bennett, mother of a household full of marriageable daughters as "a woman omean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper." As Austen acquaints us with the tale of each daughter's engagements, she wonders, "For what do we live, but to make sport for ourneighbors and laugh at them in our turn?"As Austen acquaints us with thetale of each daughter's engagements, she wonders, "For what do we live, butto make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?"
283	Here are my standard rules for my witnesses on examination by opposing counsel.
283	They are worth learning well ahead of time because they can be very difficult to follow.
283	Memorize these and we'll do fine on cross (assuming we even get any questions).
283	1.
283	Listen carefully to the question.
283	2.
283	Answer only that question; do not volunteer more.
283	3.
283	If you don't know for sure what the answer is, just say so.
283	4.
283	If you cannot answer a "yes" or "no" question with "yes" or "no," say so and explain why.
284	I could let the fluff comment fly if you were referring to a woman that hadwritten such works in present day, but given that Austen was dealing with acompletely different world with decidedly different expectations for the women in it I cannot.
284	The fact that she was able to challenge those limitexpectations and never allow her heroines to sell themselves short or compromise their character should not be taken for granted.
284	Yes, there is a definite romantic bent to her works, but in addition their is amazing insiginto people, their motives, their struggles and their capacity to surpriseeven themselves.
284	And in the end, what conquers in her novels is the union of two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each otherminds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that constituted the norm for that time.
285	Hi Mark...me again.
285	You really are missing my presence in the controls group aren't you?
286	Thought you'd be interested in this.
287	Hi Mum!
287	I'm up for birthday celebration this weekend.
287	Can you believe I actually have a gift for Jim already?
287	I'll try to get there as early as I can tomorrow.
287	Bill will not be coming with me because he has too much work piled up, including clients to visit in jail!
287	My first priority is sleep as I have not gotten much this week -- I keep waking up in the middle of the night; it's miserable.
287	To make things worse, I think a ghost has appeared to Goo.
287	She is really freaked out about something, pacing around and acting like she hears things.
287	Gabby is her usual self.

289	I'll just get with Ramona in the a.m. and see when she can meet & we'll go from there.
290	Here's a draft of a research memo on options.
290	While I am hopeful that we can overcome FERC's policy on reservation of capacity, our arguments obviously need to be developed a little more before we can do that.
290	I know the business folks are anxious to hear our strategy.
290	I would appreciate your comments on the attached.

299	I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago.
299	One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.
299	If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled IT.
299	Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.
299	As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.
299	Similarly, if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.
299	TW's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this -- a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported.
299	Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).
299	If so, is the change necessary for some other reason?
299	Please let me know what you think.

301	Hi Mum!
301	I had a fun time this weekend.
301	It was good to have everyone together.
301	Glad K&J are relaxing about Mema and the baby.
301	She gets such a kick out of seeing her.
301	Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!
301	Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.
301	Earlier when I was in a meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 610.
301	Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.
301	Had another sleepless night Sun.
301	and finally took some Unisom and had a good night's sleep last night.
301	What a relief.
301	I have really never had this problem before.
301	It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down sometime.
301	Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.
301	The following week (May 29 - June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have to be there that long.
301	Have a good afternoon!
301	Love,
302	In case you do not have my draft of the filing, here it is.
303	Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to SF next Tues.
303	thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.
303	I had thought about going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Boston the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better weekend for me to hang out in Cali.
303	It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be presented.
303	I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!
303	Makes it really hard to plan.
303	I'll know for sure by the 25th.
303	Thank goodness for refundable airline tickets.
303	Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend of June?
303	And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or Wednesday?
303	These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses and leave.
303	Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.
303	He was in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.
303	I joined him a few days later in Vegas.
303	Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.
303	We set out for Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 66 of course).
303	Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) and got real dusty and sunburned.
303	Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and hung out at the South Rim.
303	Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.
303	I would really love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the next.
303	Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul
304	Lynn -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for TW.
304	This is very much a work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics.
304	We've invited Darrell and Richard to the meeting; if there is anyone else you think we should include just let me know.
305	On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical conference.
305	The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.
305	The order does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to include: whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion of monopoly power.
305	Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas in interstate commerce, PNM will "have to either explain how it has appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission."
305	Lorraine has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the appropriate steps.
305	I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell you when I have further information.
305	If you would like a copy of the order, let me know.
306	Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper).
306	Here is the language you requested for our posting: In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges.
306	If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.
307	Please see the attached in connection with sales of capacity options on TW.
308	Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.
308	Page 1: Streamlined Credit -- what does "interested parties" mean?
308	parties interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their credit ?
308	Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.
308	(Don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding?).
308	Page 2: you state that "individual bid transactions are kept confidential."
308	What is confidential: the identity of the shipper?
308	the bid itself?
308	In TW's IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of the shipper.
308	We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time.
308	I notice you call them "sealed bids" on page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.
308	Page 3: why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?
308	Especially since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.
308	Our credit dept.
308	folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day.
308	If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).
308	Page 7: "an" Capacity Trading Agreement should be "a" Capacity Trading Agreement.
308	Page 8: So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future.
308	Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each bid.
308	A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.
308	They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or prior to, the first bid.
308	I recommend stating "You must submit a Request for Service prior to making your initial bid" so they don't think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid.
308	Page 9: Under "When TW will Respond": need to specify how notification will be sent.
308	Page 14: Column that says "Price" should say "Rate" (for a second there we thought you were talking about gas prices).
308	Also, please use example rates that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...) Thanks for all your hard work on this.
308	I'll be here if you have any questions.

309	When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline.
309	The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.
309	Specifically, the Commission stated: The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline.
309	Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline.
309	We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped.
309	Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped.
309	This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped.
309	I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.
309	You can feel free to pass this along to your contact at PNM.

312	The Word of the Day for May 19 is: *1 : of, relating to, or caused by witchcraft or the supernatural : magical 2 : of strange or extraordinary character : odd, fantasti Example sentence: "Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect."
312	(LouisaMay Alcott, Little Women) Did you know?
312	You may know today's word as a generalized term for anyth unusual, but "weird" also has older meanings that are mor specific.
312	"Weird" derives from the Old English noun "wyrd essentially meaning "fate."
312	By the late 8th century, theplural "wyrde" had begun to appear in texts as a gloss for the Latin name for the Fates -- three goddesses who spun, measured, and cut the thread of life. In the 15th and 16t centuries, Scots authors employed "werd" or "weird" in th phrase "weird sisters" to refer to the Fates. William Shakespeare adopted this usage in Macbeth, in which the "weird sisters" are depicted as three witches. Subsequent adjectival use of "weird" grew out of a reinterpretation of the "weird" in Shakespeare.

314	Steve, attached for your reading pleasure is the testimony we've filed in the GIR proceeding.
315	The man who thinks he can do without the world is indeed mistaken; but the man who thinks the world cannot do without him is mistaken even worse.
316	Well, I wanted you to have something to open ON your birthday.
316	Greetings from San Francisco!
316	I'm told we're having "earthquake weather" today.
316	Don't know what that means, but it sounds scary!
316	Hi to K. and G.!
317	In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here is my 2 cents' worth.
317	The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me).
317	See Section 13.A.
317	(Sheet No. 18): "All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue."
317	The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.
317	Even if the one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).
317	The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).
317	TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section.
317	The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.
317	I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other.
317	I believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.
317	Hope this helps.
317	If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.
317	My hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234).
318	Tried to print a blank form without success.
318	Is there any other way I can get one, so I can do some rough drafts of my reviews on my business trip next week.
318	Please advise.
319	Christine, this looks fine to me.
319	Please circulate to the appropriate people for approval with a notation that Appendix or Exhibit whatever provides that the quantity goes to zero during Apr-Oct.
319	If you need to reach me, I'll be logged in from about 9 to 10 a.m. your time before I go to our hearing here in SF.
319	Sorry for the late response; it's been a little crazy out here!
320	Approved.
321	Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the distribution list.
321	I know that he has access to the same info, but to give him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.
321	I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today.
322	Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those months.
322	I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would work.
322	We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I recall correctly.
322	Also -- I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.
322	In case FERC does not like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the rest of the deal stand?
322	It would depend on how much value the parties are attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.
322	Christine, let me know which is preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m.
323	Mike, please see the attached, which incorporates the changes we discussed yesterday.
323	If this looks acceptable to you, please sign two originals and forward them to me.
323	Thanks.

324	Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.
324	The judge mentioned she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised that you did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at least to let us review the exhibit.
324	I would like to review the exhibit as soon as possible.
324	I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or fax it to 941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).
324	Also, I should be reachable on my mobile phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office (713-853-0596).
325	Glen, thanks for the quick response.
325	The process the parties agreed upon yesterday is acceptable to TW.
325	Sorry to hear there was an emergency at home; I hope all is well by now.
326	Luckily, we will have input re.
326	the exhibit, and if SoCal does not cooperate to make it accurate, we will be able to file our own with an explanation.
326	Lad is such a weasel.
326	Why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m.
327	Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis.
327	It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.
327	However, I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition.
327	As you may be aware, the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers.
327	NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.
327	The underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily.
327	But of course the Commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious.
327	Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. basis?).
327	Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process.
327	Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the Enrononline process.
327	Now for some trivia.
327	Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for determining best bid?
327	In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.
327	In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated: "The Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins."
327	The only problem is I am not sure we have that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method.
327	Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so.
327	I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write I'd be happy to.
328	If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, either with an amendment or a separate agreement.
328	I'll be in the office by about 9:30 and we can talk about it then.
329	Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.
329	Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).
329	Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.
329	The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.
329	Comments?
329	let me know.
330	I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at sooner, that would be great...TW's business people who need to look at it will be out at the beginning of next week.
330	Thanks.
331	Something's up with our e-mail, but I did receive it finally.
331	Thanks.
332	I would expect that Sarah Tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make good on our promise.
333	Brian, Transwestern has reviewed your draft exhibit responsive to Judge Biren's inquiry on June 7.
333	We appreciate your work on it and generally agree with the exhibit and the approach taken by SoCalGas.
333	However, we think it appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge Biren's questions.
333	See the attached marked-up version of the exhibit.
333	We've attempted to streamline the data provided for "non-Wheeler" points, and to clarify the footnotes regarding Wheeler Ridge.
333	Also, we've modified the numbers regarding the TW Topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 400 MMcf/d physical capability.
333	We've also made some minor formatting changes.
333	Let us know what you think.
333	Jeff Fawcett Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
334	Tony, I'd love to see our posting on EnronOnline -- do you know if there's an easy way for us "insiders" to access it?
335	You got mail from Norm!
336	In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the terminology being used here.
336	As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign "primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.
336	The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.
336	However, if what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following.
336	Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt point.
336	Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.
336	Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.
337	Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit drafting process.
337	Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC filings, for that matter).
337	If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be allowed into the record.
337	Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions.
337	I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let you know if he does.
338	WRONG!!
339	Mike, obviously this is unacceptable.
339	Norm's exhibit contains factual inaccuracies we cannot live with.
339	I'm assuming the rest of the group will react similarly and Norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit.
339	Your thoughts?
340	Brian, just so you know Transwestern's reaction, Pedersen's exhibit contains factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (e.g., footnote 4).
340	If he wants to file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.
340	We don't plan to offer any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.
340	With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently drafted for purposes of this proceeding.
340	Any questions or comments -- let me know.
341	I'm planning to be out August 28 - Sept 1.
342	Read the very bottom....
342	Compliments of your minion.
343	(just so you know where we ended up last Fri.)
344	Brian -- TW does not agree with the changes proposed by El Paso.
344	If we need to discuss this further please e-mail or call.
344	Thanks.
344	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
345	Amazing that TW has not one but TWO people doing this job.
345	Your tree-saving efforts are admirable.
346	Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.
346	The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement.
346	Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.
346	I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.
346	A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.
346	Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues.
346	I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.
346	Thanks.
347	With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?
347	If the replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away.
347	(It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).
347	Probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper.
347	This would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice.
347	Another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.
347	For longer-term deals this might not be practicable, though.
347	Further questions...let me know.
348	Ramona, "total cost commitment" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue to be received from a transaction, taking into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity revenues associated with any minimum throughput commitment the shipper may make.
348	Obviously some of these items aren't applicable in the PNR context; the language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.
348	For PNR we would just multiply rate times number of days the service will be used.
348	Practically speaking, I'm not sure how this is done if you have an interruptible service with no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the number of days in the contract term.
348	If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.
348	We do not have to offer a right to match.
349	This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there exist some semblence of reason.
349	I remembered you mentioning that neither you nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.
349	So...I thought I should let you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B. Anyway it should be pretty good.
349	Music starts at 9:00.
350	Hi Mum!
350	If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would be fun.
350	I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about what they do.
350	Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of my long-range plan.
350	If not, I will have met some interesting people.
350	If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my Sat.
350	a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on Monday morning.
350	The week is going OK.
350	All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore muscles so this is my night off.
350	Am planning to do some more house chores so I do not end up with another weekend like the last.
350	I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, but I'll let you know.
350	Call if you get lonely!

352	I think my cohorts were ruing my existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).
352	I'm sure you managed to have an all right time in SF as well.
352	I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this week.
352	It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.
352	As for Austin, I have a wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to share.

353	Yes...I am a true Longhorn.
353	I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.
353	I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).
353	Anyway, Wednesday night sounds good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be able to get there before 7:30.
353	Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any bloodshed).
353	I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it should a good group.

354	So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.
354	If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.
354	Please let me know one way or the other.
354	Thank you.
355	Appoved.
355	See the attached which has some minor changes.

359	If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough input on Fri.
360	I'm saving this message, by the way.
360	Your characterization of Omaha may be worth money someday.
361	Hey!
361	I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.
361	Bill won't be coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.
361	I will probably go home on Mon.
361	afternoon.
361	Our friends are having their lake house party on the 4th.
361	Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.
361	Can't wait to see Gbug!
361	You know Mema is going to be really excited to see her eat carrots.
361	(I think she's coming in on Sunday.) I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would appreciate also: See you soon!
362	Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.
362	Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.
362	1.
362	The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.
362	2.
362	Price: the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.
362	We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.
362	3.
362	Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option.
362	4.
362	Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether.
362	5.
362	May need to address: assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance.
362	6.
362	Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.
362	I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.
363	Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!
363	Several of my neighbors were also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.
363	I don't know whether we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.
363	Jose and Gigi's party was attended by more kids than ever.
363	There were a lot of West U parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.
363	We did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi with the pinatas, and got home around 7.
363	The traffic on I-45 was really starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.
363	Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.
363	Love,
364	Hi yourself, Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the impression you could have done without some of the sights.
364	Mom thinks it must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.
364	Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.
364	I drove to Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.
364	We ate at Guerro's and then hit Cedar door for a little while.
364	There wasn't anything going on there so I suggested we try Cedar Street.
364	Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, walks by our table at the bar.
364	He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting down with us the rest of the evening.
364	His friends joined us as soon as they had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.
364	We ended up going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.
364	Before we parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell phone number.
364	Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.
364	He called us Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it was very good.
364	His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday gift...Big Hit.
364	Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.
364	(One of the best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels pretty strongly about as well.) So at this point I'll pretty much just run through the stats: Weight : about 225 lbs.
364	Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where) Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it may be more of an issue for him than me.
364	Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA ETC: Youngest of three children.
364	Appears to like/be close to his family.
364	Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion) His dad was in the Navy Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of humor and likes to laugh He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in the hill country Best Quotes: "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."
364	"Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great businessman. Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and three of them are married."
364	"Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker than any group of women I've ever met."
364	"I really want to learn how to two step."
364	So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every capacity).
364	There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you informed of any progress.
364	Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, the job hunt and everything else is going.
364	Susan
365	Ted, Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of indulgence and excess.
365	It took everything I had to get in the car and start the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before heading out).
365	As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the least I could do.
365	After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this weekend.
365	So, dinner Saturday sounds good.
365	As it stands right now, I am having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.
365	Susan
366	Since I am swamped I've asked Steve Stojic to take a first crack at it.
367	Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change.
367	However, I would ask that we eliminate the word "volumetric" as that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.
367	I.e., if we were truly to have "volumetric" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate schedule!
367	I just don't want to use this word.
367	I don't think it's necessary in order to convey Larry's meaning.
367	Why don't we insert: "on a daily basis only to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized".
367	If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.
367	If he comes up with any more issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.
368	thanks, Donna -- good work.
369	Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to FERC decisions.
369	In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ?
369	61,102, reh'g denied, 75 approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.
369	In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ?
369	61,394 (1997), the Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes operationally available for various reasons from time to time.
369	But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of "pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is available" that I thought existed.
370	Ted, I spoke with Shanna a little while ago about your friend and the apartment and she said she was fine with the deal.
370	Talk to you later.
370	Susan
371	(I haven't reviewed this yet but will have a chance to this afternoon.)
372	Here's the draft I referred to in my e-mail -- let me know if you have comments or questions.
373	At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect this.
373	Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could have said it, but ...
373	Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.
373	If there is no objection I'm going to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.
374	Dear Judge Biren: Attached is an electronic version of Transwestern Pipeline Company's Opening Brief, which will be filed with the Commission today.
374	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
375	Hey yourself, Actually, my day is going very well.
375	It just so happens that my trader is out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.
375	All I want to know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).
375	Anyway, my roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night sounds good.
375	Just fill me in on the details.
375	Susan PS - I'll be purchasing my neon, leopard-print cowboy hat shortly.
376	Attached is Transwestern Pipeline Company's Opening Brief which was filed yesterday.
377	Paul, governing law in paragraph 9 needs to be Texas.
377	If this is a problem, give me a call because we'll need to discuss it with Drew.
377	Subject to this one change, I approve this agreement.
378	Just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get a hold of you and make life less than pleasant.
378	How a person can be in Hilton Head, SC and still sound like he's going to have a heart attack is beyond me.
379	Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).
379	As for the hat/casual western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia.
380	Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week.
380	Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14.
380	The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC Mon.
380	July 17 - Wed.
380	July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing Thursday, July 27 FERC filing Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.
380	Thank you.
381	Hi Mum.
381	Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.
381	So go ahead and order tickets if you like.
381	I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.
381	Allie's wedding is Dec. 16.
381	at Sundance.
381	If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I could hit the bunny slopes together.
381	I want to take lessons, and stick to the easy runs.
381	No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it is.
381	Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.
381	I have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, and have told him so.
381	So I'm not sure what will happen.
381	Are you interested in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?
381	Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.
381	Love,
382	Number 8 made me think of you...

383	Oops, I meant to send this note to Mary Darveaux instead -- my apologies!
384	Ted, I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.
384	So, you may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to bring up the site.
384	Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.
384	Still, I think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to project.
384	If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...
384	Disclaimer: Please realize these sites were sent in jest.
384	If you actually don any of the items contained within them I may be forced to sever all ties and deny ever having known you.
385	Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before.
385	One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.
385	The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.
385	So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.
385	This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.
385	That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.
385	This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package.
385	Does this make sense to you?
385	If not, give me a call.
386	There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a non-native Texan acquiring western wear.
386	Remember slow and steady wins the race.
386	One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.
386	-- I'm intrigued...what exactly is the Hawaiian Biker ensemble?
387	I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.
387	Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.
387	One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.
387	We are planning to include a revenue estimate.
387	I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing.
387	Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?
387	The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY.
388	Fifth grade assignment The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it.
388	The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.
388	Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess."
388	"And what's the moral of the story?"
388	Asked the teacher.
388	"Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"
388	"Very good," said the teacher.
388	"Now, Lucy?"
388	"Our family are farmers too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're hatched."
388	"That was a fine story Lucy."
388	"Johnny do you have a story to share?"
388	"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob. Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit. He had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops. He killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
388	"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"
388	"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."
389	Hey Math-Wiz, I completely understand your plight.
389	I too am suffering a two o'clock, post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).
389	Anyway, I think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.
389	Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem...
389	just let me know the gate code, apt.
389	#, etc. Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over there?
389	(For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.) Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).
389	Susan
390	Sounds good to me...Coincidentally, a made service will be coming to clean my car this evening Susan
391	Ted, My day is going quite well, actually.
391	I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.
391	I'm not sure if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your "rule-breaking", but I'm going to try to look past that.
391	I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and better.
391	As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.
391	Talk to you soon.
391	Susan -- By the way, I'm very relieved to hear about the buckle.
392	For discussion this a.m.
393	According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate. Do you concur? Any comments?
394	Ted, I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T.
394	football game was Labor Day weekend.
394	It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m. So basically it should be a very challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).
394	Hope your day's going well.
394	Shorty FYI - U.T.
394	plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)
395	After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questionsthat need to be resolved.
395	Some of them have needed to be resolved for quitsome time.
395	Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already beendiscussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnlinesite, and I just need to get up to speed.
395	To the extent there aren't answers yet, I'll get busy researching.
395	Drew -- comments?
395	Shall we all get on thephone & discuss this?
395	List of TW contracting issues 1.
395	Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated ratepolicy: a.
395	Transwestern's current form discount letter states: "[t]he total charshall include all applicable surcharges."
395	Should this language be revisedand if so, how?
395	b.
395	Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language inits discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combinedrate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of surcharges.
395	Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?
395	material deviatiofrom the tariff?
395	c.
395	Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no eventshall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minimum rates provided in Transwestern,s tariff.
395	This was intended as assurance that the contract is not a negotiated rate.
395	Is this language still effective?
395	necessary?
395	a.
395	When should IOS be conducted, if at all?
395	b.
395	Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional bidding procedures)?
395	c.
395	Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddinsituations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid evaluation procedures in the tariff?
395	If not, what changes need to be made?
396	Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles interconnect with SoCal.
396	Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles but does not extend the same privilege to TW.
396	I'm unsure how it would work.
396	TW does have a couple of interconnects with El Paso's system.
396	I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using their system) to access South Needles.
396	Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.
396	I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns.
396	My apologies for the delay.
396	Call if you have any questions or comments to discuss!
397	No probola!
397	It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.
397	Maybe I will go this weekend.
397	So glad you had rain over the weekend!
397	We did too, and we had had a dry spell for almost as long.
397	I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, which was starting to smell like cooked grass.
397	Bill and I are on the outs.
397	He just will not do what he needs to in order to make things work, so I have given up.
397	Of course now he is trying to be charming.
397	Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.
397	The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to plan a trip to D.C. at last.
397	Maybe early Sept?
397	Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.
397	Time to work!
397	Love,
398	Hey Bo, I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way tickets from New Orleans.
398	It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).
398	Sissy By the way, I didn't even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.
398	Roger Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.
398	We may have to watch this one at some point.
398	"The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive.
398	Because it is also the 19th James Bond movie, it comes with so much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to earlier famous vintages; I guess that's part of the fun.
398	This is a good one.
399	Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to our providing information to our vendors.
399	Each agreement should be printed as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.
399	I understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris is out this week also.
399	Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order to expedite things.
399	If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.
400	A good wit is a terrible thing to waste...
400	As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.
400	Just name the time and place.
400	Also, there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant for tomorrow night just because I have to be a smart-ass every once in a while.

402	Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he??
402	I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.
402	My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one component from exceeding the max or going below the min.
402	Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions!
403	Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement.
404	Approved
405	Hey Handsome, I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable hour today.
405	Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked against me.
405	Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m.
405	is definitely do-able.
405	However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate when we get closer to 4:30 p.m.
405	and I have a better idea where I stand.
405	Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used to it.
405	Susan
406	Thanks Keith.
406	Feel free to coordinate with Jeff to put together a meeting to get the info you need.
406	I do not know the answer to your questions offhand, and Ron is out this week.
407	This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be able to provide.
407	I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who should have to do this.
407	Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this is something HR is not capable of taking care of.
408	Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.
408	Ordinarily, you do not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company.
408	The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later that the agreement is not valid.
409	I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim Sunday.
409	(Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much "cooler" than mine.) -- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last night.
409	You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a valiant effort).
410	Look at you trying to bring me out of my shell.
410	I don't know if I'm really ready though to meet so many new people.
410	Remember...I am a shy, retiring
411	Okay, okay...The real Susan is back.
411	So, do you think I should sport the leopard pants to the party?
411	By the way, your personal taxi service is on call Sunday so just let me know when you need to be picked up (you're flying out of intercontinental, right?).
412	I've managed to "handle" myself for almost 24 years just fine, thank you very much...Evidently someone thinks they're pretty irresistible.
413	Hi Mum!
413	Sorry I have not called you back.
413	I have been out late every nite and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.
413	Am on the trading floor this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.
413	But I'll give you a call this afternoon.
413	Our little bar examinee is alive and well.
413	They've changed the schedule so the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.
413	She joined me and my work crowd last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.
413	So I've already celebrated appropriately!
413	What do you think of my Destin idea?
413	talk to you soon Love,
414	Matt, here are redlined and clean versions.
414	Let me know whether the revisions are acceptable.
414	Thanks, Susan
415	Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go to the theatre.
415	Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home viewing experience...namely the viewing.
416	As you requested.
417	Okay, I'm dying to know...What was wrong with the car?
417	Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do you have to go get it.
417	(Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.) As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these days as well.
418	Here is the agreement with the changes you requested.
419	Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.
419	Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market.
419	Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?
419	I will have Janet call to determine your availability.
420	Hey, I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates below.
420	They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would boost my B.S.
420	factor would be much appreciated.
420	I seem to remember you mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very rarely, been known to be wrong.
420	Hope your day is going well and that you aren't having to carry Darren too much.
420	Evan Betzer Jay Epstein Bill Keeney John Massey Kevin Ruscitti Jennifer Adams Gautam Gupta Claudio Ribeiro Doug Sewell -- I finally watched the movie last night.
420	I laughed, I cried...it became a part of me.
420	Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.
420	So did John or Fritz pass along the "Bible" to you?
420	(Whoever it was you can thank them for me.)
421	Matt -- are you going to have Snake Hill sign as well?
421	I can e-mail the agreement to him if you prefer.
421	Thanks.
421	Susan
422	You have just received the "Aggie Virus"!!!
422	Since Aggies arn't very smart and don't have any programming experience, this Virus works on the honor system.
422	Please delete all the files on your hard drive, and manually forward this Virus to everyone on your mailing list.
423	Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.
423	As for the jokes, I am very afraid and yet undaunted.
423	Do me one last favor and tell Darren I said he's a real funny guy and that there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back.
424	You know I was just teasing, right?
424	And, no dating is definitely not a bad thing.
424	As for being or not being fortunate enough, just remember...your good enough, your smart enough and dog-gonnit people like you.
424	Have fun tomorrow night and try up that fortune.
425	I do not see any problems with this.
426	Christine, see the attached.
426	I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).
426	My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.
426	As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.
426	If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt.
426	points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).
426	If we're still living in a max.
426	rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max.
426	rate.
426	Any questions -- give me a call.
427	FYI.
428	Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions.
428	Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.
428	12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec.
428	1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis.
428	Sec.
428	2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.
428	Sec.
428	4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).
428	The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.
428	2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec.
428	3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140).
428	Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec.
428	1.3 of 12/92 agreement.
428	9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective.
428	My initial conclusions: It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements.
428	Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.
428	In that case we can argue impossibility of performance.
428	Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure.
428	This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years.
428	The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now).
428	Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications.
428	That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.
429	(You know you haven't sent me any funnies in a while either. I'll let it go for now since you're working so hard...but you're going to have to deliver at some point.) 1.
429	Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
429	Answer: "I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever."

431	In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for project development: Retainer: $1000/month plus expenses Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles): Proposal $5000 Each month TW actively negotiating project: $1500/month (each project) Letter of Intent: $5000 Signed Agreement: $10,000 Incentive Fee: To be determined When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.
431	In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- $3000/mo.).
431	This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only.
431	The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party "identified by IGS under this agreement."
431	As you know, the "identified by" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal.
431	Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement.
431	Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.
431	This immediately eliminates the "identified by" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.
431	I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.
431	If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed).
431	For each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.
431	I've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.
431	The numbers are Mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.
431	I've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern.
431	Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed.
431	From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.
431	If Transwestern desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions: 1.
431	Retainer for project development: $1000/month plus expenses.
431	Project development shall include but not be limited to: research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal.
431	Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.
431	Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project.
431	2.
431	If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project].
431	"Accepting the project" means that the project meets Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion.
431	Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion.
431	3.
431	If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.
431	Additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project).
431	(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).
432	I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you an out.

434	Hey, My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so today should be a piece of cake).
434	I know you guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it paid off and the presentation went well yesterday.
434	However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in the short term, I'm not sure that was necessarily the case.
434	Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit (so were you able to resist the red wine this time, you lush?).
434	In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've attached little story for you...I got a pretty good chuckle out of this one.
434	PS.
434	- Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as usual, had a great time.
434	Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for actually making it through a home movie Subject: FW: FW: Southwest Airlines
435	There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it.

436	Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully.
436	At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.
436	However, having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors.
436	Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the memory of an elephant).
436	I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32.
436	Now back to what's really important...you.
436	Thought you'd like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and your needs.
437	Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.
437	Overall the meeting was very positive.
437	We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives.
437	However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed Ross) had a couple of issues.
437	The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern.
437	Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.
437	They have run into situations in which pipelines (examples: Koch, El Paso) have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do deals with them.
437	(In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's price option deals with its affiliate.) The perception is that the affiliates, by using "funny money," can always make themselves the highest bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + affiliate).
437	The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.
437	The presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.
437	Dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay "real" dollars.
437	While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates.
437	It is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing.
437	Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates.
437	Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and our reactions were the same.
437	Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to do business with TW.
437	We can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue.
437	The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate.
437	My analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.
437	If you think this is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets.
437	Sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest.
437	Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service.
437	Jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting.
437	If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.
438	Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D) The play was very good and I think well received.
438	I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.
438	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).
438	I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).
438	Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.
438	As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).
438	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went.
438	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.
438	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?
438	She's a very fun girl.
438	Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.
438	Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.
438	Shorty -- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around to it.
439	Hey there yourself, Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.
439	I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents.
439	As much fun as they are, I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.
439	As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people).
439	But, we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc. In one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read.
439	Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.
439	Hopefully, if we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit.
439	I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T.
439	games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair that is a U.T. game).
439	Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.
439	I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.
439	Also, I'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter Julie.
439	Needless to say I am very excited.
439	Talk to you guys soon, Susan
440	I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps: 1.
440	Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.
440	Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to Burlington.
440	(The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2.
440	On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.
440	The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.
440	This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.
440	However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."
440	As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first.
440	Let me know if you have further questions.
441	Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned in my previous e-mail.
441	Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.
441	I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.
441	The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up conversation with BR Thursday.
441	I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.
441	They claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.
441	Michele and Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.
441	I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.
441	They will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically "best efforts" and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so we will need to revise this further.
441	We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.
441	They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06).
441	The ball is in our court.
442	John, I think that sounds fine.
442	I really have no other comments on the org chart or job descriptions.
442	Thanks so much for your help!
443	First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with Deron moving in. However, in return I would ask for increased rent of $650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear & tear.
443	After you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable.
443	I'll try to answer all your questions: Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse as we would be removing light items for heavier items.
443	A. I really do not think it is a problem.
443	In addition to the oak floor, there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.
443	I'd draw the line at a waterbed, though!
443	Q. The stove is a bit problematic...
443	A. No problem to look into this.
443	I'm sure it can be repaired.
443	I will give the appliance folks a call.
443	Q. Do you know if the garage apt.
443	would support a 2nd line being installed?
443	A. I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.
443	Q. Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for sure?
443	A. I have a bad feeling about those connections!
443	I'll get them up and running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.
443	Q. I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric?
443	A. I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical.
443	Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric!
443	If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.
443	Q. At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days...
443	Would it be possible to look into this?
443	A. I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there.
443	It's cheap to install and fairly easy except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you-know-what.
443	I will call & ask my handyman, unless you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.
443	Q. Do you know if any paint is leftover?
443	A. The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be some left in the garage.
443	I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.
443	The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use that middle space.
443	I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to park on the street.
443	The other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley.
443	If I did this do you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?
443	As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that's okay with y'all.
443	Call if you have further questions!
444	The counterparty for that deal is Enron Omaha and the contact is Larry Paulou.
444	I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the counterparty as New this morning.
444	Let me know if there is anything else you need.
445	Your own personal palm pilot hard at work.
445	As promised, here's a list of UT's games this season...color coded for your convenience of course.
445	Sep 23 Houston, TBA Sep 30 Oklahoma St., TBA huge game...the two teams meet halfway at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas) Oct 14 at Colorado, TBA Oct 21 Missouri, TBA Oct 28 Baylor, TBA Nov 4 at Texas Tech, 2:00pm Nov 11 at Kansas, TBA Nov 24 Texas A&M, 3:30pm (Thanksgiving Weekend) All Times Eastern * Home games are in burnt orange...what else?
446	I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met.
446	The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an "eligible facility" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i): they are necessary to provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.
446	The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.
446	(Sec. 157.208).
446	If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7(c) certificate.
446	I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able to find out: In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing Part 284 rates.
446	This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to construct the San Juan lateral.
446	TW requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum.
446	The Commission stated, however, that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.
446	So TW made a Section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral.
446	Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau rates.
446	As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.
446	However, if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season.
446	In any event, in the context of a 7(c) application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.
446	At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.
446	I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know.
447	Same dude...and he is good.
447	We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little Woodrows which of course makes me happy.
447	Also, I just sent him a list of all the UT games so he can start planning to attend.
447	As soon as he decides on a first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and others.
447	That's a lot of prep work.
448	Lesli, I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below.
448	Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to be rebooked as soon as the CP's are set up.
448	If you could just let me know when the new CP's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.
448	Thanks, Susan
449	Fly me to the moon.
450	Somehow the "one-part rate" glossary item fell off of TW's list so I've revised it again.
451	Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night.
451	I had to work late last night...Big Shock!!!
451	Anyway, hope it was fun and that you're having a great week.
451	Mine has been pretty busy work wise.
451	I'm sure you're curious about Mr. Noble.
451	All I can say right now is that, while I definitely still like him (we had a great time Sunday), I am some what annoyed with him right now...he's been very wishy-washy the first half of this week.
451	I'm not real sure what I'm going to do about it, but I'm sure I'll think of something.
452	I owe Michele a call because she has a couple of questions.
452	Will do after I finish options draft.
453	Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to: - explain filing system - hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and next week is fine) - explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.
453	Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise access to my Lotus Organizer.
453	Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's station but see if you can do this also.
453	I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.
453	Merci beaucoup!
454	Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.
454	1.
454	I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the following cast of characters: Steve Harris Kevin Hyatt Lindy Donoho Jeff Fawcett Christine Stokes Michelle Lokay Lorraine Lindberg When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone to x34516).
454	These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize meetings with, distribute things to, etc. Their assistant is Audrey Robertson.
454	I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her 2.
454	Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.
454	I'm not picky about when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in early or stay late.
454	I think I asked Janet only twice.
454	3.
454	Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot: - TW Options (a tariff filing) - Order 637 compliance - Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect) 4.
454	Standing meetings: - TW Commercial Group staff meeting: Monday at 9:30 - Omaha regulatory staff meeting: Tues.
454	at 8:15.
454	- Therapist: every few weeks Thurs.
454	9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!) 5.
454	Faxes: I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call first.
454	Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).
454	6.
454	Mail: Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.
454	7.
454	Filing: I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.
454	However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.
454	Filing is pretty important to me.
454	I promise to try to let you know what files are more important than others so you can prioritize.
454	The good news: I rarely ever go to the extent where I would have you index a file.
454	Just putting things in the right folder is enough.
454	8.
454	Computer files: At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 3rdqtr00, etc.) 9.
454	Calendar: Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the calendar.
454	10.
454	Friends you're likely to hear from a lot: Ann, Bill, my grandmother ("Ms. Savoy"), Dianna 11.
454	The Other Susan Scott: There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.
454	I get her mail and phone calls all the time!
454	Her extension is 31445.
454	Not sure of her location as it seems to change a lot.
454	I look forward very much to working with you!!
455	Sorry I didn't get a chance to buy you a beer last night - we got there late.
455	I owe you one.
455	Hope you had a great birthday.
456	Well, this may go down as one of my absolute worst weeks ever.
456	Hope yours was better and that you made a full recovery from Steak Night.
457	Okay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to be like that for about the next three years.
457	However, this season will give us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from now.
457	Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.
457	With the #1 recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the future looks bright for the Longhorns.
457	Besides, our stadium's on campus and we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun regardless of how weak the opponents may be.
457	Counter?
457	Shorty
458	Lexi, I will be able to attend and am going to try to get to Austin in time for the faculty lunch.
458	I will let you know if I can make the lunch for sure after I've worked out my travel arrangements.
458	Thanks, Susan
459	Agustin, You are right, the correct deal number for Industrias del Etileno is just Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
460	Cinderella in Her Later Years.......
460	Cinderella was now 75 years old.
460	After a fulfilling life with the now dead Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.
460	One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.
460	Cinderella said "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years??"
460	The Fairy godmother replied "Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"
460	Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish: "I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."
460	Instantly, her rocking chair was turned into solid gold.
460	Cinderella was stunned.
460	Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch, quivering with fear.
460	Cinderella said "Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother".
460	The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your heart want for your second wish?"
460	Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."
460	At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned.
460	Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her.
460	Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall you have?"
460	Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says"; "I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and handsome young man". Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet. The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Cinderella.
460	Enjoy your new life."
460	And, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms. He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered: "I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"
461	This one kind of gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling inside.
461	Knowing that you are benefiting mankind by working for the Big "E".
462	Read it and weep...Just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back with me in case you don't make it out there this weekend.
462	I'm thinking I may need to get Julie to hook me up with a job like hers...if it will allow me to live like we're evidently going to this weekend.
462	Shorty
463	Julie, Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.
463	I would love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc. I've made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.
463	I'm going to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.
463	Anyway, like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe me it's much needed).
463	Susan I'll give you the exact times tomorrow, but my flight gets in around 9:00 a.m. on Saturday and doesn't leave until around 6:00 p.m.
463	on Monday.
463	Talk to you tomorrow.
464	Not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the Options filing in case you need it.
465	Do we need to talk?
466	Here is the draft for distribution.
466	In addition to the customer-friendly "looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following: Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.
466	We are providing these draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to filing.
466	The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your company.
466	Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management approval prior to filing with the Commission.
467	Hey Darren, I haven't forgotten that I still owe you a birthday beer.
467	In fact, Ted was kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy feelings of guilt.
467	Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend at Kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer.
467	Let me know if you have any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck until another time.
467	Susan
468	Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.
468	Since it is a maximum rate deal, there is no discount letter.
468	However, I am circulating this for approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.
468	Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account information.
468	My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval as soon as possible.
468	Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if possible.
468	Thank you.
469	The offer still stands but the location has changed...We're meeting at the Gingerman instead of Kenneally's (so alas no pizza - but oh, what a selection of beer).
470	The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the marketing fee.
470	The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement (i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the attached instead.
470	Questions or comments -- let me know.
471	Lesli, All of the deals listed below have been rebooked to their respective counterparties.
471	Susan
472	Julie, Sorry for the delayed response.
472	I can't express to you how excited I am to be coming out there this weekend.
472	After the last week and a half of work I am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of shopping).
472	As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.
472	My guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I say we just get going.
472	The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.
472	I would definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some other things.
472	The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good seafood.
472	Anyway, I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m.
472	so we've almost got three full days to work with.
472	Love, Susan -- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross
473	I thought you'd really like the one in blue.
473	My fav's the one in red.
474	Hey Pavarotti, Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big presentation tomorrow.
474	My day is going significantly better than yesterday so I am pleased.
474	Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.
474	By the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always get the two confused).
474	Now for the rule-breaking.
474	I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I hope you can forgive my rudeness).
474	Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.
474	Shorty - - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr.
474	old niece got in trouble on the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.
474	Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.
475	Lesli, Both deals have been rebooked.
475	Susan
476	Em, Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home.
476	I'm sure you'll be adjusting to the time change for a few days, but hopefully this time you won't get sick.
476	Say, "Hi" to Katy for me and tell her I will email her soon to try and figure when is the best time to come visit.
476	Now on to the business at hand.
476	Thought I'd let you see the last email exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.
476	Start from the bottom with my email and then read his response.
476	I would love to hear your insight on it all.
476	Here's my thought at this point.
476	I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at once.
476	To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.
476	Realizing this, I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?
476	Sue
477	All legs of the deal have been rebooked.
477	Susan
478	Deal is rebooked Susan
479	Sometimes I really worry about you...
479	I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I was rolling when I read your email.
479	It's a good thing I didn't send the other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your shack last night).
479	So how did you explain your attire this morning to your MD?
479	Hope the presentation was a rousing success.
479	Shorty
480	I think Ted needs to read this.
480	No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed.
480	No stream or gas drives anything until it is confined.
480	No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled.
480	No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined.
480	-Harry Emerson Fosdick
481	FYI.
482	I haven't sent a quote in quite some time, but this one really spoke to me.
483	First things first...
483	Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.
483	Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.
483	Mine was incredible!!!
483	I visited a friend of mine in San Diego and had the best time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony (on the water no less).
483	It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.
483	I'm certainly not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then I don't think he's bright enough for me).
483	Talk to you soon, Susan
484	Em, I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!
484	I'm sure it's just the first of many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.
484	I had an absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.
484	We went to the beach (where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the symphony and got messages.
484	All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.
484	Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new house in Hyde Park - very cute.
484	So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.
484	Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday morning.
484	You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes necessary for me to have a formal close to things.
484	I'm still hoping that will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief encounter with dating may be over for a while.
484	Sue
485	Here you go Cynthia...
485	Susan
486	Scott, Thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend.
486	As it turns out, I don't think I'll be needing them - My sister has extra tickets next to she and my brother-in-law.
486	Hope you have a great time and maybe I'll see you at the game (although given the crowd I'm not going to count on it).
486	Susan - - Looks like Saturday's going to be a balmy 90...better bring a sweater.
487	Lesli, Deals are rebooked.
487	Susan
488	Thanks again for thinking of me.
488	Lunch next week sounds good.
488	Any day of the week is fine with me as long as we get started around 11:30.
488	Just let me know what day is best for you.
488	Susan
489	Dolores, I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to the analyst program and how they affect me.
489	Specifically, I wanted to get some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements (as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the different tracks available within the program.
489	If you could direct to the proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.
489	Thanks, Susan Scott
490	I think we have a winner.

491	Gwen, Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.
491	I am currently half-way through my second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current rotation.
491	Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right direction to meet my current goals.
491	I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest convenience.
491	If there is another individual you feel would be a better contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well.
491	Thank you, Susan Scott

493	We use the ECC/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Enron subsidiary...not just Canadian deals.
493	So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada office.
493	Let me know if you need more information.
493	Susan
494	Cynthia, All of the deals below have been rebooked except for the one in red.
494	For some reason I can't find the counterparty in the system.
494	You may want to check and see if it has been set up yet, if it has let me know the proper name (I may be looking for the wrong counterparty) and I will rebook it as well.
494	Thanks, Susan Cynthia Gin
495	Christine, the "actual fuel usage" provision is probably a material deviation from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated in our tariff.
495	I have added language to this effect.
495	If we're using the "actual fuel" language because we anticipate that the fuel usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out and file a summary of the contract.
495	I do not think such a filing would generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.
495	Let me know.
496	An incident with a love partner throws you for a loop, causing a bit of deja-vu.
496	Dwelling on the past is wrong, wrong, wrong so don't!
496	Time to concentrate on the bounty of the present, tender crab.
497	I'm in. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
498	I was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the earth...
498	It is definitely good to hear from you, I was just thinking about you today and wondering what you're up to.
498	Things in Houston are pretty good.
498	I went to San Diego over Labor Day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just went to Austin this past weekend for the first UT football game (I know you're not a big fan but they are very fun).
498	As for work, all is well.
498	I'm actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up.
498	Of course my goal is to do a rotation in London for a year and then get promoted to the Associate program (so basically I'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what I need to do to ensure that outcome).
498	Honestly, I think my odds are pretty good.
498	Glad to hear everything with you is going so well, not that I'm surprised.
498	Congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up there (any trips scheduled to Houston in the near future?).
498	As for my social life...if you would of asked me a week or two ago I would have said fantastic, incredible, etc. Now, I just don't know.
498	For the life of me I am never going to be able to figure out your gender.
498	But as they say, "Hope springs eternal" and I intend to remain an optimist despite many road blocks.
498	Talk to you soon, Susan
499	Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.
499	I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.
499	If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.
499	?
499	Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract?
499	YES.
499	?
499	Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?
499	YES.
499	?
499	Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?
499	YES.
499	The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.
499	?
499	How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?
499	The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate.
499	If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's "negotiated".
499	Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.
499	We are not 100% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.
500	How about tomorrow?
500	I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format, by the way.
500	Should make getting a draft out easier.
500	Here it is if you want to take a look.
501	...try not to get the juice in your eyes, it really stings Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be kaput with Ted.
501	I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the other, it's just a vibe I have.
501	So I don't think you guys are going to have a chance to meet him while your in Houston.
501	Oh well, it was definitely fun while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.
501	I just want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my language but the description fits).
501	But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.
501	I hope all is well and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.
501	We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana Lafayette).
501	Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).
501	Simms started the game but only played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put some points on the board.
501	Simms did come back in the second half and through a touch-down pass.
501	The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys in the near future.
501	Write back soon, Susan ******** Humor is the best medicine.******** So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Beaver Creek and writing this on the back of it...
501	I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy T-shirt.
501	Dont'cha love it?
502	I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.
502	I really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality obligations.
502	I need to get Drew's clearance for Colorado law; I'll get back to you.
503	...okay, maybe it's not THAT good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful.
503	Hey everyone, Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.
503	I feel like it's been a while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed the interaction.
503	It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for it.
503	So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.
503	If it looks like 'a go', I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.
503	The one and only, "If we could just get everyone to close their eyes and visualize world peace for an hour, imagine how serene and quiet it would be until the looting started."
504	Christine, I made a few changes for purposes of clarification.
505	Hey Darren, Thanks for the prompt response.
505	Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings (especially since I still owe you a beer).
505	Glad you liked the quote, it does provide a good chuckle.
505	If I'd have known you were going to be in London this week I would have forewarned Katy and Emily as they're both over there now as well - I assume you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy.
505	Anyway, hope you're having a good time and not working too hard...
505	Susan
506	Hey Katy, Sorry no correspondence in a while.
506	I wish it was a case of no news is good news, but if you've spoken with Em recently you know that is not so.
506	Anyway, I wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to London.
506	I of course want to try and time it when both you and Em are in town.
506	So...I was thinking of flying out on Oct 4 and returning Oct 9, that way I would have a weekend over there with y'all.
506	I know you're planning a trip to Egypt around then so just get back to me and let me know if you'll actually be in London any of those days.
506	Hope all is well with you.
506	Talk to you soon, Susan
507	Thanks for the email.
507	Your candid comments make me wish I was over there right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.
507	I am in full agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put it, "He's just chicken-shit").
507	So, the plan of attack for the time being is none.
507	I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, no nothing).
507	Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be the true test.
507	You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good support system in Monique.
507	She is a firm advocate of the "drop him and make him work should he happen to come crawling back" school.
507	You know what really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about all the times I said "I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop." - well, it dropped) .
507	Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind of working.
507	I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.
507	You have to email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick would put me up - scarey).
507	Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.
507	FYI: The Longhorns beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.
507	Talk to you soon, Sue *** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a shortcoming on my part.
507	I don't.
507	Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I was, he freaked.
507	I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting aloof.
507	(Things that make you go hmmm.)
508	I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Christine and Bob and made them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.
508	According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.
508	I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection to our charging actual fuel.
508	However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.
508	Let me know what you think.
509	You crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your insight is frighteningly dead on).
509	Don't worry about me though.
509	I will be patient and remain optimistic, despite let downs.
509	And, in no way, shape or form will I settle and end up with some dush.
509	You would have been proud of me though, for the first time I was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more vulnerable.
509	I'm thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.
509	I think your attitude about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what happens when you care more about the other person than yourself).
509	Talk to you soon, Susan * Be sure and let me know next time you're coming to Houston.
509	We'll go grab a drink and have a good talk.
510	Hey Scott, Hope you had a good time at the game this weekend, despite the heat.
510	I just wanted to see if you were still interested in trying to grab lunch this week.
510	If you do, just let me know what day and time work best for you.
510	Thanks, Susan
511	Thanks Robert, this is a big help.
511	Just wondering -- you make the statement that "El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities..."
511	Do you think that our having an interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of saying this is not a CIAC?
512	Hi Mum!
512	What an eventful few days it has been.
512	Sorry I didn't call over the weekend.
512	I had my hands full painting my bedroom!
512	It took forever!
512	Luckily I got the color right on the first try: the Happy Yellow looks pretty good.
512	Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis tournament, which was fun.
512	It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the theater/art group I've been interested in joining.
512	In fact, yesterday I got a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!
512	I'm really excited and am expecting good news.
512	This could be an auspicious start to life after law for me!
512	Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.
512	It went by too quickly!
512	I hope you're having a good week; let me hear from you!
512	Love,
513	Cynthia, I had to adjust the NGI-Socal index price in the spreadsheet which resulted in a loss of $264,000.
513	Attached is the corrected spreadsheet.
513	Sorry for the inconvenience.
513	Susan
514	These horoscopes can not possibly be speaking to every Aquarian out there.
514	I'm convinced the author is someone I know...I would suggest it was my Mom, but her insight and advice would never be this good.
514	Aquarius For September 14: You have a knack for bringing people together and creating peace.
514	Part of your success in waging peace is derived from a desire to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe.
514	You're sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, and look forward to a refreshing sensation of starting anew.
514	Seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today.
514	What's stopping you?
514	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
515	Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.
515	If you have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty old.
515	I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!
515	The handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the A/C in the second bedroom.
515	If there's anything else you've noticed that needs fixing let me know.
516	Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.
516	Keep your freedom!
516	Stay in my apartment!!
516	If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to go month to month after Nov., that is fine.
516	All I ask is 30 days notice before you move out.
516	In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with you.
517	Sunday at 1:00 is good with me as well.
517	Just name the place.
517	See you guys then.
518	Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you Em.
518	Quick update: I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that I can at least spend a little time with Katy.
518	How will that work for y'all?
518	Sue P.S.
518	- Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted situation.
518	I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.
519	Please see the attached and let me know if you have questions.
519	If it looks OK to you and the 1/2 reimbursement arrangement is OK with EPFS, please forward to James Centilli for his review.
519	Thanks.
520	So who's up for doing something that Friday night?
520	I'll probably be in Austin Saturday for the football game, but am definitely interested in getting together with everyone.
520	Obviously this is planning WAY in advance for this group so we can revisit the topic when Wilson's arrival is a little bit closer.
520	Talk to y'all then.
520	Susan * Darren - Please tell me you have Wilson's keys...Margaret and I would be eternally grateful.
521	Do tell, Do tell.
521	Darren, What's the word?
521	So when do you head over to London and what pray-tell will you be doing over there.
521	I'm planning on going to visit Em and Katy around the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're going to be over there we need to all go out.
521	I don't remember if we ever talked about it or not, but I may try to do my third rotation there...the horror, Em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of London.
521	Anyway, I'm assuming congratulations are in order, so congrats on the new assignment.
521	Here are Katy and Emily's email addresses.
521	I don't have phone #'s, etc. as of yet but I could get them for you if you'd like.
521	I'll be sure to shoot off an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there.
521	Susan PS - We will definitely be doing Steak Night next week if you have any interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading credit derivatives in London...see how I'm hooking you up with all these connections) will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer.
521	Besides, it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper send-off from Little Woodrow's (Now I going to owe you a Bon Voyage beer as well as a birthday beer).
522	Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be in London for a few months working on a project.
522	When I mentioned you two were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.
522	No pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with one stone concept").
522	Sue Side-note: I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for a project and Ted is trading corn here.
522	Maybe I'll find out before Darren leaves.
522	Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.
523	Hey, Try lgillet@enron.com for Lisa's email address.
523	Glad to hear you're in the new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the futon offer.
523	Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a peep out of him).
523	I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.
523	On the one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't want to make this that easy for him.
523	I think I deserve more that just being swept under the rug.
523	So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all together OR do I try and get some resolution?
523	I would love to get a call from you hear at work.
523	The best time for me is probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.
523	Talk to you soon, Susan
524	Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to sending any contracts out.
524	It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.
524	I think it will work fine.
524	TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.
524	The difference between actual and billed amounts is very little.
524	Thanks for your attention to this last week.
525	Hi Misty!
525	How's everything?
525	Are we on for this weekend?
525	Let me know.
525	Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri.
525	night, I was thinking of flying in rather than driving Sat.
525	a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since you live so close to the airport!
525	Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend before last...drank a lot of beer also.
525	Am amazed it turned out as well as it did.
525	You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?
525	Apparently he used to live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!
525	I didn't think there could possibly be 2 Hamlets.
525	Small world.
525	Susan
526	Approved, subject to Drew's approval.
526	(Drew, the agency letter is the same as the one with Oneok, except we've omitted some meaningless language that Oneok had requested.)
527	Okay gang, it's time to rally the troops.
527	Evidently last week wasn't good for any of us to get together at our local watering hole (a.k.a Little Woodrow's)...but, I'm hoping the story is a little different this week.
527	Our own Nick Stephan is back in H-town for the week and has made a special request for a full-fledged "Steak Night" (that means good attendance).
527	Not that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company, steak, beer, etc. at LW's, but if I did I could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat.
527	Besides, given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying, the picnic tables and deck are beckoning.
527	I'm going to set a tentative meeting time of 7:30 p.m.
527	this Wednesday...get back to me at your convenience and let me know if we should stick with that time or not.
527	Hope everyone had a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).
527	Susan "When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading."
528	Hey Corey, So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?
528	Should I: A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.
528	I am completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the situation the last two days.
528	Help!!!
528	Susan
529	Fun quizzes from Cosmo...
530	That actually made me cry.
530	Susan
531	Be prepared...this one's a downer, but oh so true.
531	Email me and let me know @ what time you think you're going to try and call so I'll be sure to stay at my desk.
531	Sue
532	"The only things I need from anyone is love and respect and anyone who can't give me that has no place in my life"
533	Here are the email addresses again.
533	I'll shoot you off an email before I come over...hopefully, by that time you'll be somewhat settled and have a phone number where you can be reached.
533	Or, I may just see you at the office.
533	I have to pay a visit as there are a several people working over there now that I used to work with here (plus, I may try to set up a few interviews).
533	Susan
534	Christine, I spoke with Drew and he is OK with the changes shown in the attached.
534	Questions--let me know.
535	I have confirmations from Ben, Sunil, and Rudi.
535	Is there anyone else I left off the email?
535	Talk to you soon, Susan - - You'll have to come up and visit 32 at some point.
536	Kevin, let me know if you have any questions...
537	yo, I know.
537	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
538	Thanks for the advice/humor.
538	I'm feeling much better today.
538	I knew yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication or lack thereof would speak volumes.
538	(And his silence definitely said a lot) Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in said individual goes.
538	I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.
538	Oh well, so I'm single again.
538	Just think how incredible it'll be when I find someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing on).
538	So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?
538	Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the catagory I'd put Ted in right now).
538	Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).
538	I'm coming up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game Saturday.
538	I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love to sit with you.
538	Talk to you soon, Susan PS - Check out the list of individuals for our girls night out the Thurs...I don't think I'm going to go (I don't have enough time to waste on people I'm not that fond of)
539	Already done.
539	Susan
540	Attached is a memo addressing the question of whether TW could acquire capacity on a competitor pipeline in lieu of a physical expansion.
540	Please e-mail or call (x30596) if you have any questions, or if you would like me to set up a meeting to discuss this further.
541	Hey Wilson, Steak night is on...And, yes Darren really did give me your keys and I've already handed them off to Ben.
541	Also, you'll be interested to know that my parents might make it tonight for a little while so you may get to meet them.
541	See you tonight.
541	Susan
542	What time are you heading out today?
543	I'm soooo good.
543	The chosen path was cool, indifference.
543	So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing.
543	I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.
543	About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of someone.
543	Can you believe it?
543	He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.
543	Anyway, Kevin saw me and came over to chat.
543	He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this point".
543	The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.
543	He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc. I said there really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks.
543	Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head and cause a big scene.
543	When I said no, I think he was genuinely disappointed.
543	I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like much of a loss.
543	Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.
543	To go even further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".
543	He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't good dating material.
543	I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).
543	I then went on to say "Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".
543	Kevin: "Much bigger and much better."
543	About this time my parents showed up...the plot thickens.
543	I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.
543	The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when "dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.
543	He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eye-contact with me.
543	I give him a "hey" and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".
543	He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.
543	He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening.
543	The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for quite a while before going to join Ted.
543	My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished.
543	It really was a great night.
543	I would almost say I was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).
543	So, when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to say good-bye to Kevin.
543	It was awesome.
543	Ted's sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair.
543	Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even make eye-contact.
543	I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.
543	Needless to say I was very hung over today.
543	Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter ass-hole.
543	So I'm done.
543	And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces.
543	Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.
543	I bought my ticket today ( I think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - $450 before taxes).
543	I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.
543	I'm very excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.
543	I leave the activities in your capable hands.
543	( bear in mind I will have to see Darren and Nick at some point).
543	"Single again" Sue
544	In an effort to save a little time I'm forwarding you the email I just sent my friend Emily in London.
544	Get back to me if you would like me to expound on anything.
544	Turns out he's a real jerk.
544	Susan
545	Corey, Here's an update, I sent this to Emily earlier today.
545	Let me know about this weekend (i.e. the game, tomorrow night, etc. etc.) Susan
546	For your information.
546	If you have any questions, let me know...
547	It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the "Ted situation" - utter disappointment.
547	But yes, it is definitely his loss.
547	And, I loved the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).
547	I'm am very excited about my trip to London.
547	The other guy I mentioned in the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll get to see him there as well.
547	Plus, in November I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.
547	The globe trotting continues.
547	Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.
547	I wish I could be there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this weekend.
547	I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of them.
547	Talk to you soon.
547	Susan - - Deep down I think I knew there was something wrong with him.
547	I think that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, afraid of what I might find out).
548	Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make "operational" sales of gas.
548	Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain linepack levels.
548	TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine.
548	By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.
548	Let me know if you have further questions.
549	You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.
549	Here's a brief explanation.
549	Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.
549	I'm OK with eliminating "stockholders" and the "...judgments of any nature..."
549	clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a.
549	and b.
549	Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.
549	TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT standards.
549	Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in case of explosion, etc. In other words, both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and DOT standards.
549	(By the way, I believe the "notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the contrary" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.) Any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596).
550	I am refraining from responding to this until I have had time to ponder things this weekend.
551	Hey, If you want to email me back before Monday, you can email me at That way I can read your reaction even though I won't be at work.
551	Talk to you soon, Sue
552	I tell ya Mo, it's weird.

552	Issues that have bogged you down are effectively addressed.

552	Be direct and honest, without losing your temper.
552	Even if others misbehave, continue pursuing what you believe is right.

552	You CAN make improvements to existing paperwork, contracts, and agreements -- as long as you remain friendly, respectful, and well-prepared.

553	Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.
553	Things have been very emotionally draining for me around here.
553	I'm going to forward some of my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.
553	After you've had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your opinion.
553	Call or email with any insights.
553	Susan

555	HOROSCOPE: Weekly - His For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing things were different, or woefully mourning the past, build a new beginning.
555	It's pointless to bemoan recent changes or languish over disappointments.
555	You cannot change the past.
555	You cannot change people's minds, either.
555	Face your situation and create something wonderful.
555	The longer you fuss about what 'should have been', the more likely it is that important opportunities will drift by unnoticed.
555	Cancer, it is time for change.
555	Release frustrations and troubling memories.
555	Move on, Crab.
555	.
555	.
555	move on.
555	Mine for today Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding Once you've released toxic feelings, the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your pleasure.
555	You're able to replace fear and resentment with compassion and understanding.
555	Once you know the score, you no longer feel threatened or disrespected.
555	Keep revenge out of this entire episode.
555	'Teaching someone a lesson' is not appropriate.
556	Sorry for the delayed response to your email, but 10-11 a.m. this morning will work for me.
556	Just let me know the location.
556	Thanks, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
557	Gary, Just wanted to check and see how things were going for you on 44.
557	Hopefully you are now in possession of a phone.
557	If so give me a call, I would really like to get together for a cup of coffee or just a few minutes to enjoy the lovely weather outside.
557	- I'm confident Keri and Caroline are well.
558	FYI - Gary P. Nunn is going to be playing New Year's Eve at Gruene Hall.
558	On the Ted front...It's Tuesday afternoon and I haven't contacted him yet.
558	I'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that "a beer and a chat sound like a good idea, how about tomorrow night?".
558	I will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early enough or tomorrow at work.
558	This should all prove very interesting.
558	Susan
559	What's the word man?
559	I haven't heard a peep from you all day (even though I know you've seen Ben and called Kori...I'm hurt)
560	Julie, Just wanted to check and see if you had received my last two emails.
560	If so, I'd love to know what you think about the whole situation.
560	If not, let me know and I will resend the emails.
560	Susan
561	I haven't done anything as of yet.
561	I just really didn't feel like responding to him on Friday (I was still pretty floored by the whole thing) and since he's out of town till tonight I spent yesterday and today figuring out what I want to do.
561	I've decided the following...I'm going to give him a call tonight and agree to meet for a drink/chat.
561	I completely agree with you about regretting the things you don't do more than the things you do - besides I'm dying of curiosity about what he could possibly have to say.
561	Anyway, I want to try and do it tomorrow night so that I can quite turning it over and over in my head (I am absolutely sick of thinking about it).
561	I think it will be hard for me to be anything but distant talking to him because, regardless of his reasons, he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks.
561	Wish me luck!
561	(Problem is I'm not sure what I really want the outcome to be).
561	Susan
562	Part of me is tempted to do the "taste of your own medicine" thing, but I was really disappointed that he took that approach (in this case I think email is very cowardly) and don't believe two wrongs make a right.
562	I insist on taking the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach him a lesson.
562	Susan
563	I think this is for you.
564	Aquarius: The conjunction between the Sun and Moon is a wonderful symbol of togetherness and unity.
564	You may have been feeling distinctly out of sorts lately with your partner, and are sorely in need of some tender loving care.
564	Perhaps you both need to make the effort to be nice to each other.
564	I mean really nice, not just pretending.
564	See now, isn't that a lot better!
564	There's mileage in this one yet.
565	You forget that I also studied French, mon amie.
565	I may not be able to write it any more, but I can still read it.
565	Susan
566	Agustin, I just faxed a copy of the ticket to you.
566	Please let me know if it transmitted properly.
566	Also, the deal number is Q15463.
566	Let me know if you need anything else.
566	Susan
567	Yes, we still do the steak night thing, but I will be unable to attend this evening (dinner with the traders, oh la la!).
567	You may want to talk to bfree and see if he or Economou are planning on an outing.
567	So when are we going to have a chance to chat?
568	Alas, there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself.
568	There is good cause for your lack of enthusiasm.
568	Tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break.
568	How 'bout we shoot for around 9:30 (although I can do earlier or later if need be).
568	Let me know.
568	As for the week after next, anything from Wednesday night on will work for me.
568	I am in full agreement with you regarding a "solid dinner" (of limited attendance of course).
568	See you tomorrow, Susan - - Funny thing, Ben called earlier to see if I wanted to go grab lunch with him (Does he think I'm in a vulnerable/weakened state due to the Ted situation? Well, he's wrong.)
569	Agustin, I have booked the trades below into the ENA system.
569	The deal numbers are as follows.
569	Susan
570	Just talked to him...was pretty jovial...will probably get together tomorrow night...I think his job is REALLY stressing him out.
571	Just talked to him around 6:15 (don't know exactly how to take that)...he was pretty "jokey"...we'll probably get together tomorrow night...found out he has bought himself a pair of boots (ostrich - I don't think he's earned ostrich)...I think his job is REALLY stressing him out.
571	Sue - - There is a God and he likes me => Someone tricked Ted into eating fried cow testicles in Amarillo (he still sounded shaken up over the incident).
571	It's all about Karma.
572	Mine: For September 28: An agreement or legal matter improves today.
572	You are able to reach an understanding in a previously tense affair.
572	Do your best to maintain peace and tranquility, instead of giving into resentment or suspicion.
572	Behind the scenes finagling will be required to keep others on track and out of trouble.
572	Batten down the hatches during late afternoon and evening, and don't let any important info get into the wrong hands.
572	Someone may place their trust or future in your custody.
572	Make them glad they did.
572	Find weekly and monthly horoscopes His: For September 28: Something you already own or have access to provides even more satisfaction and enrichment.
572	Take advantage of this opportunity.
572	Squeeze every drop of juice out of a cosmic orange.

573	Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request that we provide "something in writing."
573	This is basically just a description of our proposal.
573	I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not reading while we're trying to talk to them.
573	It should be enough information to raise a lot of questions.
573	Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.
573	Everyone else: please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to provide something to them tomorrow.
574	Hi Mum -- not going to DC until next week.
574	Any ideas for Karin's birthday?
574	Maybe we could look for something this weekend.
574	I plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as I can!
574	Going to Brennan's tonight w/Craig.
574	Dianna isn't coming with me to Austin so I guess I will just come first thing Sat.
574	a.m. I'll give you a call tomorrow!
575	Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.
575	I did not go as far as I could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what capacity it can sell as firm.
575	Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.
575	If you think this passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.
575	My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as "firm" or "interruptible" since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except to assure us over the phone that it is firm!
575	I'd like to check to see if PNM is comfortable with all this before we file anything.
575	Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.
576	Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.
576	Also, the blanks of course need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
576	Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?
576	I know we probably do, and I may have even approved them.
576	But if possible I'd prefer to have two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.
576	It is not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to do anything.
576	If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two agreements, let me know.
577	Is that so?!
577	Well, I think you are quite a catch!
578	No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all Ted.
578	Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.
578	I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr.
578	old girl with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class than him.
578	Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified last night by Ted - 1.
578	By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2.
578	I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.
578	Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present "condition" could never be a match for me.
578	I would either always feel like I was carrying him or rolling over him.
578	I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now dated a divorcee.
578	Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?
578	I hope not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).
578	I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight (Singapore Airlines).
578	I found a great deal from San Francisco for around $580.
578	I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to $800, but it's still the best deal around.
578	I can't wait to see you guys.
578	Susan
579	Hey Darren, I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.
579	I talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a good night to try and get together.
579	I know you have a bunch of people that are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one big group outing.
579	Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set something up.
579	Susan
580	So I met him for dinner Thursday night.
580	Nothing was discussed until we were about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.
580	Turns out he was married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos. - sounds like a pattern to me).
580	We'll talk more later,
581	I think an original tasters gathering is a great idea...unfortunately, I'm going to be out of town Thursday (I'm visiting my friend Emily in London and I have to admit I am very excited).
581	If you guys do end up going have a great time.
581	Susan
582	Hey Ashley, Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London this Friday through next Tuesday.
582	I'm visiting a friend of mine who is attending Sotheby's graduate program.
582	I know it's short notice, but I would love to see you at some point while I'm over there.
582	If you get a chance email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can get a hold of you while I'm over there.
582	Hope all is well.
582	Susan
583	Shelly, Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.
583	Thanks, Susan
584	Attached is the final version of the Interconnect Agreement.
584	I've changed Section 4.2 in accordance with our e-mail discussion.
584	Additionally, I've filled in the blanks for POI# and date of commencement of construction, and added an Exhibit A (and a reference to Exhibit A in the definition of "Facilities") listing what will be installed.
584	Darin, kindly fill in the appropriate contact information on page 11, have the agreement executed by EPFS in duplicate originals, and return both originals to me.
584	I will return a fully executed original to you.
584	Lorraine Lindberg will be forwarding you wire transfer information for the payments that are due from EPFS upon execution.
584	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
584	Lorraine will be on vacation as of tomorrow.
584	Thank you, Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788
585	Hey, It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.
585	Did I mention I really need this vacation?
585	Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.
585	Is there anything special you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).
585	I talked to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.
585	If you want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.
585	Also, do you have any predictions for the weather.
585	I'm planning on bringing the following - jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, "rain coat" (I put it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some "go out" close, running shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.
585	I always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.
585	I'm assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home.
585	I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.
585	I also emailed Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend.
585	I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have much of a problem getting to your place.
585	I assume I'm going to want to get off at the Holland Park tube stop.
585	Should be a piece of cake, right?
585	Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?
585	I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat (i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).
585	See you soon, Susan - I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's "past" - maybe you can find out why the marriage ended.
586	Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize you'd called until last night.
586	I'm still at work right now and therefore am extremely tired.
586	Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this weekend.
586	I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for me.
586	There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still old enough to know who they are and what they want.
586	Some critical things happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that can expose so many "issues" (examples of which I got to see several of on Saturday).
586	Talk to you soon, Susan Are you and Doug going to OU?
587	I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to catch you "real time."
587	I went to the game Saturday with Travis, Corey, Mike and a friend of his.
587	Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.
587	Anyway, Trav's pledge class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.
587	The single guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.
587	Also, you've gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me (although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much younger).
587	I think 27-28 may be a better range.
587	Old enough to know who they are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached status on career focus.
587	Talk to you soon, Susan
588	Do you know where the Texas Exes watch the games in London?
588	It might be kind of fun to watch the OU game somewhere...even if just for a bit of it.
588	Just a thought.
589	I am very excited about my trip to London.
589	For one thing I get to visit Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work for 6 days straight.
589	You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one because you think you should) you should definitely get it.
589	Just think what a great conversation piece it would make over the years.
589	And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is impossible.
589	I can't wait to see you guys.
589	I think that you being in Korea and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder to deal with.
589	I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that they aren't as easy to get.
589	Love ya, Susan
590	Maria reminded me that we are required to file a rate case to be effective We could file one before then as to non-Current Firm Shippers, but I doubt we will.
590	Any other questions -- let me know.
591	Agustin, I haven't booked the origination we talked about yet because I wanted to get an exact number from you first.
591	If you could send me an email with the correct origination amount I can book it tonight.
591	The deal was with General Thanks, Susan
592	Here's the address for you.
593	Hey guys, Just wanted to drop a line and let you know that I'm going to be visiting London over the next 5 days or so.
593	I'm planning on swinging by the offices Monday morning to see everyone and just wanted to foreworn you all.
593	Hopefully, I'll get a chance to see you then.
593	Susan If anyone wants to get a hold of me you can leave a message on my friend
594	Lexi, I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting trip.
594	Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have been for you.
594	In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the hard copy to your office.
594	Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help with the process.
594	Thanks, Susan
595	Here you go Cynthia.
595	I feel pretty confident that everything is correct this month.
595	However, I'm sure I'm being overly optimistic on that front so call or email me with any changes.
596	Deal #Q15463 has been rebooked in TAGG.
596	Let me know if either of you need anything else.
596	Thanks, Susan
597	I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.
597	SoCal states that it has experienced daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.
597	If you would like a copy of the complaint, let me know.
598	given that I don't even know what UAF is, I will plan to attend.
599	Darin, that is fine.
599	Revised agreement attached.
600	In response to your question of whether Transwestern Pipeline needs to renew its bond (Bond No. 22000455) to the State of Oklahoma, the answer is yes.
600	If you have any questions, please call me at x30596.
601	Take a look at the attached and let's talk tomorrow if at all possible.
601	I want us to have a consensus among ourselves on this draft before I circulate it more widely.
602	I neglected to include some of Drew's comments in the version I sent you a few minutes ago...use this draft instead.
603	Ted, see the attached; I've made a couple of changes.
604	Hey girls, I'm back from London (the trip was incredible) and would love to see all of you this Thursday.
604	I hope we can all make it.
604	Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
605	Barbara, here is my draft of a rehearing request.
605	As I mentioned, our outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences; I haven't heard back from them, but will send you the revised draft when I do.
605	I'd be happy to copy Jay Golub too; please send me his e-mail address.
605	In the meantime, let me know if you have any comments.
605	We plan to file on Monday, Oct. 16.
605	Thanks, Susan
606	Trip was excellent.
606	I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.
606	I definitely thought about you and how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and proper).
606	I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll see.
606	I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am suffering a bit of jet lag.
606	Susan
607	Ashley, I am so sorry we never managed to meet up while I was in London.
607	Emily and I spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets, etc. and Monday I ended-up spending a lot longer than I planned at the office.
607	On the bright side, I was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few people while I was there.
607	I'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed by early next spring.
607	Hope things are well with you and the next trip I make over there we will definitely get together.
607	Susan
608	Hey Darren, Just wanted to say thanks again for including Em and I in the outing Friday night and joining us for dinner Monday.
608	Hope things with work are going well and that you're managing to reinvent the wheel without too many problems.
608	Cheers, Susan
609	Hey guys, Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).
609	Anyway, I'm so glad I got the chance to see all of you while I was in London.
609	It seemed as though all of you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.
609	Hope the approaching close to 2000 finds everyone in good spirits.
609	Cheers, Susan
610	Em, you know I'm in on this one.
610	It's been far too long since we've had a true NB weekend.
610	Unfortunately (although not surprisingly) it appears our erstwhile friend Alan will claim any excuse, no matter how unappealing, to avoid singing show tunes around the camp fire - your voice will be missed.
610	For the rest of you guys, I hope we can muster a good turn-out as I am in desperate need of over analysis in regards to the problems of the world as well as ourselves whilst in a drunken stupor.
610	Nobody does it better...
610	Susan
611	Jeremy, I saved the file so that the tab you open it up on is Larry's Gas Daily Option model.
612	Hey Julie, I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from the jet lag.
612	I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.
612	One of the guys I knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.
612	Since I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London Emily and I pretty much just hung out.
612	We went out to eat Friday night and then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish and chips).
612	Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.
612	Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.
612	Hope everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place was a success.
612	I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.
612	Susan PS - I think you're right about the California men.
612	I am currently in contact with about three of them and they all have issues.
612	Although, I still think Ted takes the cake.
613	The attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with FERC staff.
613	You will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets separately.
613	Please make sure you read the "Waivers" section towards the end of the document as it contains some additional requests for waivers.
613	Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all options, not just Shipper call options.
613	My previous drafts have provided for posting of Shipper call options only.
613	All other types of options will be generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.
613	My thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on our transaction reports required by Order 637.
613	Let me know what you think.
613	Let me know your comments as soon as possible.
613	I understand that the Commercial Group told Stan Horton this would be filed this week and Shelley reported at staff meeting on Monday that it would be filed this week or next week.
613	As soon as I get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.
613	Thank you.
614	You guys are going to kill me, but I just got a ticket on the floor for the Rockets game tonight.
614	I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.
614	I definitely want to see everyone and could "go out" later if anyone's interested.
614	Susan
615	Glad to hear things are going so well.
615	No, I haven't spoken with Ted since my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).
615	Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating material either.
615	In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his partners and maybe even fidelity.
615	He said the break up of Ted's marriage wasn't "ALL his fault", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted gave me the night of our chat.
615	I also heard that he has worked his way around Enron a bit.
615	All in all very disheartening information.
615	Regardless, I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole situation.
615	Tell Brendan I said, "Hello" and good luck with the new role at work.
615	Susan I have a hold on travel plans to Korea right now as work may interfere.
615	Oh, well.
616	I left him an extremely short voice mail thanking him for the book and asking him not to contact me again unless his message is kind and positive.
616	I tried to make my tone very pleasant and calm.
616	On Ann's and your advice, I'm going to rescue the shredded letter/envelope out of the trash; be careful what you toss in there.
617	Gotta love people finder.

618	Take a look at this and let me know if you have further comments.
619	Here is the latest draft.
619	If you have any comments, please let me know.
619	Thanks.
619	Susan Scott
620	That is correct, I returned comments to Accounting, not AA directly.
620	I don't think I sent my comments to Drew, but I don't remember very clearly.
621	Hey Em, Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.
621	I love this place!!!
621	To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering withdrawal.
621	I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure that though.
621	Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really don't know what to do about all of that) B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I haven't gone either night).
621	How ironic is all of this?
621	I've got one guy worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the reverse of that is true as well).
621	Talk to you soon, Susan Positive notes: I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the added stress of corn trading.
621	He looks old and pitiful.
622	Attached is the cover letter.
622	This version incorporates the changes we discussed over the phone on Friday, Stojic & Kelly's suggestions, and further revisions by Shelley.
622	(I've attached redlined and nonredlined versions.) Shelley and I might have a further revision or two with respect to footnote On Monday I'll be in meetings 9:30 - 10:30 and 2:00 - 4:00; otherwise I'll be at my desk.
622	Please fax me the final version of the tariff sheets when you have them (to 713-646-4095).
622	And, please call if there are any remaining questions.
622	Many thanks, Susan
623	Thanks
624	I am definitely interested in the parking space at the Met.
624	Please let me know if it is still possible for me to acquire a space.
624	Thanks, Susan Scott
625	FYI
626	Many of the customers have requested that we fax them the filing, so I am planning on providing them with courtesy copies.
627	FYI
628	Those were great Chris.
628	Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to London, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore swamped.
628	Mom said you guys had a great time in China.
628	I hope you took lots of pictures.
628	I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes again.
628	I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.
628	So, I'm going to see if there's a way I could come over next spring.
628	Regardless, I very excited about you and Chuck coming back to Houston in December and we'll just have to make up some quality time then.
628	Talk to you soon, Susan PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.
628	I mean honestly what goes through these guys heads.
628	They don't realize a "good thing" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the "good thing" is no longer interested.
629	You need to give me your messenger address so we can "talk".
630	Just thought you'd like to know that Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 stars.
630	He had many of the same comments to make about the film and Dallas as you.
630	Talk to you soon, Susan
631	I just got the email from our UT recruiter naming all of the Super Saturday candidates.
631	Kudos.
631	I'm so glad we didn't embarrass ourselves by overlooking you a second time.
631	I'll see what I can do about getting assigned to your dinner group.
631	See you this weekend.
632	Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from ARCO.
632	Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.
632	The pipeline system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.
632	The East Zone, which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.
632	The West Zone, wholly within California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.
632	Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July 28,2000.
632	An optional certificate application does not require any showing of market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of demand.
632	The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are "being negotiated" with prospective shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in both the East and West zones.
632	TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has been filed.
632	I have no further information about any further subscription of capacity.
632	I also have no information regarding any progress that has been made on construction.
632	If you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC, or if you have any other questions, please let me know and I'll see what I can find.
632	I've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need that for any reason!
633	Looks good.
633	Thanks for the heads-up, Susan
634	Chad -- Good to see you the other day.
634	Please give me a call when you return to your office.
634	I am embarrassed to say that I am not sure I have the right version of the Operating Agreement we sent you in March...if we can compare notes, I can make sure I get the correct one to you without further delay.
634	Thank you!
634	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
635	Colleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.
635	I definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.
635	Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very interested in seeing your suggested language too.
635	Please send your attachment "CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".
635	Again, thank you so much for your help with this.
635	(Calpine has finally woken up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...) I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.
636	For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job, health, and daily life.
636	Stressful matters beyond your control have leached away much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable.
636	Use this Mercury retro period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your health and lifestyle.
636	The resources and relief you seek are available, but you may be expected to kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need.
636	Are you willing -- or not?
636	I can't blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to compromise your vision.
636	But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 weeks to cook up an agreement you can live with.
637	Ashley, here's an ad in Word format.
637	If Deron could post it at Hewitt, I would be most grateful!
638	I just received word that I'm losing my garage apt.
638	renter as of Nov. 30...
638	If any of you know someone who is looking for a place, have them call me!!
638	(I found my current renter through a friend and it has worked out great.) Here are the specifics: 2 bedroom/1 bath garage apartment in Houston Heights (Cortlandt St.).
638	Hardwood floors, lots of windows, new window A/C units, washer/dryer hookup, garage parking space.
638	Cats OK.
638	$650/month.
638	Available December 1.
638	Call 713-853-0596 (day) or 713-864-4960 (evening).
638	Thanks!
639	Chad, attached is the draft of the Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement for Calpine's review.
639	As we discussed, because the exhibits are still being finalized, I have not included them in this draft.
639	If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
639	Thank you.
639	Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company
640	Attached pursuant to TK Lohman's request is an electronic copy of Transwestern's October 17, 2000 FERC filing proposing a transport options program.
640	This copy does not include the tariff sheets as they are not available in electronic format.
640	If you would like to see the proposed tariff sheets, please let me know and I will be happy to fax them to you.
640	If you have questions or comments about transport options, please contact either TK or me.
640	Susan Scott
641	Unfortunately I can't go to Austin next weekend; I've planned to go to L.A. to visit Sue.
641	I am bringing my new beau with me!
641	You will meet Craig at some point.
641	I think it's also safe to say you will like him much better than Bill.
641	I'm tentatively planning to come to Austin the weekend of Nov. 11, but you know that is totally up to D.E.
641	(Dreamy Eric).
641	In the meantime, send Bug photos if possible!
642	The counterparty is Nylon de Mexico and the contact is Alberto Diosdado.
642	The originator on the deal is Agustin Perez.
643	Marcelo, Evidently, there has been some discussion regarding the use of Enpower for Natural Gas basis options.
643	As a result I've been advised to hold off on any meetings until further notice.
643	Thanks again for all of your help and I will be in touch with you as soon as I know how we are going to progress.
643	Susan
644	I was just wondering if there was any more information available regarding the upcoming Super Saturday events.
644	I would be glad to help out in any capacity.
644	Thanks, Susan
645	Thought you'd get a kick out of this one.
645	By the way, did you guys end up doing the "holiday greeting" thing?
646	Both legs have been rebooked.
646	Thanks, Susan
647	Denise, a few weeks ago someone who is charge of computer stuff (in Omaha, I believe -- I cannot remember her name) called and we discussed replacing my 2 machines with a laptop.
647	Do you know who I am talking about?
647	I think I had you call her to give her info on my upstairs computer.
647	Anyhow, before we order anything it might be good to make sure she and Jeff Nguyen are on the same page about this.
647	Could you follow up on this?
647	Let me know if you have trouble getting in touch w/the right people.
647	Thanks.
648	I would like to reserve a spot at tomorrow's brown bag with Billy Lemmons.
648	Thank you, Susan Scott
649	This email is in regards to the Halloween party at the Continental Club.
649	I would like to confirm my attendance for the night of the Oct. 26.
649	Thank you, Susan Scott
650	I am planning to be out Friday, Oct. 27 and Monday, Oct. 30.
651	Did any of your traders do a deal with Larry May at Sumas selling half-a-day at +.03?
652	Yes, the deal would have been for today.
652	I'm not sure who the trader was and Larry has already left for the day.
652	I will probably just leave a note for him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.
652	Thanks, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.
653	I believe this email was intended for you.
654	I see no reason to acknowledge your presence given the way you are harassing me.
654	I no longer know you.
654	It is also not appropriate for you to tell me what is the right thing to do.
654	Please do not attempt to contact me again.
655	Hey Darren, Just thought I'd let you know that Billy Lemmons mentioned you by name in one of the Analyst/Associate brown bag lunches.
655	He was talking about the Ag Trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort (I think the other guy he mentioned was Jay Fitzgerald).
655	Anyway, thought you'd like to now you're definitely making a name for yourself around here.
655	Hope things are going well with you.
655	Talk to you soon, Susan
656	Your welcome.
656	As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.
656	I've been up in Austin practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social again.
656	There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.
656	Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this evening.
656	Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how convenient.
656	On the man front, I've put myself back out on the "market" so to speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know that in the end any of them will pass muster).
656	Unfortunately for them I am somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to let that color my opinion too much.
656	Not to worry about your former neighbor either, I haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay with me.
656	Drop me a line when you get the chance, Susan
657	I don't want to stop being nice, but I think it gets me into trouble.
658	It's muster - to pass inspection...(how does mustard make sense? It's not like the Grey Poupon commercials.) Main Entry: 1mus?ter Pronunciation: 'm&s-t&r Function: noun Etymology: Middle English mustre, from Middle French Date: 14th century 1 : a representative specimen : SAMPLE 2 a : an act of assembling; specifically : formal military inspection b : critical examination c : an assembled group : COLLECTION INVENTORY Get some rest, it's probably pretty easy to catch a cold with the damp, cold weather there.
658	Susan
659	Let me know what you think.
660	Here's the letter with some slight changes.
660	Drew and I thought it better to mention the interconnect for regulatory reasons.
660	Questions?
660	let's chat.
660	Thanks.
661	Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.
661	Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 million.
661	At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension: 155 million.
661	I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the relevant exhibits.
661	Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.
661	These are detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want to take a look).
661	The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.
661	Available capacity: 120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.
661	I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest.
662	Mike, as we discussed yesterday, please get a copy of the following exhibits to the "Happy Trails" application in Docket No. CP99-163-000: Exhibit K - Cost of facilities Exhibit N - Revenues, expenses, income Exhibit O - Depreciation and depletion Please send them directly to Lorraine Lindberg at EB4150G.
662	If you have any questions she can be reached at 713-853-5403.
662	Or -- I'll be here the rest of the day today.
662	Thank you!
663	So....Can you cover me for one night next week?
663	I could be back the next morning by 8:00 am.
664	No need to apologize for keeping me out Wednesday night, it was probably more a case of me keeping myself out (I have been known to do that on occasion).
664	I'm sorry I didn't return your call yesterday, but I had a pretty crazy day here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively cut me off from the outside world.
664	As for being upset about anything, don't worry I'm not.
664	You know me well enough to know that my actions are my own.
664	I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Austin Saturday night or not, but in case I do my cell # is 281-844-0866.
664	Susan I'll see you at Purvi's happy hour if you end up going.
665	The Post-Ted Susan is out of control.
665	In less than a week's time I have mugged down with 3 guys and have a fourth one emailing me to go out sometime.
665	Funny thing is I'm not really interested in any of them, just having fun.
665	Hope all well with you.
665	Susan
666	Don't know when you'll get a chance to read this, but I must confess it made me a bit teary eyed.
666	I didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent.
666	As for New Year's Eve, I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey.
666	As much as I'd love to see Gary P., I don't really want to risk the drive and I'm guessing no one else does either.
666	Hope you had a good weekend and I'll talk to you soon.
666	Sue
667	Hey, Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming the place is pretty close to our area of town).
667	I finally got into the parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car looking nice.
667	Hope things are well with you.
667	I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as though he is extremely busy these days.
667	I'm guessing the story's much the same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.
667	Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.
667	Susan By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU - one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.
667	Oh well, c'est la vie.
668	Kyle, I want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me.
668	I was hoping to be able to respond with the same kind of care and consideration you showed, but - as you can see from the time on this email - today has been a bit on the rough side.
668	I will continue my thoughts tomorrow when I have more time to gather them, but until then I wanted you to know that I did get the email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most touching things ever said to me.
668	And, please know that you would never, ever be put in one of my stalker catagories...you could never be lumped in any catagory with the SP's of the world.
668	Susan As for the good-bye, I would have to give it high marks as well.
669	Deal # Q47477 has been rebooked.
670	Thanks.
670	As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).
670	Halloween at the Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.
670	Susan By the way, you'll have to question the college coaches and sports writers out there if you have any issues with the rankings.
670	I am merely the messenger.
671	Week from HELL!!!!
672	Denise -- can you order this for me?
672	Let me know if you need any info.
672	I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down.
672	And a normal monitor & keyboard.
673	Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R. American is slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!
673	Ick!
673	There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
673	They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before COB tomorrow.

675	Attached is a draft of an answer to protests received in Docket No. RP01-56.
675	Please let me know your comments before noon tomorrow if possible.
675	Thanks.
676	Can we have a 10-15 min meeting sometime today before 3:00 p.m.?
676	Also, I've filled out the remainder of the login and password file for my information.
677	Deal #Q75558.2 - Counterparty is CIA Papelera Mandonado and the counterparty contact is Francisco Elosua.
677	Agustin Perez is the originator on the deal.
678	Stacey, I was wondering if there was still room in the brown bag today with Dan Reck.
678	If there are spaces available, I would like to add my name to the list of attendants.
678	Thanks, Susan
679	Let me know if any of the deals values in the attached file are incorrect.
679	Thanks, Susan
680	Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.
680	Let me know if you have comments.
680	I'll have a final draft out shortly.
680	Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding of Shipper call options.
680	The procedure will be as follows: an advance posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.
680	Shipper call options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option component.
681	Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read thru...if you have further comments let me know immediately.
681	Thanks.
682	done.
683	Jessica, I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using Information.
683	I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.
683	In fact, I fell asleep in the car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents decided to just leave me in the car.
683	I think I was probably out there for an hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).
683	Anyway, hope things are going well for you and Clay.
683	I know everything must be kind of crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the interviewing you've both no doubt been doing.
683	I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've had a good one in forever.
683	I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.
683	If not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if there's a good weekend for you.
683	Just drop me a line when you get a chance and let me know what's new with you.
683	Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
684	Count me in for tomorrow's brown bag lunch with Berney Aucoin.
684	Thanks, Susan Scott
685	Thanks Carrie.
685	I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be properly reflected next month.
685	Susan
686	"Kitty Fun Barbie" Complete with Marshmallow the cat (with long, brushable fur), cat toys, little cans of Fancy Feast, and, get this: a carrier thaqt becomes a litter box!
686	"Marshmallow drinks and wets in the litter box. Scoop up the clumps after she goes. So real!"
687	Hey Kyle, You'll be happy to know that I think I finally caught up on all of the sleep I've been missing out on of late.
687	Last week was extremely trying at work, I think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs.
687	between Monday and Friday, and thus resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.
687	Anyway, I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before embarking on your new career with Valero.
687	I'm sure your decision to leave Enron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.
687	In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together before you leave.
687	Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late (monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.
687	However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.
687	Just let me know what works for you.
687	Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey (i.e. me).
687	Susan
688	Marcelo, Thanks for the update.
688	I have been given a green light as well to go ahead and start testing my traders deals.
688	Let me know if you just need TAGG deal numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel models.
688	Thanks, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
689	Sagittarius Sagittarius Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship should be very interesting.
689	You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying, activist/adventurers.
689	Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find someone else to do it for you.
689	This union requires periodic reality checks.
689	You share each others ideals, interests and adventures like no one else can.
689	Both of you like to read, study, observe, learn and teach.
689	When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but never boring.
689	Travel is part of the glue that holds you together.
689	So here's a warning: Separate vacations are a no-no.
689	Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back -- or remain at home.
690	The Star Diva has spoken!
690	I believe she is correct in everything but the last part...if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself, I know you would come back.
690	And I would miss you while you were gone!
690	I cannot imagine wanting to go on a trip without you, and I don't consider myself a "wanderer," either.
691	Here's the service list
692	Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated Shippers' protest.
692	Please provide comments as you see fit.
692	I will probably not have time to look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, conclusion, etc.).
692	In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including identifying those that might be safe to ignore).
692	Thank you!
693	CONGRATULATIONS !
693	I just found out that you were extended an offer by the Big E. I can't tell you how happy I am that I didn't have to question the intelligence of my company.
693	Hope you had a good birthday and I'll see you at the A&M game.
694	Denise, please put these meetings on my calendar.
694	Thanks.
695	Hello Dave.
695	My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting, but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.
695	Best regards, Susan
696	Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the PNM capacity docket.
696	As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the summer months.
696	The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to consider our request.
696	In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're doing well so far.
696	There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our request.
696	I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.
697	Gregory, The book code is XZP for all of the Basis option deals.
697	The book code does not change month to month, it is always XZP.
697	Thanks, Susan
698	Thanks for the attached deal information, Shouan.
698	Looking at the data I feel confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily options curveshift is valuing correctly.
698	However, I am still concerned with the valuation from 10/31.
698	Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 11/3 for 10/31's position.
698	If you could send me that information in the same format I think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall out of my trader's book on 11/1.
698	Susan
699	Low blow with the "weekends are my time..."
699	comment.
699	Anyway, Friday should be cool so just go ahead and give me a call in the afternoon and we'll go from there.
699	Susan - - Gas prices up almost $.50 in two days...it is a madhouse around here.
700	Get me a ticket and I'll see what I can do...I call later.
701	Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
701	Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 (about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.
701	However, if it's inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.
702	Ted, I made one addition.
703	Hi Mum!
703	So good to see you this weekend!
703	It was great to meet Eric; what a sweet man.
703	Fun too!
703	I can see why you are so crazy about him!
703	Craig realenjoyed meeting you also.
703	Our trip home was somewhat hair-raising but we made it back safely.
703	I can't believe I am still here at work!
703	Took a break to make my list foryou.
703	It is somewhat random.
703	Feel free to collaborate with K&J...
703	Love, Sooz - CD case (small -- for 12 or so CDs out of their boxes) - small duffel bag to take to the pool (smallest Eddie Bauer, or Nike alsomakes a comparable size) -- really need this -- any color except all-blackSee: www.eddiebauer.com/eb/product.asp?product_id=3D17368&nv=3D5|214|231 - sleepwear -- all kinds -- size XS usually fits best - travel coffee mug - Clinique "Happy" body lotion - Amazon.com wish list - Bag from Kenneth Cole ) see website (www.kennethcole.com) (style =3D "Ladies Night" in black.

704	Stacey, Please include me on the list for Tuesday's brown bag with Jen Fraser.
704	Thanks, Susan
705	Here is a draft that incorporates Drew's, Steve Stojic's, Maria's and some of Shelley's comments (Shelley hasn't gotten all the way thru the draft yet).
705	Please take a look at the draft and let me know if you have comments today.
705	Still working on justifying transporter options, as you can see on page 5.
705	If possible I'd like to send it to Nancy to file today.
705	Thanks, Susan
706	Agustin, I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can be properly assigned in TAGG.
706	The ticket for the deal in question reads Barcel Mexico.
706	However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.
706	If you wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct counterparty name it would be much appreciated.
706	Thanks, Susan Deal Parameters - Costless Collar Deal Date: 8/24/00 Delivery Point: Avg (IF-TETCO/STX and PGE) ENA Sells: $5.20 Call ENA Buys: $4.00 Put
707	Nancy and Mike, please sign the attached and file it today, and deliver copies to those staff members who got copies of our initial filing.
707	Please fax a signed copy to Denise LaGesse at 713-853-5425 and she'll do the service list mailout.
707	Any questions -- give me a call at 713-853-0596 (fyi - I have a meeting from 11 to 1 but will take a break to check messages).
708	Glen, as we discussed, here is the negotiated rate TW deal which TK did today under Rate Schedule ITS-1.
708	The term is ONE DAY, Nov. 15.
708	I know this is a bit unusual.
708	We are just going to have to ask the FERC for a waiver of their "before gas flows" filing requirement.
708	Given the price spreads and the shippers' willingness to pay more than max.
708	rates for short-term deals, we might have more deals like this.
708	We probably need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when this happens.
708	It would be so much better if we were able to send tariff sheets via e-mail to our D.C. office.
708	Call if you have questions or need anything.
709	p.s.
709	the tariff sheet we need to file is 5B.05.
710	Mary, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy Statement and found the following language: "A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated rate at the time it intends the rate to go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the Commission will readily grant requests to waive the 30 day notice requirement."
710	I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to file on the same day.
710	This reinforces my belief that our waiver language is fine as is.
711	Still need to add a few things, but most of it's already there.
711	The only things missing are the GD files we created and the GD FOM valuation problem that I've been working on with Shouan and Jeremy (there was a bug in the code).
712	Ted -- see minor changes on the attached.
712	Try to get them to agree to Texas law.
712	(Might help to point out that our interconnect agreement with Calpine as well as any transport agreement will be governed by Texas law.) Thanks, Susan
713	Any interest in doing something tonight?
714	On November 2, 2000, the California PUC issued an Order Instituting Investigation into the adequacy of Sempra's, SoCal's and SDG&E's planning of SoCal's and SDG&E's gas transmission system and what measures should be taken to correct any deficiencies.
714	The parties have been ordered to appear and show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating that: - SDG&E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year.
714	If such supply is not adequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate supply.
714	- SDG&E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need for gas-fired electric generation.
714	If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply.
714	- SDG&E's gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by interests of its corporate affiliates.
714	- Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting supply for SDG&E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with representations to the Commission.
714	- SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not, SDG&E shall propose changes.
714	A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November 22.
714	Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the response is filed.
714	The Commission also ordered SDG&E to evaluate whether an interim, interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter.
714	If so, SDG&E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration.
714	The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by SDG&E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric generation customers.
714	The Advice Letter was heavily protested and was withdrawn by SDG&E.
714	In my conversation with Mark Baldwin regarding our pending consulting agreement for monitoring California regulatory matters for Transwestern, I asked him to watch for Sempra's Nov. 22 filing and to advise whether he believes Transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is to be scheduled.
714	I will follow up with Mark, and provide you with a copy of the filing.
715	Edwards Greenway The Legend of Bagger Vance Will Smith helps Matt Damon find his lost swing in "The Legend of Bagger Vance."
715	Will it be an ace or air shot?
715	Remember the Titans In "Remember the Titans," Denzel Washington stars as a high school football coach tackling racism in the 1970s.
715	Pay It Forward In "Pay It Forward," a boy tries to set his teacher up with his alcoholic mother.

715	River Oaks Billy Elliot Boxing and ballet don't make for boyhood bliss in "Billy Elliot."
715	Try saying that three times fast.
716	I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the leasing office closes.
716	I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any necessary papers.
716	My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.
717	Hi Maria Victoria!
717	I'm planning to be there right at 12.
717	At the entrance they usually have a table where you pick up your name tag; we can meet there if you like.
717	See you soon!
718	Mark: Please review the attached agreement, which is similar to what was in place before.
718	I have not included specific projects in the agreement, but at the outset, consistent with our conversation the other day, we will need you to monitor the following proceedings and provide us with updates and copies of any orders or presentation materials: - Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding (I.99-07-003) If you have any questions, please give me a call.
718	If the attached is acceptable to you, please print it out and sign it, and return it to me.
718	We look forward to working with you!
718	Sincerely, Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 Houston, Texas 77002
719	From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?) I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.
719	Sagittarius and Sagittarius When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures makes theirs a near perfect relationship.
719	This couple views the world around them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more knowledge.
719	They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and banter that challenges and tickles the mind.
719	An occasional hotheaded dispute can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic Sag partner carries things a little too far.
719	Easygoing and independent, these two are compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests.
719	They've never known jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with their lover.
719	When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing their partner and satiating common interests.
719	Although they are adaptable and modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle.
719	However, it is not in the Archer's nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long.
719	Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck).
719	Expansion is the key word here; as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over exciting ideas into their relationship.
719	They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as such gluttony will only distract them.
719	Their charm and charisma make them a very pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.
720	First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that used to be IT.
720	It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.
720	A receipt point has now been specified: Bloomfield Compressor.
720	Our tariff allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated us down to only one day.
720	TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.
720	Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
720	I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.
721	Demetrius, what I nice e-mail!
721	It was great to see you too.
721	Unfortunately I have a really busy short week this week; we are trying to get something filed at FERC.
721	If you're in town next week do give me a call or e-mail.
721	I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving!
721	Susan
722	Strangely enough a Tuesday night would probably be better for me too.
722	I think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well know, I'm up for anything.
722	As for restaurants, I just tried this new place called Bossa's and it was really good.
722	It's right across from the Rice Hotel downtown and has a neat atmosphere.
722	Of course there are also all kinds of places around our "area of town" that would be great as well...PF Chang's, Mi Luna, Americas, La Griglia (sp?), etc. etc. Just let me know the time and place.
722	Thanks again Lisa for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.
722	Susan PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or tomorrow night let me know.
722	I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever.
723	Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.
723	As far as "free nights" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.
723	Katy and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL margaritas.
723	I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever they may be the drinks are on me.
723	(Although given your increased tolerance these days, you may break me).
723	The reason I was asking about when you were coming home is...Jeffy Jeff is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).
723	Plus, if we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.
723	Talk to you soon, Susan PS - I have encouraging news regarding London, I'll tell you more about it when I talk to you.
724	Like I was saying the other night, there are a lot of funny emails going around these days...
725	Travis thought you'd get a kick out of this...
726	Thought you'd like this one...
727	Hey Wilson, Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through March of next year when my current rotation ends.
727	Everything's going pretty well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard work is going to pay off.
727	In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty good right now.
727	There might be an opportunity for me to get into some structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).
727	Glad to hear things are still well with you.
727	Sounds like you're still the same old Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.
727	You'll have to let me know when you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.
727	It looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.
727	I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but nothing really to speak of.
727	I was kind of on a rampage over the last month just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving them my number and then completely ignoring them).
727	I think it was some need I had to treat your entire gender like shit.
727	I'm pretty much over it though.
727	It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary thing for having been treated like crap myself.
727	Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.
727	Susan
728	Hey Darren, It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this morning.
728	He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.
728	Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some cold ones.
728	So H-town for six weeks hugh?
728	Why the mixed feelings?
728	Are they work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?
728	Anyway, I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what it's all about but then again maybe not.
728	So what's with this Kiwi girl?
728	Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.
728	Turns out there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going versus the other opportunities I was being offered.
728	Either way, I won't be going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.
728	As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really to speak of.
728	I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see them going anywhere.
728	Most of the guys around my age are still pretty insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.
728	And the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.
728	Oh well, as I've said before "hope springs eternal".
728	Talk to you soon, Susan
729	It sounds great...we'll figure out a good time then.
729	I've really missed you guys these last few weeks.
729	I've been completely MIA.
730	I completely forgot to call you this afternoon...it got kind of crazy around here.
730	If you're going to be at the flat any time tomorrow shoot me off and email and I'll call you in the morning, ....otherwise I'll talk to you tomorrow when you get to H-town.
731	Hey Julie, Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more than earned it).
731	I just wanted to drop a line and see how work, your new apartment/roommate and Brendan are all doing.
731	All are wonderful I hope.
731	I realize this is somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of Dec. 15?
731	I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.
731	Regardless, this deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it doesn't look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a visit mid-January or February.
731	Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.
731	Susan
732	I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.
732	The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests.
732	I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.
732	Please call or e-mail me if you have questions.
733	FYI.
733	Jan, I know Shelley's out; I left her a voice mail.
734	Couple of minor changes.
734	Looking good!
735	Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.
735	If that works for you I'm going to go ahead and book the ticket now.
735	I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.
735	As for myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.
735	Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.
735	I think it was more of an ego thing on my part.
735	Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.
735	I'm not taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed respite.
735	Let me know about the times.
735	Susan
736	Does anyone know this person or his organization?
736	Is this something our membership might be interested in?
736	Frankly I have been too busy to think about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.
736	Susan Scott
737	Here are a couple of deals to look at.
737	Thanks, Susan
738	Drew -- I worked with Jeff on this draft so it already contains my comments.
739	This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it directly to Drew and Maria.
739	How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about corporate etiquette?
739	I wonder.
739	On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.
740	for bullets
741	As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some reading and here are my thoughts.
741	The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.
741	Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect.
741	The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but "fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.
741	Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable...
741	In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer.
741	The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.
741	"Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.
741	As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.
741	However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable.
741	The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their electricity bills.
741	The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.
741	By contrast, TW's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice.
741	It is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over.
741	However, as you and I have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.
741	We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals.
741	Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.
741	Drew, obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report.
742	Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.
742	Unfortunately, I'm not a betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I can't vote against my alma mater)...so I will kindly refrain from any wagers.
742	Have a great Thanksgiving Holiday, Susan The options book is still the options book and I think I will have put in at least 36 of my 40 hours this week.
742	I know, I know...I'm not working hard enough,
743	Hey Chris, I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment complex can send you some info.
743	regarding getting your name taken off of our lease.
743	If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass it along to them.
743	Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving and all.
743	I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with both of our parents and extended family members.
743	Have a great holiday and root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).
743	Love, Susan
744	For your information.
744	The outcome was great for TW because the Cal.
744	PUC adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.
744	The outcome is not so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.
744	The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of the competing settlements.
744	I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have questions.
745	Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT good.
745	Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm right.
745	With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.
745	My condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .
745	Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie co-workers through this trying time.
745	Susan (Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are an "Ag" man now.)
746	Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes effective Dec. 1.
746	(Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks ago).
746	The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy.
746	The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation.
746	The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract provision is described.
746	Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance).
746	I have a conf.
746	call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want to give me a call.
747	Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.
747	As for the bet, if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as an enabler.
747	And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.
747	Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference opponents is really helping to ease that blow.
747	Speaking of feather's in the conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the Big 12 - will wonders never cease.
747	My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to type that much ).
747	UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go, "Like rats fleeing a sinking ship?"
748	It was very small and petty of me, but I couldn't resist.
748	Start with the last message and work your way up to get the full story.
748	Good luck studying, Susan
749	Start at the bottom and work your way up....I'd forgotten this is how I get over guys, flush-out the shortcomings of their wit.
750	Lindy -- FYI.
750	This is just really informal so I'd prefer you not forward to anyone yet.
750	Drew and Maria are most familiar with this so I'm going to get their feedback first before setting up a meeting.
750	I'll get with you before I set a meeting time to see when you're available.
751	I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist and was always coming up with theories herself.
751	I'd concluded that breasts were to sex what pillows were to sleep.
751	"Guys might think they want a pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one."
751	She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."
752	I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."
752	How weird is that?
752	Anyway, hope you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly.
752	I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, I'll know more about my London prospects.
752	Susan
753	Charles Bradley Scott....hope the wedding plans are still going well.
753	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
754	Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.
754	The next earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way I could make that one because of work.
754	The other option is to fly in Saturday morning like I did last time.
754	I'm leaning towards leaving Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up to let me in. That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 6:00).
754	Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various options?
754	Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.
754	Susan
755	Okay...My itinerary is as follows: Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15 pm.
755	If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.
755	I am so excited to be coming out there - - I really need a break from Houston...not to mention work.
755	The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would love to meet your friends.
755	Also, please don't feel like you have to plan the whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.
755	See you in a couple of weeks, Susan
756	I am free for lunch on 12/4.
756	I'll see if Frazier's available.
756	Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.
757	Hi Ashley!
757	A couple of things.
757	First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees that may apply).
757	I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference you in when he makes the calls.
757	For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or the other.
757	Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, in case you were wondering.
757	I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean anyway!).
757	Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund next week.
757	Merci!
757	Susan
758	CurveView Parameters Risk Type: Price (P) Source: NG_OMICRON_1,2,3...etc Curve Type: Volatility Percent (VO)
759	Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch with her.
759	I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking.
759	Remember I have water covered.
759	Call or e-mail if you have questions!
760	Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could probably muster up the energy.
760	Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.
760	Do I need to do anything to sign up for the run?
761	The deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.
761	I'm going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations.
762	If you could run the same valuation for Deal #'s QC1431.1 and QC1431.2 using Post-id 956785, we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +/- .
762	Call me if you have any questions.
762	Thanks, Susan
763	Well, how does it feel to be back?
763	I'm sure, even though our fair city can't compete with London for history and culture, there are a few things you've missed about this place.
763	Hope the flight back was good and I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.
763	Susan
764	I believe Leslie does regulatory/legal work for ENA on a contract basis.
765	Frazier tells me he's available.
765	How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on Kirby @ Richmond?
766	Let's plan on Friday before Christmas!
766	And Craig will join us, I'm sure.
766	Please stay over at my place that night.
766	That way you would not have to worry about driving all the way back to Tomball after partying downtown -- and we'd get to visit longer!
766	Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office.
766	It is a big drag.
766	Sheila came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, and had to be hospitalized!
766	I think I should count myself lucky I only have the office bug.
766	She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to Austin.
766	Sounds like she is feeling a lot better.
766	We're having a surprise party for Craig's 40th on Friday!
766	I don't know whether he suspects anything...
766	Time for more cough medicine!
767	I'm dialling in from home -- got the bug that's going around the office.
767	I'll call you in a few...
768	Jeff -- good wrap-up.
768	May I forward to MKM and Drew?
769	Great minds....
770	FYI
771	Noon to 3 our time...
772	Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tarifffiling unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy thatrecourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allowto charge market based rates.
772	The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove laof market power.
772	A warning: lack of market power is very difficult to prove.
772	Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack market power, tried and failed.
772	The deck is already stacked against us inTW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and theprice conditions in California.
772	However, we do need to analyze the possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal.
772	border, then on other parts of oursystem.
772	Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipperto pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.
772	Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?
772	Please let me know.
772	Ithe meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.
772	To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information showing it meets the requirements outlined below.
772	If the Commission findsall requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then mathe appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
772	Application for declaratory order must include: 1.
772	Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate treatment.
772	I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.
772	2.
772	A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect tothe services at issue.
772	The Commission requires a narrow definition of themarket("firm transportation" is probably narrow enough, but for our purpwe might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of Thoreau). We have to define substitute services available to shippers(opipelines are a "good substitute" only if shippers can obtain the same quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer suchservice at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than 10%. All relevant "origin markets" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)as well as "destination markets," and alternatives for shippers in those markets identified. Transportation alternatives are only good alternativesif they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if theyused TW. Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a goodalternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract quantity. 3. Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant competitive factors. Commission looks at size of market share, mitigatingfactors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point adelivery point. HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share andsquaring it. There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportationservices because of the expense involved in constructing facilities. 4. Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues.
773	The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.
773	If I don't here from you via email/msngr by the end of tonight I'm going to forge one and fax it to them.
773	Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't mind.
773	Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.
773	Hope things are going well.
773	I actually worked 21 straight hours the other day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
774	Also, there was a confirm that came in Friday with Amerex for you Buying 1/day BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call Option at $0.26.
774	The counterparty was Cinergy...Let me know if this is a good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.
774	Thanks, Susan
775	Received your message.
775	Do we want to file a response to PNM's protest?
775	It basically contains the same arguments they launched at our 637 filing, and we did not file an answer to that.
776	Dan, I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.
776	While dealing with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.
776	The documents and contracts seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.
776	Still, I wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather than simply discard them.
776	If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is limited up here).
776	Thanks, Susan
777	Kevin -- I've looked at the pooling agreement and I agree with you -- I don't believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement.
777	Any further questions, let me know.
778	Please include my name on the list of attendants for the brown bag tomorrow.
778	Thank you, Susan Scott
779	Call me with any questions.
779	I'll send you the final version when I have the official NGI settle prices.
779	Susan
780	Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and coughing up green/yellow stuff.
780	No fever at all, though.
780	I go to the doctor tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.
780	Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.
780	But I wanted to double check with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?
780	The reason I am asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece fabric and comes in a v-neck style...
780	I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.
780	The last thing I want to do is buy her something she does not need!
780	Will stick to my pedicure gift certificate idea.
780	So glad you are doing better.
780	Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!
781	Sorry Beatrice, I sent this to Greg and forgot to send it to you as well.
781	This is a preliminary file until I have the official NGI settle prices for Chicago City Gate and Socal.
781	Let me know it you have any questions.
781	Susan
782	Hey Lisa, Good job on the organization.
782	Do you have any recommendations for what I could bring or is there anything you think we really need?
782	Also, just to double check, we're getting together next Monday night right?
782	Susan
783	Here are some of the main curves....attached is a file containing the rest.
784	Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I raised last week?
784	If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and I'll schedule something around them.
784	Thanks.
785	Hey guys, Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a Pre-party spot.
785	The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her boyfriend and Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.
785	Don't know if you guys have any interest, but the offer's open.
785	Either way, we'll have to find someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).
785	Susan
786	We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.
786	The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.
786	I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.
786	What exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??
786	Can someone help me with this?
786	Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.
786	However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.
786	Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and fuel" provision.
786	If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.
786	However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.
786	Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.
787	Someone booked the entire Rainbow Lodge for a party this p.m.
787	As alternatives, Chez Sooz recommends: La Mora Brennan's Please advise.
788	Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.
788	I am leaving on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I go.
788	Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc.
789	I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA.
789	I'm with ETS Legal.
790	Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.
790	It is still in draft form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to you now so that you could start working on it.
790	We would like to have the new company formed today if possible.
790	I will let you know if I make any changes to the attached.
790	In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have questions.
790	Susan Scott
791	Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline Company.,
792	The deal has been rebooked.
792	Thanks
793	Hey Bronwyn, I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).
793	Glad to hear things are going well with you.
793	It was so neat to run into you in Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think he recognizes me.
793	I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next time I see him.
793	So what's new with you?
793	Have you moved?
793	I know you were thinking about LA a while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out there and are really having a good time.
793	Anyway, I completely understand the urge to try something new.
793	I too am thinking of making a move before next summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I really need to experience something different).
793	Speaking of which, Emily is in London going to graduate school right now.
793	I've already been to visit her once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.
793	I would actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.
793	As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.
793	I was seeing one guy for a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos.
793	into things to tell me he has issues and that he'd been married before.
793	Needless to say, that was pretty much the end of things.
793	It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.
793	How about you?
793	Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch with.
793	Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she graduates.
793	Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas when she graduates.
793	Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a fellow med student there.
793	Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is living and working in Dallas.
793	Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely perfect for her.
793	That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.
793	Talk to you soon, Susan
794	Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 will be held on Jan. 9 at 10:00.
794	A notice will be issued shortly.
795	That was too cute.
795	How's your week been going?
795	I can't wait to come out next week...it will be so nice to get away for a while.
795	Susan
796	Don't you have work to do??
797	You planned that didn't you.
797	You guys can't get enough of me.
797	Enron Capital Management
798	It's compensation for poor self-esteem...Oh wait, I don't have poor self-esteem - You're right, Big Ego!!
798	Enron Capital Management
799	You guys better brace yourselves...there are some real doozies.
799	I keep waiting for HR to just show up one day and fire us all ( her for telling the stories and us for listening).
799	Enron Capital Management
800	I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA; I'm with ETS Legal.
801	Martha, I don't have any bullets but could you please send me last week's -- I think there are some old ones that need to be deleted.
801	Thanks.
802	Here are the curves: GDP-CAL BORDER GDP-CHI.
802	GATE Thanks for all of the help, Susan
803	THanks..I have no revisions.
803	Enjoy the party!
804	Transwestern Transport Options: A technical conference is being scheduled for January 9, 2001.
805	OK, here's my 2 cents' worth: Avale Corp. I also like Enable.
805	I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...
805	Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.
805	But I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.
806	Basnea Corp. Basne Energy Management
807	This document contains both the El Paso and TW information.
807	I'll bring you the printouts of the relevant El Paso tariff provisions.
808	Just so you can see how this is evolving...
808	I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
808	I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.
808	When they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).
808	That is really the only information she still needs from us, I think.
808	I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.
809	The book code is ALWAYS - XZ.
809	As for trade dates, that is not one of the fields I fill in for the exotics spreadsheet and I don't think that's something we'd really want to add as the file already takes up an extremely large amout of memory.
810	Hey Alicia, Katy's email address is katyhester@hotmail.com and her phone number is (281)351-5669.
810	I know she would love to talk to you more about travelling - she has a lot of great ideas about places to go, things to see and things to do.
810	See ya, Susan
811	The only one I'm still not really sure about is Stanfield, which is in red.
812	As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and try to maintain my friendships via email.
812	You all know me well enough to know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).
812	Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special things.
812	So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note and let me know what's new in your life.
812	Love you guys, Susan Jennifer - Hope work is going well.
812	I know this time of year has got to be crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.
812	We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.
812	I'm in need of a good chat.
812	Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about to pull your hair out.
812	Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).
812	Please tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.
812	Lisa - Hey sweetie!
812	I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, but Jen said it went really well.
812	We need to get together soon I've missed seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings ons in your life.
812	Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set just like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.
812	Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the "Fam".
812	Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your Mom) is absolutely in love with him.
812	Keep me posted on your plans for the future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).
812	Also, I thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in your old hometown - Chicago.
812	Any thoughts?
812	Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at myself for letting that happen.
812	Please write back soon and let me know how school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely out of touch) are all doing.
812	My guess is you're going through exams as well right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.
813	Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than never, right?) Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table as well).
813	But Laura was right, Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is that?
813	- so she'll make sure I know what's going on.
813	Can't wait to see you guys, Susan
814	I am destined to be a dork....it's in the genes.
815	Have to agree with your assessment.
815	And, I promise she will try like the dickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things with you.
815	Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.
815	He came over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.
815	Me in a wing-back and Lisa and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.
815	This is the second time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had to witness the "cuddle fest."
815	Not to mention the "cuddle fest" we all witnessed with Chad at Europa.
815	Maybe if she does come over you could be the little red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.
815	She's in heat right now I swear.
815	Every 5 sec.
815	there's some new guy she thinks is hot.
815	The guy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.
815	She's totally out of control.
815	I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik probably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.
815	It's really pitiful you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.
815	Did I mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she was of course performing the role of social butterfly).
815	Like I said, it's pitiful.
815	In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her "friends" that have met Mitch and think he's all right I'm pretty sure everyone else has told her they think she can do better.
815	I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at least by her) as a complete push-over.
815	Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette.
815	Can you believe my parents?
815	They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs and took a roll of film...what dorks.
815	Sue I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me.
815	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" <ehille|
816	I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.
816	Just a thought.
816	If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.
816	Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.
816	Susan
817	FYI: Trish Murphy is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night....thought you might be interested.
817	Drop me a line.
817	Sue
818	Starts at eight....would love to go, at least for a while.
818	I'll give you a call later to discuss.

819	Best Product Placement: Taking corporate sponsorship to absurdly intimate levels, Pepsi spokesdiva Britney Spears wore a tiny medallion with the soft-drink company's logo in her bellybutton ring during her much hyped commercial.
819	Although, considering the amount of money the company has sunk into her, it may have been a homing device.
820	Hi Shannon, Could you be sure to remove my name from the distribution and replace it with George Huan...he has taken over my roll running the options book.
820	Thanks, Susan
821	Thanks Shannon...I appreciate all the help you've given me over the last year and would be happy to return the favor in the future if there's anything you need.
821	Good luck to you as well in your own endeavors.
821	Susan
822	He was over again last night.
822	Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.
822	I simply do not understand.
822	I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.
822	Where's the fun in that?
822	I just think it's weird.
822	Talk to you later, Sue
823	Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.
823	I'm still up for this evening if you are.
823	The "show" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.
823	Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.
823	I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.
823	See ya later, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Jennifer Bowles" 03/26/2001 11:19 PM
824	Hey Katy, I was just curious if you had any interest in attending the reception below.
824	Sounds like it might be interesting to me.
824	Drop me a line and let me know if it sounds like fun and I'll go ahead and get a couple of tickets.
824	Talk to you soon, Susan 2001 Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Corporate Partners Spring Reception, April 3!
824	Be a part of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston 2001 Corporate Partners Spring Reception on Tuesday, April 3 at Law building of the MFA.
824	Enjoy great food donated by ARIES Restaurant and The Redwood Grill, free drinks, cool art, and good friends.
824	To attend or with questions call (713) 639-7585.
825	I know, I know.
825	It's still weird to me.
825	While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.
825	I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.
825	That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.
825	I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.
825	Seems more like "good buddy" to me.
825	I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.
825	On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.
825	I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.
825	I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.
825	It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.
825	I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.
825	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 03/27/2001 09:36 AM
826	I believe this was intended for Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas trading.
826	Thanks
827	I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.
827	What pray tell will she do?
827	With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?
827	I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.
827	She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.
827	She's got such a tough life.
827	Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about Lisa always dating someone....she still denies.
827	Cracks me up.
827	Response is always, "I've only had two serious boyfriends."
827	To which I've started to respond, "We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy. In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon."
827	I definitely need this vacation, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 03/27/2001 09:59 AM
828	So transparent....I will pay you good money to hook-up with this guy.
828	Would get hours of enjoyment from such an event.
829	You can take me off this distribution as I am no longer with risk.
829	Thanks, Susan From: Larry Joe Hunter 03/27/2001 11:04 AM|
830	I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.
830	I'll try and give you a call later today.
830	I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.
830	It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something.
830	Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Katy Hester" 03/27/2001 12:26 PM
831	Hi Jennifer, Yes, that is correct.
831	I would like to contribute $25 in addition to the $50 membership fee.
831	Thanks for getting back to me and verifying the amounts.
831	Susan Scott Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Knight, Jennifer" 03/27/2001 12:54 PM
832	Civil War may be sold out...I'm checking on it.
833	Julie, I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.
833	I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.
833	I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.
833	I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.
833	All in all life has improved.
833	Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.
833	I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.
833	I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.
833	Like I said before, I'm up for anything.
833	Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.
833	Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.
833	Talk to you soon, Susan
834	Yup...I leave for the Caymans today.
834	Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.
834	I am, understandably, very excited.
834	We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.
834	As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.
834	The going away party for Kenny should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly.
834	Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.
834	See ya next week, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Katy Hester" 03/28/2001 10:13 PM
835	Hey Lisa, Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.
835	Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).
835	As for the "Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.
835	I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?
835	Love ya, Susan PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long.
835	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Lisa.A.Meador@chase.com 03/28/2001 12:28 PM
836	the Cayman Islands We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.
836	I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.
836	Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).
836	Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.
836	Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.
836	We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.
836	Sue
837	I'm leaving shortly for the airport, but I will give you a call when I get back so we can discuss transport to SA.
837	I am way too excited about this trip (many pics will be taken).
837	Susan I completely agree about foregoing the Mucky Duck Tuesday...too cold and too rainy for me.
837	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Jennifer Bowles" 03/28/2001 02:58 PM
838	I believe this was intended for the Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas Trading.
838	Thanks
839	I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.
839	If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).
839	I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.
839	Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.
839	Susan
840	Hey, Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.
840	Take my advice though...use sunscreen!
840	I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.
840	Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.
840	So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.
840	I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.
840	My how things have changed.
840	I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.
840	She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.
840	All in all things are pretty good.
840	Talk to you soon, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/01/2001 04:48 PM
841	Hey, Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.
841	I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.
841	So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).
841	Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.
841	I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.
841	See ya, Susan
842	Earl, Long time...no nothing.
842	How goes it?
842	Just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing.
842	Hope all is well.
842	We really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours.
842	Talk to you soon, Susan
843	Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?
843	As for dinner, I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference.
843	I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.
843	I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here.
843	Talk to you later, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Lisa Gillette 04/02/2001 11:31 AM
844	Theresa and Nicole, Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.
844	Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.
844	As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.
844	Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet: If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.
844	Thanks for all the help, Susan
845	Just got the email myself...will definitely check it out.
845	Thanks
846	When you get a chance, tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July.
846	I'm trying to figure when I can come visit and not pay too much on airfare, be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work.
846	I will definitely come over...just don't know if it'll will be when Katy does.
846	Sue
847	If you're on the internet right now, I'm trying to call...our meeting was postponed.
848	Here you go....Katy wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the "reception" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.
848	Let me know if that works for you.
849	Yes, I am going home before the reception and am going to have Katy meet me at the apartment around 6:15 (at least that's what time I'm telling her).
849	If you want to tell Laura to meet at the apartment around that time too, I will be there to greet her.
849	I'm going to drop off some dry cleaning, finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there.
849	I'm so glad everyone is up for this outing...we are so culturally aware.
849	So that's the plan.
849	I suggest we eat somewhere around the Museum District...I'll do some research this afternoon.
849	Talk to you later, Sue
850	Okay, I'm in for driving together on Friday.
850	Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.
850	So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.
850	I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.
850	Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.
850	Talk to you later, Sue
851	Lexi, I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.
851	My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.
851	Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.
851	Thanks, Susan
852	Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.
852	I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.
852	I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).
852	I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?
852	The trip was incredible.
852	My life has done an absolute about face.
852	Can't wait to tell you all about it.
852	Talk to you later, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Jennifer Bowles" 04/03/2001 10:27 AM
853	Hey stranger, Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?
853	The trip was absolutely incredible.
853	We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.
853	Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.
853	I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.
853	After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.
853	Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.
853	My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug.
853	Talk to you soon, Susan Hope Law Review isn't wearing you too thin.
854	I promise I have not forgotten about you.
854	Things around here have just been crazy with the beginning of the month and all.
854	I should have some time tomorrow to get together if you like, just give me a call.
854	Talk to you soon, Susan
855	We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.
855	There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?) As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.
855	Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.
855	I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.
855	Plenty of time to do something interesting right?
855	Sue I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight.
855	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/03/2001 01:25 PM
856	Hey buddy, Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?
856	I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.
856	Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right?
856	Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?
856	I promise not to run too late.
856	Talk to you soon, Susan
857	You should check out the 2nd deal...there are also trips to Cayman etc. on the same link at great prices.
857	See ya Saturday, Susan
858	You're gonna love this site.
858	So true.
859	There is only one Susan Scott at Enron that really matters, right?
859	Best ways to ensure it's me...either use sscott5@enron.com or check to make sure the middle initial that pops up is "M".
859	Ciao
860	Hi yourself, I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.
860	Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about my visit.
860	I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.
860	Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.
860	I'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay? ).
860	No worries about the need to study.
860	I've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.
860	Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal.
860	My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40 Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as tired).
860	Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more than ready for a little R&R.
860	Love, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/09/2001 10:26 AM
861	Hi Ashley, It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.
861	Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.
861	I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.
861	However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.
861	I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.
861	Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.
861	I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).
861	I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.
861	Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies...
861	I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together.
861	Talk to you soon, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Ashley.Marynick@chase.com 04/09/2001 03:19 AM
862	I'm flying Continental and I will check my mailbox for the card...I haven't checked it in a while.
862	I'm going to bring my pictures from the last two weekends ( very fun activities...I tell you all about them this weekend).
862	Love ya, Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/09/2001 11:10 AM
863	So do you have any ideas/plans for brunch on Sunday...my guess is there are a ton of places with special Easter Brunches.
863	I just thought maybe you had a regular spot.
863	Let me know.
864	Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.
864	No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.
864	I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.
864	Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).
864	Just a thought.
864	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/09/2001 12:20 PM
865	Thanks for the info...I will check into it.
865	Hope you manage to get some rest.
865	The wedding was fun, super sweet and huge (800+ at the reception).
865	I got hit on by a waiter at the rehearsal dinner and groped in the hotel elevator by one of the groomsmen...so I'm up on guys right now.
865	Talk to you soon, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/09/2001 01:17 PM
866	Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.
866	Oh well life is short, right?
866	I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.
866	I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.
866	By the way, how long are you going to be there?
866	Susan Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing.
866	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Mary Rebecca Harp" 04/09/2001 04:41 PM
867	Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing.
867	I figure we'll be engaging in the following activities: beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I think you mentioned something about a museum.
867	Given those various situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.
867	For instance, am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?
867	Also, let me know if you hear anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time. We could go for a run in the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.) Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.
867	As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions...
867	George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar. All of these, with the exception of Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically).
867	All of the places mentioned above, in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded good for just regular meals.
867	Depending on local culture (and your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.
867	I didn't know what time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night.
867	I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.
867	In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help out with a few suggestions.
867	Love, Susan
868	I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful.
868	As for baseball, I'd love to stop by for a few innings on Saturday.
868	It sounds like fun and I wouldn't mind checking out the stadium.
868	I can't stress enough how flexible I am on all this stuff.
868	We can wait a while before deciding which is our best beach day bet.
868	I'll check out the spa's schedule regarding massages to see what kind of flexibility there is there.
868	As for the clothing I will try to remind myself SD is casual...Houston's gotten pretty sassy over the last couple of years.
868	I always feel underdressed when I go out here.
868	Thursday night sounds great...two days and counting.
868	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson <julieg@qualc|
869	Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.
869	Either works for me.
869	The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.
869	Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?
869	(The lady at the spa recommended the second one) Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress.
869	You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil.
869	After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion.
869	Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.
869	Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.
869	Time: 90 minutes Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub.
869	You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.
869	Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.
869	Time: 90 minutes Ta Ta, Susan
870	Hey Kasey, I just got an email back from KJ and he seemed to think you're going to be in San Diego until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in San Diego.
870	I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.
870	If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.
870	I've got your number from your last visit to Houston so don't be suprised if you hear from me.
870	Talk to you soon, Sue
871	Ditto
872	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas Trading.
872	Thanks
873	Ditto
874	Ditto
875	Ditto
876	Never Enron Capital Management From: David Baumbach 04/11/2001 09:18 AM
877	Hey Julie, Just wondering if you had any preferences regarding the spa times I emailed you yesterday.
877	If you get a chance let me know and I will go ahead and make a reservation.
877	Ciao, Susan
878	I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.
878	I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.
878	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/11/2001 01:38 PM
879	Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.
879	Be sure to tell everyone I say, "Hello!"
879	As for the zoo, I am a huge fan.
879	It's the only zoo I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.
879	It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.
879	Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.
879	Sue Em's in the Canary Islands this week...can you believe that little brat?
879	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Kasey Walker" 04/11/2001 02:47 PM
880	I would like to be placed in the new garage.
880	Thanks, Susan M. Scott
881	I had some difficulty replying to the parking & transportation email and just wanted to make sure that you received my request for a space in the new parking garage.
881	Thanks, Susan M. Scott
882	I couldn't agree more...Happy Holidays!
882	Sue Paul Harvey writes: We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse.
882	For my grandchildren, I'd like better.
882	I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches.
882	I really would.
882	I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.
882	I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car.
882	And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.
882	It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep.
882	I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother.
882	And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him.
882	When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him.
882	I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely.
882	On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.
882	If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one.
882	I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.
882	When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.
882	I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
882	May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.
882	I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it.
882	And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.
882	I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle.
882	May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.
882	I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand.
882	These things I wish for you through tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness.
882	To me, its the only way to appreciate life.
882	Send this to all of your friends who mean the most to you.
882	We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.
882	Do You Yahoo!?
882	Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
882	Mail.
883	Thanks Sarah.
883	That was very touching.
883	I just forwarded it to a bunch of people...too good not to share.
883	Hope you have a happy Easter!!!
883	Love, Sue
884	Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).
884	I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.
884	However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.
884	That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc. What do you think?
884	I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries.
884	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/12/2001 11:06 AM
885	Call Ambrosia ?
885	Monday morning
886	Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.
886	It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.
886	Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.
886	Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.
886	Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.
886	I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.
886	I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.
886	Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.
886	I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.
886	Talk to you soon, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "corey leahy" 04/12/2001 04:06 PM
887	Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Houston.
887	Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the pina colodas, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than pina colodas I assure you).
887	The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.
887	I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar. There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.
887	I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.
887	It forced me to the realization that the men in Houston, and much of Texas, are soft.
887	Alas, no exciting stories though...
887	Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with Susan's tails of woe.
887	There is definitely ample material.
887	Sorry to hear about Ben and the girlfriend.
887	I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go.
887	Talk to you soon, Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/16/2001 03:53 AM
888	So...the weekend I was talking about coming to Austin the following people are playing: Fri The Fabulous Thunderbirds Gruene Hall Fri Cory Morrow Luckenbach Dance Hall Sat Reckless Kelly Antone's Sat Lucinda Williams Gruene Hall Just more food for thought.
888	Sue
889	Hey Lisa, Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.
889	I'm sure it was a blast.
889	The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.
889	I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.
889	Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).
889	I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.
889	I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.
889	I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.
889	Thanks, Sue
890	I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Houston time (713-775-6472).
890	Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?
890	I love this job.
890	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/17/2001 10:55 AM
891	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas trThanks
892	Sounds good to me.
893	Any interest in going to the Rockets game tonight.
893	I have free tickets and it may be Hakeem's last game.
893	Let me know.
893	Sue
894	Thanks for the help!
895	Phillip, Here's the power point presentation with updated information.
896	Are you sure you have the right Susan Scott?
896	If this is for Click at Home, I've already received my computer.
896	Try the Susan Scott with legal...her extension is 30596.
896	Thanks
897	Sorry about the last email...hadn't read this one yet.
898	Wrong Susan again...try typing sscott3@enron.com (that's her short email address)...mine is sscott5@enron.com.
898	If you see the middle initial "M" pop up in the address, you've got the wrong Susan Scott.
898	Thanks
899	Hey girls, Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.
899	I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.
899	Personally, I think this is a really good price.
899	I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.
899	We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.
899	Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.
899	I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.
899	Talk to you soon, Sue P.S.
899	Katy...my friend Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.
899	I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions.
900	Check out the Southwest website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.
900	I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.
900	That way I can spend more on food and drinks.
900	We can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip.
900	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/18/2001 11:25 AM
901	What's the scoop golf-pro?
901	Are you in for tonight?
901	FYI: The weather is gorgeous outside.
902	I hate forwards...but I do like champagne.
903	I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.
903	The retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting.
903	My mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representative of Ted's sex like dirt.
903	Fortunately, my behavior was very short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing.
903	I wouldn't worry about the lecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just utter flapping as in my case).
903	Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your friends...that whole like attracts like thing.
903	As for the email from Clint, he's a cutie.
903	Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were you though...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get the impression that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.
903	However, if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's a great guy.
903	Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in a couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same way...something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did oWell, I'm off to Vegas this weekend. My guess is I won't be getting much sleep. Oh well, life is tough. Susan Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson <julieg@qualc|
904	I think it's probably a good idea not to contact Eric for a while.
904	Truly what purpose would it serve?
904	As for my work situations, they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me.
904	I'll tell you about them on my next visit.
904	See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.
904	Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.
904	I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.
904	To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.
904	Enough self-analysis.
904	Have a good evening....you should his jazz night at Epizote just for me.
904	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Julie Gibson 04/18/2001 04:15 PM
905	Are you going to be in Austin next weekend (the 28th)?
905	I'm thinking about making a trip up there to visit.
905	Let me know.
905	Sue
906	Sorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night, but I hope you had fun at steak night.
906	It's too bad you didn't make it to Sierra's ( you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly).
907	Congrats on the promotion.
907	I was a little suprised it was only to manager...I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director.
907	All things in due time, right?
908	I feel okay...just regretting some of my actions from last night.
908	Oh well, life goes on.
908	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Lisa Gillette 04/19/2001 09:17 AM
909	definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.
909	He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).
909	I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.
909	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Lisa Gillette 04/19/2001 09:27 AM
910	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott (sscott3@enron.com)...I'm with nat gas trading.
910	Thanks
911	I think this is for you.
912	Ditto....
913	I guess there's some sort of fine for dating...sounds like a load of BS to me.
913	What's your AOL messenger name?
913	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Lisa Gillette 04/19/2001 09:50 AM
914	Next week sounds good to me too.
914	If everyone wants to meet at Ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work.
914	Susan had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result.
914	I can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either!!!!
915	The email was titled "nothing bad..."
915	so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.
915	I know you can't get enough of that stuff.
915	As for the revenue generation, I've heard what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.
915	From what I understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good work!
915	And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case.
915	Your welcome for the email.
915	I really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ....." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity - okay burgeoning maturity).
915	In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it.
915	I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows.
915	Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Portland.
915	So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.
915	No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things.
915	In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.
915	Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.
915	And I think I either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtle but important difference.
915	Shorty - You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think I may have frightened some people.
916	Like I said...I'm in. What time is "right after work" for everyone?
916	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Ashleastu@aol.com 04/19/2001 11:18 AM
917	Had a bit of an encounter with Ted last night.
917	Turns out it wasn't as bad as I thought it was based upon the email below.
917	Start from the bottom and work your way up.
917	FYI he's kidding about the MD (managing director) and God comments.
918	I'll see you guys there.
918	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Ashleastu@aol.com 04/19/2001 03:00 PM
919	Hey there, Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.
919	As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.
919	I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.
919	I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.
919	I've been needing a good Austin fix.
919	The trip to San Diego was awesome.
919	We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).
919	I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.
919	I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!
919	Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight.
919	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Mary Rebecca Harp" 04/19/2001 11:24 AM
920	Vegas baby!!!!!!!!!!!
920	I can't wait...our flight arrives around 6:00 and then we head back Sunday morning.
920	It's a "work" trip.
920	Will do on pitching the 12th to the gang.
920	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Mary Rebecca Harp" 04/19/2001 03:44 PM
921	Try hard...
921	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Jennifer Bowles" 04/19/2001 04:33 PM
922	Give me a call whenever you get in...
923	Vegas trip was pretty interesting.
923	Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.
923	Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - If I'd spent any longer than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.
923	I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am.
924	Either option sounds good to me.
924	Just send an email with the time and place when you guys figure it out and I'll be there.
924	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sarah Berry 04/23/2001 01:03 PM
925	I had some appetizers the other day at the MFA that were provided by Aries and they were very good.
925	Definitely wouldn't mind trying that place.
925	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Jennifer Bowles" 04/23/2001 02:38 PM
926	Congrats!....Lisa told me the good news last night.
926	Can't wait for the big day, I know you guys will be very happy together.
926	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Laura Jahnke <ljahnke@aero|
927	I'm sure she knows you're CC'd her on the email...she wants you to witness the flirtation.
927	She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.
927	I told her I sent it to him.
927	She said, "I didn't think you knew his last name?"
927	To which I responded, "I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address. I'd promised him at Kenneally's that I'd send it when I got the chance."
927	Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.
927	I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.
927	Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the "let's just be friends talk" last week ( which I think was the right move ).
927	Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.
927	Nothing bad, just a good little story.
927	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "Emily Hillegeist" 04/24/2001 03:50 AM
928	Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).
928	Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion: I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.
928	On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).
928	The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.
928	Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.
928	I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.
928	Sue PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.
929	Hey girls...I hate this, but I may be out Thursday.
929	Please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes I'll meet you there.
929	Otherwise, have a great time and to both Lisa and Jen, I need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal ( both are very good things and I love good things ).
929	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sarah Berry 04/24/2001 11:11 AM
930	I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.
930	I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I?
930	And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.
930	One of those things you'll never really forget.
930	I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things.
930	Sue Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "corey leahy" 04/24/2001 02:47 PM
931	I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.
931	What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility.
931	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "corey leahy" 04/24/2001 03:07 PM
932	I was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.
932	If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).
932	I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to Lisa about this and I need a co-conspirator.
932	Sue
933	that's okay...i'm used to it at this point thanks
934	Are you still alive?
934	I'm just checking b/c I haven't heard a peep out of you in a while.
934	Drop me a line and let me know what's up.
935	What happened to you last Wednesday?
935	Were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew?
935	Hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well.
935	I just dropped the Earl a line to see if he's still breathing.
935	I'll let you know if I hear anything back.
936	Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.
936	I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.
936	As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.
936	Needless to say it was a big night.
936	Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have "get-up-and-go" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).
936	I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.
936	Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.
936	I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.
936	Cheers I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on...
936	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Tobin Carlson @ EES 04/25/2001 03:35 PM
937	I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
937	I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.
937	I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.
937	You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.
937	I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).
937	I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.
937	Love, Sue PS - Are you coming in for Deborah's wedding?
937	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: caycie.c.ayres@accenture.com 04/25/2001 04:23 PM
938	No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.
938	Friday may a happy hour option though.
938	Sue This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me...
938	so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?
939	Disregard the last bit of the previous email...I tracked down a ride.
940	Hi DeShonda, I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.
940	Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.
940	Thanks, Susan M. Scott
941	I think there was a problem when I tried to send this before...so here it comes again.
942	looks like the curve was marked around 9.0625 for jun/sept...but you'll have to talk to keith holst to get an absolute price
943	George, You'll be taking the May'01 Options out of the file today (Monday) and adjusting the P&L to reflect the May option value.
943	Stop by if you have any questions.
943	Susan
944	I believe this message was intended for the other Susan Scott.
944	I'm with Nat Gas trading.
944	Thank you.
945	Sure....I probably won't be able to come by until after lunch though.
945	Susan
946	Here you go....
947	If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.
947	I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.
947	Susan
948	i'll stop by while making my rounds this afternoon.
948	and, you'll have to get someone else to tell the stories...i don't remember much of friday night and, as a result, susan had a "come to Jesus" meeting with herself this weekend.
948	may be the last of the truly good stories involving me for a while.
949	no problem...i've been good, just busy with the new job.
949	all of the sudden i actually have time to do things so i spent the last weekend just trying to get my life re-organized.
949	not a very exciting weekend, but extremely necessary.
949	what's up with you?
950	Ditto
951	yes, that time works fine for me...i was wondering what happened to you.
951	i had emailed you after you left the message in houston and never heard another peep out of you.
951	hope things are going well and i'll talk to you around 3ish.
952	This is for the other Susan Scott....I sit on 32.
952	Thanks
953	No problem...it makes me feel important.
954	Hey Julie, I just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to New York went.
954	Las Vegas was way too much fun...so much so it's quite possible I did permanent damage.
954	I managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing.
954	Hope everything's good with you and I'll talk to you soon.
954	Susan
955	Any chance either or both of you could get together this week for coffee, dinner, ice cream, etc.?
955	Also, are you all going to Deborah's wedding?
955	Talk to you soon, Sue
956	Adriane, Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.
956	Just one of those things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.
956	I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.
956	Hopefully, I'll find the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will be able to stick to the new limit.
956	Thanks again, Susan
957	Again...you've got the wrong Susan Scott.
957	You might try sscott3@enron.com...that's the address I use to forward things to her and it seems to be workThanks
958	yeah...i should be.
958	talk to you then.
959	Hey Paul, Jay's already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid.
959	I'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if I don't talk to him before then.
959	Thanks, Susan
960	yes
961	Hey Em, Hope the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.
961	I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).
961	Nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.
961	When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.
961	They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.
961	To top everything off, he's moving back to Houston in three weeks...ughh.
961	Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.
961	Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.
961	Ta for now, Sue
962	Finally met Ashley Mace's man Saturday...ran into them at the cd store.
962	He's seems nice, but not at all what I would've expected and/or pictured.
962	It was strange to finally have a face to put with the image I'd conjured up.
962	Ciao
963	I would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great.
963	I just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work, so 6'ish is probably best for me.
963	Let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk.
963	Lisa, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and Brad dancing at the reception.
963	Anyway, drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet.
963	Sue
964	Would love to get together again sometime, but I'll think I'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go...I was the champ - though ultimately of what I'm not sure.
964	Frightening as it is I felt fine on Saturday, however from what I've heard that wasn't exactly the case with Bass.
964	Thanks again, Susan (You'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come)
965	That's great.
965	I look forward to the day.
965	By the way, are you coming in town this weekend for Deborah's wedding?
965	Sue
966	you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.
966	Congrats on "the move"...O'Neal told me the good news.
967	They should if they are dealing with transport, gas daily options, etc. which are effected by the omicrons.
967	I would typically go to the leads of the respective regions, tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use ( a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use).
967	If the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble!
968	Lupe, I found a couple of checks that were for expense reimbursements.
968	They are past the 90 day period.
968	What can I do to have these checks reissued?
968	Thanks, Susan Scott
969	This is the engineer you wanted me to give a shot...
969	Let's bear in mind our initial meeting was before Christmas and I've never agreed to meet him....yet he still persist.
970	I can only hope I'm not the only one he's showering with attention...
971	Hey guys, Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.
971	If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.
971	I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).
971	I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.
971	As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston.
971	I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.
971	The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.
971	Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.
971	It was a completely surreal experience.
971	Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.
971	Speaking of the new job, things are going well.
971	I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.
971	There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.
971	I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.
971	So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role.
971	I had a pledge sister's wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another "sister's" wedding this weekend here in Houston.
971	I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.
971	Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.
971	I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.
971	Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.
971	I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.
971	Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.
971	Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.
971	We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.
971	Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.
971	I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.
971	I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.
971	I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.
971	I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.
971	What the future holds?
971	- I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.
971	And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.
971	September is also an option if that works better for you.
971	I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.
971	Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.
971	Hope the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon, Sue
972	my new cell # is 713-775-6472
973	I'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.
973	Despite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.
973	Susan By the way, do we have a particular time in mind?
974	I'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience?
974	Europa, the shrubs across the street?...and it wasn't 2 hours, more like an hour to an hour and a half.
974	Besides, I think Bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god (at least I had the good sense to just pass out when I got home).
975	oh, it's on!
976	Alright guys, you have to know we're kidding.
976	I don't think either of us are going to be wagging that war again any time soon.
976	Bass isn't even going to be there.
977	Hey, Just remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and Owen Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.
977	If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.
977	Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.
977	I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.
977	Either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you.
977	Susan
978	Sorry I didn't return your call last week.
978	I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.
978	Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.
978	I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.
978	I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.
978	Susan
979	Okay, you asked for it....
979	The mind I love must have wild places, a tangled orchard where dark damsons drop in the heavy grass, an overgrown little wood, the chance of a snake or two, a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of, and paths threaded with flowers planted by the mind.
979	I absolutely love this quote.
979	It manages to state, significantly more eloquently than myself, my own personal mantra of the last few years...I want to be pleasantly surprised.
979	Which is ultimately why I don't see it within my power in the near future to settle.
979	Maybe years down the road when desperation has set in I'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual, but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that I'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better.
979	Anyway, I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at Deborah's wedding and I love hanging out with you Mom and Becka (sp?)...they crack me up.
979	If there's anything I can do to assist you with this wedding, let me know...even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas.
979	I'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink, coffee, dinner, or whatever if you have any free time.
979	Maybe Lisa would be available as well?
979	Talk to you soon, Sue
980	Em, Glad you had such a good time...sounds like Norm may have even had a little bit of fun?
980	Anyway, must agree on the ex-fianc?
980	front ( I am understandably nervous about said individual's return to Houston ).
980	Have to agree on the German beer/food front as well.
980	I loved everything about that country while I was there, especially the people.
980	They were all so jolly and round.
980	Talk to you soon, Sue Had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend, Deborah Vest, and it was beautiful of course.
980	Happened to run into Doug George, a.k.a Big Ken, and he said to say, "hello".
980	He's living in Austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so (though hasn't applied yet).
980	He said he saw T.L.
980	recently in Dallas and Taylor has gained about 40 lbs, gone off his rocker, and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair...all sufficiently disturbing news.
980	Anyway, maybe we'll be able to get in touch with Doug if we end up going to Austin while you're in town.
981	airfareplanet.com supposedly has flights around $545 at the end of the month...may be worth checking out.
981	I keep trying to msngr you at lisaenron and it say you're not available.
981	Are you not signed in or do I have the wrong address?
982	are you using AOL or MSN msngr?
983	Don't know what you think, but Duncan Sheik is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night...Thurs could work for me too, we'll see.
984	What do I need to do to get the VCR fixed....I NEED to rent movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!
985	No problem...I'll give you a buzz if they show up at my desk.
986	please call...will be leaving in about 15-20 mins.
986	so disregard phone message and call around 11:40 your time.
987	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas trading.
987	Thanks
988	I think it's supposed to start around 8:30 and the tickets are either $10 or $15...any interest?
989	I don't know about the seating.
989	Do you have NCL tonight?
989	I can't remember if it's Monday or Tuesday.
989	Anyway, if we got there early enough, say 7:30 or 8:00, I bet we could find somewhere to sit.
989	Is that something you'd be able to do?
990	Duncan comes on at 8:30 and the tickets are $15.
991	Not for me....
992	I'm probably heading out of here in a few minutes, so call me on my cell phone.
992	Katy said she was up for going tonight too!!!
992	I think she's going to come over to my apartment around 7 or so.
992	Talk to you soon, Sue
993	I just checked some of the air fare sights and there are flights available for around what I paid for mine....not sure what i'm going to do regarding the roomie...really will have to tell her soon.
993	I'll be thinking.
993	Let me know if you come up with anything.
994	Drop me a line and let me know when you think you'll be getting in on Friday.
994	Also, did you have any interest in doing something Friday or Saturday night?
995	Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.
995	Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.
995	I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.
995	My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.
995	I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.
995	Let me know what you think.
995	Sue
996	see
997	eventually...may go to the museum after work, but it closes at 7:00 so won't be back any later than 7:30 or so.
998	nothing...just want to reflect
999	British Airways...IAH to London Gatwick...coucil travel youth fare
1000	As usual Alan, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way, do you ever return phone calls?
1000	As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously await our impending reunion in Cap City.
1000	Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of Emily who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever.
1000	Jon Jon, went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.
1000	The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.
1000	Congrats.
1000	Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).
1000	I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.
1000	Don't want to get to heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for Austin.
1000	Ciao, Sue
1001	Still working on it...have to talk about the apartment and leases tonight.
1001	Talk about bad news bears!
1002	I may cruise over to this place later with my work friend Monique...would you have any interest in going?
1002	Regardless, I'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work.
1002	Drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something.
1002	Sue Dan Electro's Guitar Bar The bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years.
1002	Bar/Club Profile The Scene The bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on Houston's sultry summer nights.
1002	The Sound Patrons ("real nice folks") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk.
1002	Electro-fying Blues Thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of Greg Allman and Richard Gere.
1002	If you're really lucky, you might even catch Jim, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars.
1002	Melanie Haupt
1003	looks like the festivities start around 9:30 or so...which is probably when I'll get there.
1003	I will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner.
1003	maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix.
1004	Well, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.
1004	Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.
1004	When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.
1004	My immediate response, "Actually, I needed some solo time."
1004	Subject closed.
1004	As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.
1004	Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.
1004	I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.
1004	Who knows?
1004	I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.
1004	And ditto on the witty repartee.
1005	Going to hear some live music tonight at Dan Electro's Blues Jam in the Heights...excited to try something different.
1005	However, I am ditching Kates, Lis, and Laura J. so mums the word.
1005	Just don't feel like having a dinner filled with cotton candy chat.
1006	I think this was intended for the other Susan Scott.
1006	Thanks
1007	Yes...except I'm sure it will take six more months before they have all of the information changed in the system.
1008	Hey there, Just wanted to check and see what your plan is for this weekend.
1008	Shoot me an email if you get the chance and let me know when you're going to be driving into Houston.
1008	Talk to you soon, Sue
1009	that sounds good...don't push yourself to do too much, you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring.
1009	plus, you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with...talk about exhausting!
1009	i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what, if anything, we want to do.
1009	personally, just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me - nothing big.
1010	Perfect....Katy also just called to let me know that John Conalee is playing at the Tin Hall tomorrow night, so that of course is another option.
1011	There's a song both you and Mary are currently playing with the following lyrics..."and now I know for the first time too, all of the ways I've been lying to you. It's not that I don't think we can't open up in time, it's just that I'm afraid of what we'll find."
1011	Could you enlighten me as to the artist's name?
1011	I keep forgetting to write it down.
1011	Thanks, Susan Scott
1012	I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with Sam - How is Sam by the way?) Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.
1012	However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting.
1012	The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.
1012	I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.
1012	If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here.
1012	There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now: Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.
1012	The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does Eleanor of Aquitaine.
1012	If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history.
1012	I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable.
1012	Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book.
1012	Hope this helps you out a bit.
1012	As for the "Peacers" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance.
1012	Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life.
1012	It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?
1012	But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).
1012	Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church.
1012	Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in Austin over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.
1012	And, I'll keep looking for you name on the Enron Field scoreboard.
1012	Later, Susan
1013	was just about to write the check...i'll save it for you!
1014	trying to call right now...are you surfing?
1015	Well...I would certainly be up for a little travel.
1015	The following locations looked interesting to me.
1015	Biarritz, Dinard, Carcassone, Perpignan, St. Etienne or Nimes in France.
1015	Cork, Kerry, Shannon, or Knock in Ireland.
1015	Brussels in Belgium.
1015	Turin, Pisa, Trieste, Venice, Pescara in Italy.
1015	And....Alghero.
1015	However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.
1015	Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.
1015	Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.
1015	Sue
1016	Hey Paul, I'm so glad you emailed.
1016	My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.
1016	It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).
1016	We will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.
1016	I may be going to Austin for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.
1016	Happy to hear about your brother and Josh's impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of Paul Thomas.
1016	Talk to you soon, Susan PS- Alan, you'll have to come out with us now....no more hiding.
1017	Hey, Good to hear from you.
1017	Can't say I have too much scoop on Reliant.
1017	Although, I do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and I'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like.
1017	I'd love to get together while you're in town.
1017	Tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance.
1017	Ciao, Sue
1018	I've got an opinion now...I think we should fly into Brescia (Italy).
1018	We could fly in and cab it to Brenzone.
1018	It's on one of those amazing lakes in northern Italy (Lago di Garda).
1018	You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.
1018	It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.
1018	Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.
1019	I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone.
1019	The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continental is evil).
1019	Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other!
1019	Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people.
1019	She does want to visit with some of the Enron people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.
1019	I figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade).
1019	Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's going to be a good trip.
1019	Let me know what you think about the Italy trip after you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I don't think either of are opposed to going back.
1019	The town is adorable and there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.
1019	Ciao, Sue
1020	Didn't you know....I hold the title of Ms. Cheyenne.
1021	Paul, Got your message last night and since both nights work for Lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky Alan.
1021	So Alan, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?
1021	If you're looking for a preference from Lisa or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.
1021	So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.
1021	Can't wait to catch up with you Paul.
1021	See ya this week, Susan
1022	Paul, I got the message you left yesterday about the 5,000 of Watkins gas from Patina.
1022	I will be sure to pass that along to Jay et al.
1022	Susan
1023	Hope the presentation was a rousing success.
1023	For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.
1023	Lisa ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).
1023	We'll keep working on the "trip".
1023	I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.
1023	Sue
1024	Trading'em up old chap....Jay was out Friday, yesterday and is still out today so the eastern rockies are all under my command.
1024	It's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so I've really just been trying to maintain sanity.
1024	As always, it is a pleasure to hear from you and I would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads.
1024	Ciao, Susan
1025	Ok folks...Thursday it is.
1025	My only questions are: Do we want to do dinner?
1025	And if so, what time?
1025	If no dinner then we can just pick someplace relatively low key to hang out and chat...Sorry Paul, no downtown clubbing for you.
1025	Susan
1026	no plans...where were you last night?
1027	Haven't decided yet, although I'd like to do dinner...any suggestions?
1028	thanks...if you don't mind creating the NC deal that would be great....either that or fax the details over and we'll do it here.
1029	thanks...do you remember what the deal is with WR Gathering?
1029	Are the deals with England and EJW over at the end of May?
1030	that could work...they do have food and it's not horribly crowded on Thursdays.
1031	Ok kids...Lisa has made the excellent suggestion of Black Lab for food and drinks tomorrow.
1031	So how does 6:00-6:30 sound to everyone?
1031	I think this link will take you to the appropriate map...if it doesn't work just go to Houstoncitysearch.com and look up Black Lab...it will take you to a map.
1031	See you then, Susan

1033	She always seemed nice to me and normal, but I'll ask around and see what I turn up.
1033	Yes, I am still coming over there.
1033	I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.
1033	Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.
1033	I really want to try and get together while I'm there.
1033	I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, Emily, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.
1033	I was very excited to hear about Caycie too.
1033	Susan
1034	So are you in ?
1035	Hey Corey, I'm thinking about driving to Austin this weekend to see Kathy & Travis's new house as well as the two of them and the kids.
1035	Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.
1035	I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs.
1035	a day...course I could be wrong.
1035	Talk to you soon, Sue
1036	Think I may head up to Austin Sat-Sun but I'll be probably be here Sunday night and will definitely be here Monday....Did you know Luke Olsen is playing at Blanco's tonight?
1036	What are you doing this weekend?
1036	Sue
1037	My bad...it's not Luke.
1037	I just called and I think they said the Hollisters.
1037	Anyway, the Radney Foster gig is extremely tempting but I really need to see my sister and the kids...depending on what Corey has to say though, I may just go to Austin Sunday and Monday.
1037	We'll see.
1037	Give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together.
1037	Sue
1038	Matty already left work, but I'll be sure to pass the message along.
1039	I'll work on the jaunt and will do on the limeade's....talk to you tomorrow.
1040	Wow...I must say this was the last thing I expected you to be emailing me about.
1040	I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.
1040	I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.
1040	Sorry to hear about Jay...that is horrible.
1040	What brings on shingles anyway?
1040	I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.
1040	Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.
1040	I'm totally empowered after "I'm Alright" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with "Wildest Dreams".
1040	Get on the Kim Richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.
1040	By the way, she's playing at Stubb's on June 14th and in Houston at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.
1040	As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.
1040	I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.
1040	That of course is the problem I'm having.
1040	Talk to you soon, Sue
1041	The price should be Inside Ferc Monthly Index....the deal has been changed in the system.
1042	Hi George You will want to liquidate the June Exotic Options today (using the valuation spreadsheet- Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls) as well as update the Option P&L file to account for the June Exotic option's value you calculate.
1042	You will actually roll-over the Options P&L tomorrow, after you finalize the 31st's P&L (the final P&L file will include any Prior Month Adjustments as well as broker fees).
1042	You will update the Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls when the actual published indexes come out...so that will most likely be Monday.
1042	At that point you can send the file to Beatrice Reyna in it's final version.
1042	If you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them.
1042	Susan
1043	Hi Ivonne, I opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports.
1043	Could you let me know what all I need to do to have this set up?
1043	I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.
1043	If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext.
1043	31455 I would appreciate it.
1043	Thanks, Susan
1044	Thanks
1045	what is it exactly you need help with...maybe i can answer your questions via email.
1046	I've never run that file since it was split out, but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file.
1046	Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Errol should be able to help you with that.
1046	Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily post-id's...you can find them on that color coded sheet George has.
1046	Swing by if you need anything else.
1046	Susan
1047	Just called...they're going to put it on our door tonight.
1047	We just have to sign it and stick it in the night drop.
1048	You guys have fun...sadly i'll be out due to a broker dinner.
1048	I'll be sure to catch the next one.
1049	Way to go...very excited for you.
1049	You will HAVE to let me Monday know how things went.
1050	Yes....but we're going to have to pay a late fee.
1051	haven't tried...will do so now...i am on msngr as well (AOL, MSN, Yahoo!...take your pick)
1052	sscott5_2000...i think
1053	"....also, some annoying requests- katy forgot all the minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party, and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic (carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!) doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send along...."
1053	Fear not, I have the turkey jerky.
1053	Address...118 Portland Road (the postcode is W11 and the tube stop is Holland Park) Phone #...011 44 2072 43 1926 (this is with the country code so I'm not sure exactly what you dial in London, I know you have to knock off the 011 and possibly the 44) If you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left.
1053	Walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto Portland Road.
1053	There will be a pizza place right on the corner.
1053	You'll walk all the way down Portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac.
1053	The roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches (a place called Janie's Wine Bar will be on your immediate left).
1053	Emily's flat is in the row of flats to your right and the number is on the door (which if I remember correctly is blue).
1053	See you there, Sue
1054	My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.
1054	I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.
1054	Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.
1054	Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.
1054	Sue
1055	Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!
1055	Yet again, I fail.
1055	However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.
1055	That way, I could see you and Jessica and Clay.
1055	I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.
1055	Sorry again for the oversight.
1055	Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.
1055	Talk to you soon, Susan Any luck on the roommate front?
1055	Do you still want me to talk to Millie?
1056	Cindy, Sorry no response from me, I've been out of the country.
1056	Being a novice, I forgot to look at the clock exactly when I crossed.
1056	I know it was 30 mins and some odd seconds, so my best guess is 30.10 minutes Hope this helps.
1056	Susan Scott
1057	See...I told you you were invited.
1057	I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.
1057	Let me know what you think.
1057	I'd been planning on going to the Kim Richey concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with Corey, Doug, and yourself if you were interested).
1057	Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.
1057	What are your thoughts?
1058	So did you make it in today?
1058	Hope you're feeling better.
1058	Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat.
1058	night.
1058	Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.
1058	Also, Boone called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.
1058	The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).
1058	Sue
1059	Hey Corey, Was wondering if you and Doug still had any interest in the Concert Sat.
1059	night.
1059	Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).
1059	The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.
1059	Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...
1059	Sue
1060	None as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.
1060	As for myself, I'm still waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.
1060	I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.
1060	Anything in the hopper for this evening?
1061	Lisa....FYI: you already sent this email to everyone (at 10:48).
1062	I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.
1062	If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.
1062	Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out.
1062	Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.
1063	back to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.
1063	I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!) .
1063	no contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.
1063	on a another "playing with fire" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.
1063	he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).
1063	we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.
1063	i'll see you when you get home.
1064	Hi Mrs. Barker, Sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday (Lisa and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting Emily in London).
1064	I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.
1064	If I am successful in pawning these things off I will be present and accounted for to help Kelly and the gang celebrate.
1064	I will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way.
1064	Thanks again for everything, Susan
1065	Hey Sarah, Nice to hear from you.
1065	I know you just talked to Lisa the other day so I got a little more detailed update from her.
1065	I'm sure she told you about our trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune.
1065	Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?
1065	Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year.
1065	Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Mike are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.
1065	I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now.
1065	As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before?
1065	I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.
1065	Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit.
1065	Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to Texas...
1065	Sue
1066	Hey gang, I think I'm in for tomorrow...so barring a snafu, I'll see y'all at the hotel.
1066	Sue
1067	Look'n sharp Mr. Scott....G.I.
1067	Joe eat your heart out!!!!
1068	I'm assuming this was meant for you...
1069	Okay...so here's the link.
1069	Once you get to the sight, click on About APB and then Just for Fun.
1069	Once you're on the Just for Fun page click on Derby 2001 and go to the last picture on the first row.
1069	You can read the names from there.
1069	Hope the first day at the new office is going well.
1069	Give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding Wednesday and the baseball game.
1069	I'm anxious to hear if you talked to Leslie again after the cryptic phone call on Saturday.
1069	Sue btw....not only no contact, but not said individual's not even logging into messenger...I think this where people tend to say "stick a fork in it."
1070	Hey friend, I just got your card yesterday in the mail and am so thrilled that you've asked me to be a part of your wedding.
1070	I will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person, but I wanted to let you know ASAP that I will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities.
1070	This really is such an exciting time in your life and I look forward to all of the festivities.
1070	Love, Sue PS - Trish Murphy is playing tomorrow night at the Mucky Duck if you have any interest.
1071	Just got your email...I'll take a look at it after morning trading.
1071	It does sound like it would be fun.
1071	What happened to you last night?
1071	I was starting to get worried about you.
1071	Also, we have one of our Taster's dinners Thursday night and both Katy and I are planning on going.
1071	Any interest?
1072	So if I can get tickets (actual seats...not standing room only) are you game for tonight?
1072	The concert starts about 8:30 so I figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat.
1072	Let me know.
1072	Sue Sorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.
1072	Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha Brooks concert.
1072	I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.
1072	I was really wanting to see Kim Richey...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.
1073	so you can only buy tickets at the Mucky Duck...I may go by right after work to try and get them...Do you want me to just call you on your cell phone and let you know if we've got actual seats?
1074	me too!
1075	Diane, I am no longer the book admin handling the trader referenced by the deal below.
1075	I have taken the liberty of forwarding this email to the individual now running the book in question.
1075	Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
1075	Thanks, Susan Scott Sean, The deal which needs to be changed is highlighted and bolded in red below.
1075	Susan
1076	Have you dropped off the face of the earth?
1076	Give me a call or email.
1077	Oh boo-hoo...cry me a river.
1077	Sorry I missed Tuesday, but I went to listen to live music with a friend from UT.
1077	How are things going with you?
1077	I had a great time in London and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.
1077	Give me a call sometime, would like to hear what's new in your life.
1077	Susan
1078	What's up with tonight?
1078	The Tasters dinner is at 7:00 at some restaurant called Fire and Ice.
1078	Shot me an email or call when you get a chance and let me know the plan.
1078	Sue
1079	Tell me more about Cara!!!!!
1080	yes...but i haven't heard the updates post date.
1081	Hey, I may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the Forest Club.
1081	What do you think of that?
1081	Also, Katy and I may go to Blanco's later if you and Leslie have any interest.
1081	So I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.
1081	I'm sick of these crappy ones.
1081	Sue
1082	Hey Matt, Just thought I'd let you know that I'm thinking about heading to New Braunfels tonight to see Emily.
1082	We were wondering if you might want to get together tonight...we've missed you terribly.
1082	You can shoot me and email back or just call Emily at the river house (830 -964-2494) or me on my cell phone after 4:00 (713-775-6472).
1082	Sue
1083	i'm taking off right now.
1083	just talked to em and her parents are coming up tonight to stay for the weekend and work on the house.
1083	call me on my cell phone, i'll have it turned on at 3:30.
1084	yes...but i've decided my hormones are about the equivalent of a 16 yr.
1084	old boy's.
1084	we left about 20 mins after you guys and i drove him to his car.
1084	he asked if i minded him calling to ask me out wednesday or thursday of this week as he is going out of town this weekend (he said he'd tried earlier this year...to which i responded "yes, and failed miserably") ...we'll see.
1084	he is a cutie though.
1084	i don't know if you'll ever have a chance to look at the picture of you know who, but physically bryan puts him to shame.
1084	Sue
1085	Thanks Theresa.
1085	Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?
1085	Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?
1085	I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.
1085	Susan
1086	Couple other things Theresa...Do we have Sinclair numbers for July?
1086	And, are the Thermo numbers in Sitara good?
1086	Thanks
1087	you are the greatest...thanks
1088	Ours is: My parents is: Glad I got to see you this weekend!
1088	Sue
1089	Theresa, You're gonna kill me, but I left all my T-account notes at home this morning.
1089	Can you shoot me the FUGG breakdown again?
1089	Thanks, Susan
1090	i'll give you a call in a few
1091	done
1092	Date: 6/20/01 7:41 AM RE: Fwd: Fw: Warning - alcohol
1093	if you get this give me a call on my cell phone....it's 5:15 right now
1094	I'm so sorry I've hurt you Boone...never my intention.
1094	I had no idea you were so fragile, you hide it well.
1094	Life at Enron is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks.
1094	I went to New Braunfels last Friday to visit one of Lisa and my friends (actually it's the girl we visited in London) and then had a wedding to go to Saturday night.
1094	No big plans for the 4th as of yet.
1094	I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to be...could be Houston, Austin or Georgetown.
1094	I know, I know...I'm such a jet-setter.
1094	How about yourself?
1094	Planning another famous Boone BBQ.
1094	Cooking commences at 3:00 am, right?
1094	Hope you're having a nice day.
1095	still the wrong one...try sscott3@enron.com, that usually works for me.
1096	Please don't send me any more compression services emails.
1096	I have nothing to do with any of the information below and should probably not even have access to it...the Susan Scott you're looking for does not have the middle initial M. There is no middle initial shown for her in the system.
1096	Thank you
1097	You still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?
1097	I just checked my messages at home and Bryan called last night...at 9:45!
1097	I was already passed out.
1097	I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.
1097	Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.
1097	I talked to Katy last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.
1097	Let me know what you think.
1097	Sue
1098	Thanks for all the info.
1098	Susan
1099	he's going to Vegas I think...And I have no idea when we'd go over there.
1099	I'll talk to Katy and see what she thinks.
1100	so i talked to bryan last night...after a few ritas and beers.
1100	supposedly we're going to do something tonight.
1100	very curious how this will all pan out.
1100	i do kind of feel "old" around him.
1100	not because he's immature or anything of that nature, but because i've been out and working for 2 yrs now and he's living at home with his parents and planning on going back to school...just feel like i'm in a very different place.
1100	of course, as usual, i'm giving this way too much thought.
1100	Susan really wanted to go to the firehouse...maybe i can tell him i have to be home early and i could meet you (and Katy) there later?
1100	i'm so bad.
1101	This was intended for the other Susan Scott.
1101	Thanks
1102	I think this was intended for the other Susan Scott.
1102	Thanks
1103	Well...when i was there you liquated the P&L post-id everyday, so unless that's changed you will continue to do that everyday.
1103	For the last day of the month you will also want to liquidate the Official post-id as well.
1103	Look at the file I've attached and it will explain how to handle the Gas Daily book this month since the last day of the month is not a week day.
1103	The notes are in blue.
1103	Let me know if you have any other questions.
1103	Susan
1104	just tried to call you at the river house....if you're online, shoot me an email when you're about to get off
1105	jeez.....i don't care how good things are between them right now, you have to respect a just the girls dinner!
1106	call me on my cell phone if you get a chance...i'm leaving the office right now.
1107	Just wanted to make sure you're okay...woke up this morning and you hadn't come home.
1107	I may be heading out after morning trading to go home b/c I feel like dirt.
1107	Sue
1108	Ina, Is there something I need to do in regards to this email.
1108	I appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone.
1108	Thanks, Susan
1109	Actually, I think this may be for you...I see Christi Nicolay's name on the distribution as well and I usually assume emails with her name attached are intended for you.
1109	Let me know if this isn't the case.
1109	Thanks, Susan
1110	Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.
1110	She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.
1110	Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.
1110	Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.
1110	As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.
1110	Sue
1111	Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Austin this weekend.
1111	Emily, Katy, myself and possibly Lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.
1111	We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Doug wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.
1111	Also, one of Katy's friends manages Pat Green and he's playing at Gruene Hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.
1111	Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.
1111	Sue
1112	I forgot Leigh Ann was going to be in town this weekend.
1112	As for this evening, I think we're still on.
1112	The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.
1112	What are your thoughts?
1112	We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.
1112	My guess is Emily would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.
1113	I'm intrigued...what prompted the cooking class?
1113	If you do end up in Austin tomorrow night, we'll have to try to get together.
1113	Sue
1114	It's been quite a while since we caught up on things.
1114	How are you doing these days?
1114	Things here are pretty good.
1114	I went about a month ago and visited Emily in London and have been busy with work, etc. Hope you had a good Fourth of July!!!
1114	Susan
1115	It happens to me pretty regularly.
1115	Time: Yesterday around 4:30 pm Conversation: Him: yo Me: hey Him: guess what Me: what Him: i'm an engaged man Him: that kind of came out of nowhere huh There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.
1115	So are you heading up to Austin today?
1115	Sue
1116	sorry didn't check email till today.
1116	things have just been really busy the last month and i've been doing quite a bit of traveling.
1116	i'm out of town this weekend, but maybe next week.
1117	No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.
1117	As for gas trading land, things are good.
1117	Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.
1117	Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).
1117	What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?
1117	Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.
1117	Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?
1117	I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.
1117	Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.
1117	Shorty
1118	thought you'd get a kick out of reading this...start from the bottom up.
1118	(you'll have to click on the web link to see the e-card i sent ted for his b-day) as monique comically pointed out this morning, "bet you never thought somebody would make ted look good?"
1118	in the land of disappointing men, it's all a matter of degrees.
1118	Sue
1119	She lives!!!!
1119	I know it's been ages since we've caught up on each other's lives.
1119	I'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming months.
1119	I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.
1119	As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.
1119	I'm actually heading to Seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then August is going to be filled with a trip to Denver (work related...I know tough) and a visit to S. Korea to see Chris and Chuck for a week and a half or so.
1119	I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and take a weekend jaunt somewhere like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing while I'm there.
1119	So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?
1119	It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and leave Monday afternoon.
1119	Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's some other weekend you had in mind.
1119	You'll have to tell both of the Eric's and Clint I said, "Hello."
1119	I had such a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.
1119	You attract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent company.
1119	By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still just good hang-out buddies?
1119	I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email that things with Brendan are still good and if so, I'm glad for you.
1119	I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute things, I absolutely love that store.
1119	And, I'm honored to be your shopping museLove, Susan PS - The job's still good and I miss you too.
1120	I know...I'm a peach.
1120	Ha.
1120	Anyway, dinner was really good.
1120	We had spaghetti (which John cooked), garlic bread and some of the red wine I'd brought over.
1120	And, we watched Crouching Tiger which I loved.
1120	You were right, it is a very woman take charge film.
1121	Em got the grandparent dinner changed to Wednesday night, so we'll be able to get together tonight.
1121	She's supposed to give me a buzz later and let me know what she would like to do.
1121	Odds are we're looking at a happy hour, followed by a nice dinner and then who knows what.
1121	Talk to you later, Sue
1122	FYI: Bryan called last night to see if I wanted to go out again.
1122	I think we'll probably end up going out on Thursday...I don't know.
1122	We'll see how it goes, but I don't feel as excited or enthusiastic as I probably should.
1122	Sue
1123	thought you might be interested in this...
1124	Last night was good...a nice, relaxed dinner suited me just right.
1124	As for a rematch, we'll see...I've got dinner with Monique and Jennifer (you met her downtown once I think) tonight.
1124	So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something.
1124	I'll give you a call later.
1124	Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com Sue
1125	I know, it's been ages since we've chatted.
1125	I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.
1125	I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.
1125	I'm actually going out of town next weekend.
1125	Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.
1125	Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.
1125	I talk to you soon, Sue Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.
1126	Did you get that Katy?
1126	Just kidding....I'll see you guys at the apartment.
1127	Hey Lis, How's married life treating you these days?
1127	I hope things are good with your job, home, etc. I was actually writing you to try and get Bonnie's email address.
1127	My friend Monique and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.
1127	Hope to see you soon and please say, "Hi!"
1127	to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.
1127	I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time Clay sent the email.
1127	Love, Sue
1128	Hi Bonnie, How are you doing?
1128	Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.
1128	Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
1128	One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.
1128	I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.
1128	It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.
1128	I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).
1128	If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.
1128	Thanks a bunch, Susan
1129	It's so nice to hear from you!
1129	Actually, we're coming this weekend.
1129	We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.
1129	At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).
1129	Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.
1129	To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.
1129	I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.
1129	Thanks again, Susan
1130	Hey folks, It's harassment time.
1130	I'm trying to put together the contact list to end all contact lists.
1130	I was hoping you guys could help me out by filling in any of the info you may already have.
1130	I've attached an excel file which has plants, pipelines and storage facilities.
1130	Fill in whatever you can and feel free to add anything you think should be included.
1130	Just take a look at the sheet when you get a chance and let me know if you have any questions.
1130	Thanks for all the help, Susan
1131	I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.
1131	We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.
1131	Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back Emily Party"?
1131	If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.
1131	Hope the paper(s) is/are going well.
1131	Talk to you soon, Sue PS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.
1132	I actually think we have the Monday off (Sept. 3).
1132	So, ideally I'd fly in Friday evening and fly out Monday afternoon.
1132	I'll email more later, but just thought I'd give you a heads up.
1132	Susan
1133	Thanks Bonnie...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.
1133	I'll give you a call on your cell phone when we get to town.
1133	It may not be until Friday though since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.
1133	Susan
1134	You added sscott5, not sscott3, to the list...I'm with natural gas trading.
1134	Thanks, Susan M. Scott
1135	Hey...if you'd like to try and get together Thursday or Friday let me know.
1135	I think a group is actually getting together Friday night for Ashlea Stuart's birthday, but I'd be willing to skip it (or go if you'd like to see some people).
1135	Anyway, just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session.
1135	Sue
1136	Hey Theresa....are you going to be putting in the Thermo volumes or would you like me too?
1137	I've decided the articles on MSN are crap and you shouldn't read them anymore....but this one made me laugh.
1138	I heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....
1138	As for me, the trip was fantastic.
1138	Mucho shopping and even more eating.
1138	Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.
1138	The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.
1138	It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.
1138	I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.
1138	It has a definite Austin vibe.
1138	The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.
1138	Oh well, I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.
1138	Sue
1139	I know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary.
1139	I can honestly say, I think this is the first time I've been invited to an Aggie happy hour....and to that end, kudos to all those who opted out of Sam's Boat...you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper.
1140	Before you know it, we're gonna start outnumbering you guys.
1141	Western Civilization was getting old anyway....we'll create a new and improved civilization.
1142	I won't give you Charlton Heston, but maybe Marky Mark.
1143	Anne, Didn't know if having this would be of any help, but here it is none the less.
1143	Susan
1144	Ina, I keep receiving this message and am uncertain of exactly what it is they need me to do.
1144	Could you take a look at it and fill me in on what action I need to take?
1144	Thanks, Susan
1145	Good luck with the paper...I know how inspired you get when deadlines start approaching, so I'm sure it'll be fabulous.
1145	Sorry about the pulled muscle.
1145	What exactly does that do to the marathon plans?
1145	Will you be able to compete still, or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now?
1145	I think you're right about Katy's move to Dallas.
1145	I have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working.
1145	I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses, etc. so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat.
1145	As for me, Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change.
1145	Enron doesn't have any offices up there.
1145	The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I don't see a move there any time soon.
1145	You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing Austin-like qualities...they are highly desirable.
1145	I will most certainly try to keep the September date open...it would be great to see Britney and Arden.
1145	We had Susan E.'s bachelorette party Saturday night (plus a bridal shower earlier that day).
1145	Lisa hosted Laura White's at the apartment the same night.
1145	I got to see and visit with Jenny Kenair (sp?), Janie Pitman, Rachel Pack among others.
1145	Very interesting.
1145	The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing.
1145	Lis was in rare form.
1145	I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me....I think she almost crushed Susan and Kelly.
1145	Anyway, it was actually pretty fun and I've decided I really like Susan's sister Betsy...good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy.
1145	I did manage to trick her into doing the V-I-C-T-O-R-Y cheer at Black Swan though.
1145	I thought it was pretty darn funny myself...she was mortified when she realized I'd got her to do a cheer.
1145	Once again...best of luck banging out your opus.
1145	Talk to you soon.
1145	Sue If you're looking to procrastinate a little this evening you can give me a buzz on my cell.
1145	I'd try calling 5 pm or after.
1146	Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.
1146	I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.
1146	Pitiful but much needed.
1146	Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
1146	Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.
1146	You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.
1146	And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.
1146	I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.
1146	Sue
1147	get online (msngr) if you get a chance...i'm still at work.
1148	It all sounds pretty good, but is there any way to get on an earlier flight Sunday?
1148	Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into Houston closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.
1148	I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.
1148	Susan
1149	sounds good....i'd rather be useless a day at work, than miss a day over there....in the grand scheme of life.
1150	Great....sounds good to me.
1150	Can't wait to see you guys.
1151	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott.
1151	I'm Susan M. Scott with Nat gas trading.
1151	Thanks
1152	I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott.
1152	I'm Susan M. Scott and work in natural gas trading.
1152	Thanks
1153	hello....long time no see.
1153	how are y'all doing these days?
1153	i'm actually writing bc i've misplaced em's phone number in london and wanted to give her a buzz.
1153	do either of you have it on hand?
1153	if so, could you please email it back to me.
1153	thanks em also mentioned something about NB in mid Sept...i'd love to see y'all if you decide to meet up with her.
1153	Susan
1154	UGH....sorry i missed your call last night.
1154	I can't find your phone number either...i'll give you a call if you email it to me.
1154	otherwise, just give me a call later today.
1155	Thanks anyway...I eventually tracked it down yesterday.
1155	And yes, the real world emphatically sucks.
1155	Emily's got the right idea, avoid it at all costs.
1155	Still, work's going all right for me.
1155	My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.
1155	I'm reserving the weekend Emily mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.
1155	Susan
1156	I'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.
1156	I would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within Enron.
1156	I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times.
1156	I'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in Denver, but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great.
1156	Susan Scott
1157	Sorry it took me so long to respond.
1157	It's been really busy here lately.
1157	You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up kayaking.
1157	Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.
1157	It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.
1157	The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.
1157	The Market was fantastic.
1157	We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.
1157	We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.
1157	Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.
1157	It be great to see you again.
1157	Thanks again for everything, Susan
1158	Paul, So nice to hear from you.
1158	I hope things are going great for you as well.
1158	I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.
1158	Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.
1158	Please tell Nathan I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.
1158	So when does school start?
1158	And, how are the small businesses going?
1158	Have a nice time at the wedding, Susan
1159	Hey Ted, Do I even know this guy, or has someone yet again confused me with the other Susan Scott?
1159	Since your one of the only names on this thing I recognize, besides Margaret's, I thought I'd ask.
1159	Susan
1160	Just wondering why my ice cream and bean burritos were in the frig instead of the freezer last night....you come up with some new storage methods?
1160	So what are you up to tonight?
1160	Sue
1161	For you....
1162	I know, I know....I dropped off the face of the earth for a while.
1162	I've actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.
1162	As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.
1162	I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.
1162	So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?
1162	The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.
1162	I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.
1162	So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different weekend.
1162	Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in September look good to you.
1162	Susan
1163	Also for you....
1164	Ditto...
1165	Another misdirected email.....
1166	I'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.
1166	However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.
1166	I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S. Korea so it should be interesting.
1166	Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.
1166	Susan M. Scott
1167	Hey...was wondering if you want to split this month's electricity bill...
1167	Last month was $175.00, this month is $183.00 and we've also started paying for water (which was only about $20 last month).
1167	Anyway, just let me know...I won't make the full check out now if you want to split.
1167	Sue
1168	Charles Bradley & Sally Scott I'll try giving you a call tonight just to catch up and see how things are going.
1168	Were you planning on going walking?
1168	Sue
1169	Becca, I am sooooo sorry I'm not going to be able to make the party.
1169	Please give everyone my best and tell Jen I would have done everything within my power to embarass her.
1169	I'm actually going to be in S. Korea visiting my brother and sister-in-law, so I do have a legitimate excuse.
1169	See you at the wedding if not before.
1169	Susan
1170	I'm flying out for Korea tomorrow morning, but give me a call when you get home from your meeting...I'm sure I'll still be packing.
1171	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!
1171	That's wonderful news....I think Laura is such a fantastic girl and I wish them both the very best.
1172	Thanks Ash...I actually don't think I'm going to go, but if I change my mind at the last minute I will definitely take you up on it.
1172	Talk to you soon.
1172	We really are going to have to get together with all of the married couples roaming about...
1173	If you email me while I'm out of town, go ahead and sent it to my hotmail account...susan_m_scott@hotmail.com I will definitely do my best to make it out there before October.
1174	Ina, I keep getting this invoicing message, could you run me through getting this resolved.
1174	Thanks, Susan
1175	You've got the wrong Susan Scott...you may want to try her married name (which I, unfortunately, don't know).
1176	did you finally talk to him today?
1176	i'm definitely interested in the movie/dinner (i have a couple things in mind) but it probably won't be till around 8 o'clock or so...if that's ok with you.
1177	unfortunate...but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for.
1177	off the soapbox....
1177	i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.
1178	sure....consider it done
1179	Ina, Could you send in a request for Unify and Dart for me?
1179	Thanks, Susan

1181	i'm here...what's your yahoo msngr name?
1182	Mine is sscott5_2000.
1182	If you go to yahoo's home page you can try to install it yourself (eek!!!) or use the search on your computer (go to Start..Search...For Files or Folders) and type in Yahoo Messenger.
1182	If you still have it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just double click on it...that should bring it up.
1182	I'm doing alright.
1182	And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment....that's exactly what I've been reminded of.
1182	That feeling of uncertainty...loss of youthful bravado, sadness, injured sense of security...all of it.
1182	Everyone in the Scott household is fine.
1182	Dad actually flew over NY yesterday morning before the first plane hit.
1182	He was coming from Manchester, NH.
1182	He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline would change.
1182	The first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in Nashville.
1182	He's still in Nashville right now obviously, but he's okay and that's what's important.
1182	I'm hoping with the limited flights they're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon, but it appears the FAA's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.
1182	Chuck and Chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been delayed - indefinitely.
1182	The Army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Korea or where exactly Chuck will be going.
1182	The stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening.
1182	A large number of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.
1182	Chuck has some pledge brother's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back home on the couch with her.
1182	I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and what was going on there, but she was fine as well.
1182	She said they'd shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of concern.
1182	We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disconcerting.
1182	I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.
1182	There were rumors flying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, our international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a logical target.
1182	Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.
1182	On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experience...including the trip there.
1182	Sounds like it was a doozey.
1182	Love ya, Sue
1183	Please tell me you're safe and well in San Diego....I just got to thinking of you and the possibility that you'd be flying between DC and LA.
1184	Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.
1185	don't know...not positive i'm going....i'll give you a call when i'm about to leave the building
1186	no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.
1186	and, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature
1187	that's exactly the sense of pride in ourselves and our country we need to be displaying right now....go for it!!!
1188	was debating sleeping but don't think i have a choice now...however, due to early morning run i will only be there briefly
1189	odds are you're on the internet right now b/c the hillegeist phone is busy....you are impossible to get a hold of, i must have called 10 times yesterday to no avail.
1189	give me a buzz at work when you get a chance 713-853-1455.
1189	lisa said she emailed you about dinner sometime before you leave, as if without her aid i wouldn't have seen you this visit...ha...anyway, talk to you soon.
1189	Sue
1190	Say they make the offer....what then?
1191	evidently only for a select few
1192	this sucks....can't nom until the internet's up how much would someone have s**t bricks if'd i'd made the same request....actually, the thought of that email response (or lack thereof) is making me laugh right now.
1193	here's the deal on the arm: just got bk from france late mon night- had lots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.
1193	triped on harry potter's cape and had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the finish line.
1193	quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a marathon.
1193	as for tomorrow...talked to Em this morning and she's on her way to NB to meet with the tile people.
1193	said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.
1193	as for tomorrow night, she's waiting to see about grandparents, etc. but may be able to meet if it's early....she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing sue
1194	i just know how big you are on feeling you owe people sometimes....i just think you have to remove that a bit here
1195	that sounds like a very good plan
1196	you look very intense....what happened to the pwr meeting?
1197	like the pendulum would be anything different after one of those...i was considering a position as fry master at Mc D's i now completely understand suzanne's comments about condescension....i feel it non-stop.
1197	the "watch out"..."maybe i should get my resume together" comments are rubbing me the WRONG way.
1197	i need to give thomas a call...i feel a boxing urge coming on
1198	you would think...the 1st time you hear the comment....but those have been made now with careless abandon..everyday...regardless of whether i'm doing good, bad or even breathing
1199	i think i'd make an excellent ski bunny...
1199	fun, likes the outdoors/being active, loves the water (i.e. hot tubs) and can top anyone in the "roaring fire/glass of merlot" department.
1200	that would look great on an application...
1200	how do you feel you've prepared for a career in foreign service?
1200	i served people from all over the world booze during their ski trips....
1201	why don't you figure out what the heck you're doing before you try to rope me into something
1202	you watch....20 yrs...i'll still be in the same desk...i'll be larry...stuck
1203	either....the man is one, giant stress ball....lost hair, overweight....just look what i have to look forward to
1204	sometimes fate plays a little bit of a hand.....but for the most part i agree
1205	I was hoping you could email me a list of eligible caterers.
1205	Thanks, Susan Scott
1206	em's with the grandparents tonight...so she's out for dinner...said maybe next week.
1206	still don't know when i'll be getting out of here.
1207	also...just b/c india may be out doesn't mean the possibility of leaving ceases to exists...remember that
1208	They don't mention India in the 5th paragraph....trying to look on the bright side...:)
1209	what's your extension...it's not in the computer
1210	if you're on the internet, call me when you are off.....
1210	Sue
1211	so...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...
1211	she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....
1211	no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....
1211	emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....
1211	as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....
1211	either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...
1211	sue
1212	are you going to the game tomorrow night?
1212	i'll be in town...wanted to see what your weekend looks like.
1212	emily may be going as well....she'd in town sue
1213	Analyst....as far as I know
1214	sorry i didn't get back to you sooner this week about dinner, but things have been crazy.
1214	my brother and wife left yesterday to drive to kentucky and their new base so most of my free time was spent with family....
1215	Lisa, This article's pretty good and it does mention India in some context, so I thought you might be interested.
1215	The India comment is several paragraphs in to the article.
1215	Sue
1216	any luck w/ my paycheck
1217	okay, i haven't made a check out yet if you still want to pay this one.
1217	i can bring it home tonight....wow on the priya thing, that really stinks....
1218	Rumor has it you went and got engaged....I'm so excited for you and Brendan....
1218	I'm going to have to give you a call sometime so I can hear all of the details.
1218	Still want to come and visit if I can....
1218	Love, Susan
1219	home number: 713-622-2788 cell number: 713-775-6472 tonight would be great...should be home no later than 7pm Houston time mailing address: 3805 W. Alabama #3308 can't wait to chat....there are some really cheap tickets to san diego right now....i'm getting the urge to jet set.
1220	know i'm extremely late on the response...but i'd be thrilled to hit the mucky duck...let me know if there's anything i can do to help out Susan
1221	i sustained injuries from friday night....two minor scratches on my index finger due to the cat, and a sore neck from head banging to limp bizkit....think mo suffered from the neck injury as well....hope your roomie wasn't irritated by the ruckus.
1222	that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ Murphy's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....
1222	btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.
1222	you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap
1223	nice....
1224	i'm so hurt...you deleted me?
1224	:( it's: sscott5_2000
1225	joefreid: There is a new MBA guy doing a rotation in Trading, his name is Edmund Gaither...have you met him?
1225	Very large, strong looking guy joefreid: infectious laugh joefreid: I went to Tuck with him TXsscott5: no....do you know what trading group?
1225	joefreid: I'll ask him when i can get him on the phone again.
1225	Monique's name was familiar...I think he just started in whatever group he is in TXsscott5: hm....but he's on the gas floor?
1225	joefreid: I think...but not sure, will find out TXsscott5: ok...i can probably track him down....
1225	TXsscott5: mo thinks i was a search dog in a former life joefreid: are you one of those people that can find anything on the internet in less than 2 minutes?
1225	TXsscott5: had a huge debate at work yesterday TXsscott5: is there such a thing as too much water....for consumption purposes TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water joefreid: personally?
1225	or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication... TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ; joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns. I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right joefreid: though TXsscott5: why not? joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right. I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc. TXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload" joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect TXsscott5: ha TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know TXsscott5: now joefreid: Cow them into submission TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere TXsscott5: ha TXsscott5: so true TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok? joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity? TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift. The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that? TXsscott5: that one still gets me TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing. But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc... TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce. Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it. joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion
1226	Hey Cindy, I went out to the web-site for the 20K to check my official time and I'm not listed anywhere.
1226	I have a feeling something could have been confused with my number switch, etc. Do you have any idea who I might contact to get that information?
1226	Thanks, Susan
1227	hey lis....
1227	i'm sorry i was late last night and not in full party mode, i too was in a bit of a mood.
1227	anyway, was going to see if you wanted anything special for dinner tonight.
1227	i thought maybe i could cook something and that we could do presents etc while watching the ever popular felicity.
1227	let me know how your day is looking and if there is anything i can prepare/pick up tonight that strikes your fancy....i'd be happy to grab berry-hill as well if that would hit the spot.
1227	sue Happy Birthday again!!!
1228	i can't the weekend of the 10th b/c of a 25K...but maybe the 3rd
1229	Just wanted to say, "thanks gals" for dinner last night.
1229	To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.
1229	Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.
1229	I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.
1229	Sue
1230	hey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.
1230	anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.
1230	.....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.
1230	talk to you later,
1231	good luck w/ the car shopping!!!
1231	i'm anxious to hear what transpires...
1231	as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.
1231	but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in. i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.
1231	talk to you soon, Sue
1232	look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway.
1232	so no harm, no foul.
1232	how are you doing?
1232	as for Enron, as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.
1232	can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the wedding and the move.
1232	btw, have you set a firm date yet?
1232	talk to you soon, Susan
1233	I got this a while ago from my dad, but i found it so moving i thought i should share it with all of you.
1234	TOBIN!!!!!......i was deceased, but i have arisen from the ashes....HOW ARE YOU?
1234	I want to hear all about the UK and how you are fairing there.
1234	If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc. Sorry you never managed to meet up with emily, but she was actually in the US when you emailed and then only back in London for about a week to pack up and head home.
1234	So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(i.e. UK vs. US for holidays and what not).
1234	If you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.
1234	Susan BTW: I'll be in Portland mid-November for work...if you happen to be home then, I'd love to see you...otherwise, any suggestions would be much welcomed.
1235	Hit really close to home for my particular tribe.....
1236	figured out what it is that grates on me w/ smith.....he is monumentally patronizing to me....and i REALLY don't like being talked down to or made to feel inferior....if i'm not on my guard, my reactions to this behavior run the risk of being swift and strong....
1237	just put it in the outgoing mail....should be good to go...
1237	hope you're feeling better today
1238	didn't want to add minutes to the cell phone bill so i'm emailing....just wanted to make sure you're feeling ok today.
1238	talk to you later.
1239	nice
1240	fill me in on your work schedule for the next 2 weeks if you please...checking some stuff out right now....contemplating a visit
1241	Hey Edith, Jennifer wanted me to let you know that she's having a little soiree Friday evening around 7 pm...Very casual, but feel free to bring others.
1241	Hopefully we'll see you there, Susan
1242	At her place....I'm not sure of the exact address, but if you need that information I can certainly get it for you.
1243	smith, pallen and others are talking about a ski-trip ASAP....as in leaving this weekend.
1243	and smith has recommended visiting you in Deer Valley.
1243	just wanted to give you some sort of fore-warning on the matter.
1243	chat w/ you later, ps - he has also said he may stay longer...eek!
1244	Hey Holly, Just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how happy I was that we were able to get together for lunch on Saturday.
1244	I really enjoyed meeting you and hearing about your experiences in Seattle thus far.
1244	Hope all is going well with you and that you continue to enjoy your new home.
1244	Susan
1245	hey bonnie!!!
1245	how are you doing?
1245	i just had dinner w/ lisa last night and some of the UT girls here in houston.
1245	she's was so excited to hear that we hung out as much as we did last weekend.
1245	I wanted to write and thank you again for being such a gracious host...i had the BEST time hanging out and fell in love with Seattle all over again.
1245	it is truly a fantastic city.
1245	hope all is well with you, and i'm continuing to explore the possibility of joining you and Holly in the Emerald City.
1245	have a wonderful holiday season,
1246	hey emily, was just wondering what you're going to be up to this weekend...found a pretty good deal to boston and was thinking about making a trip to visit....totally last minute thing obviously.
1246	if i did it, i'd get in saturday evening and leave either monday or tuesday...drop me a line when you get a chance.
1247	Hi Sarah, So nice to here from you....
1247	I'm actually still employed right now, but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here.
1247	We're all in somewhat of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc. Hope all is well with you!
1247	I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation.
1247	My roommate and I have movers coming the weekend before Christmas and as of right now I had just planned on moving back in with the folks...on a temporary basis of course!
1247	Anyway, I'm just not really sure where I'll be 2 or 3 months from now, so I'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc. If a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in I'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w/ you...but I would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent.
1247	My number at work is 713-853-1455 and home is 713-622-2788....
1247	Talk to you soon, Susan
1248	once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.
1248	i think you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fresh eyes....
1248	"the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world would first order their national life; those who desired to order their national life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who desired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of things. when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reached; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, then the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is at peace. from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the personal life is the foundation for all. it is impossible that when the foundation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly. there has never been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and strong. there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in human affairs. to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning of wisdom."
1248	right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. "exploration of knowledge of things"...and i think the "things" in this instance refer to those "things" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.
1248	i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you can't jump the sequence of things.
1248	now is the time for exploration, and i believe you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remember that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this processhope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.
1249	hey sarah, thanks for the update...i was going to let you know that i'm heading out to my parents tonight to help decorate the Christmas tree, but maybe i can come by one day this week to check out the house.
1249	just let me know what day or days would work best for you.
1249	thanks again for thinking of me, Susan
1250	I decided to go ahead and come in to the office.
1250	You can contact me via this email address or at 713-853-1455.
1250	Thank you, Susan Scott

1254	Talk to you soon, Susan
1255	Hey....my phone's not on at the apt anymore...therefore i'm only checking Hotmail at my folks.
1255	If you want to reach me quicker, i'd recommend the enron address...i should be back to daily access with hotmail shortly.
1255	Hope you had a great New Year!!!!
1256	So.....
1256	I'm doing my post New Year's check to see when and if you want another visitor.
1256	As I told you before, I am COMPLETELY flexible in regards to this weekend vs. some other time (and actually, I'm probably more flexible than just the weekend...things are still dead around here).
1256	You just have to tell me yeah or neah.
1256	I feel like you might need to share a good bottle of wine with a good friend and just release.
1256	Let me know how your schedule is looking and whether you're up to hosting one more visitor to your fair city.
1257	Ok my dear....you just tell me when a good time is for me to visit and we'll go from there.
1257	i got your x-mas present last night.
1257	thank you very much, i'm anxious to start reading it.
1257	if you do check email today, give me a shout back.
1257	we can have an old fashioned email chat.
1257	i'm worried about you mo.
1257	i've been praying for you, for all that you're struggling with...but i'm stepping it up double time.
1257	please don't completely retreat inside yourself right now...that doesn't mean you need to talk to me, but talk to someone.
1257	love,
1258	and mo....i don't need to ski, or be active, or be entertained...
1258	if you have some time off and you just want a shoulder...i can be on a plane whenever.
1259	Hi Julie, Thanks for resending the message.
1259	I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.
1259	It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.
1259	If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.
1259	Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.
1259	If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.
1259	I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.
1259	If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.
1259	Thanks again, Susan Scott
1260	Hey Bonnie, Wanted to wish you a Happy New Year, and let you know that I'm Seattle bound one more time.
1260	I have an office visit on the 11th of January so I should be getting in on the 10th and staying through the 13th.
1260	Hopefully you're going to be in town and able to do something during that time.
1260	Let me know how your schedule is looking.
1260	Can't wait to see you again.
1260	Who knows, this could be the precursor to an actual move...eek!
1260	See ya, Susan
1261	Hey old married woman....what's up!?
1261	I got your x-mas card...that was too cute.
1261	I hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic New Year.
1261	I'm also glad you and Matt liked your wedding gift...I absolutely LOVED that pitcher.
1261	I knew I wanted to get that for you the second I saw it, really too cool.
1261	(Didn't hurt that my parents wanted to pitch in on the gift.) Anyway, I really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby.
1261	I had a good Christmas w/ family and an EXTREMELY low key New Year - which was definitely ok w/ me.
1261	Hope to see you soon, Susan
1262	just an fyi...
1262	it's about 4:15 houston time and i'm planning on being at the office for a while (like maybe a couple more hours)...so, if you wanted to track me down i'd try here first.
1262	i'm studying...ha.
1263	I just realized that I hadn't emailed you yet...shame on me.
1263	Em and I (yes, it was just the two of us in NB...oh the shame) tried to call you on New Year's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room and I assume were staying with Priyah (I know I butchered that) whose last name I do not know.
1263	Anyway, I did talk to your Mom the day you arrived in Madras and knew you were there safe and sound w/ a new friend too boot!
1263	Hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings.
1263	Email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip.
1263	Good Luck and talk to you soon, Sue
1264	I'm kind of between places right now, so it's probably best to just send things to my parents house and I would suggest trying to reach me via my cell phone: 713-775-6472 i guess i'll see you at the next tasters!!!
1265	forgot to tell you....
1265	talked to Jennifer Bagwell yesterday and...she and Christian got engaged on the 28th.
1265	she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy.
1265	just thought i'd fill you in some good news.
1265	and, yes, i do think it's a good thing.
1265	also, i'm sure tori sent you an email...but, yesterday was her last day w/ ENE.
1265	i'm truly thrilled for her too.
1265	i think this is going to be a very good thing.
1266	this quote just fell out of one of my spirals....
1266	"The timid and fearful first failures dismay, but the stout heart stays trying by night and by day. He values his failures as lessons that teach the one way to get to the goal he would reach."
1266	--- Edgar A. Guest
1267	Ok...my capitalization skills in that last email were horrible...I was checking it before I realized the next click would actually send the message...my apologies.
1268	Hey Lisa...good to hear from you.
1268	Hope all is well.
1268	I assume you didn't get the other email I sent.
1268	No biggie.
1268	Just wrote to say Em and I tried to call NY's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room.
1268	I guess you were staying with Priyah (sp?) at that point.
1268	Talk to you soon!!!!
1268	Sue
1269	so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend...ha.
1269	on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt., but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect, prep, etc. anyways, just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point.
1269	got an email from Lisa...so she is at the school and sounded ok.
1269	it was a short mass email.
1269	hope to getter a longer one at a later date.
1269	talk to you soon,
1270	i'm a total dork....before my last trip to seattle i sent away for the visitor bureau's tourist packet...
1270	anyway, i was looking through it this weekend and it turns out i actually have a coupon for the symphony.
1270	nothing big, something like 10% off, but i'd just thought i'd let you know.
1270	hope you had a great weekend and i'll talk to you soon, Susan btw...i also have coupons for the IMAX and some other attractions.
1271	hey there chickie....
1271	it's about 3:00 Houston time and i'm bored out of my mind at the office...no big shock.
1271	i'll be impressed if i make it to 3:30...
1271	so, i was just going to let you know that i'm probably bolting out of here relatively soon.
1271	however, i've found a restaurant that has a little section w/ 2 computers and a couch that i make go crab a cup of coffee at later.
1271	my point being that if you email me back today i probably will have a chance to check it.
1271	if i don't chat w/ you today, i'm sure we'll touch base at some point tomorrow.
1271	and, on that note i hope things go well tomorrow morning.
1271	talk to you later,
1272	hey i'm back at the office now....and if you're going to be back at 3:00 my time i'll just stick around.
1272	glad to here things went well.
1272	i'm running to the loo, i'll be back in a few minutes if you're still there...
1273	ok....i'm back at the desk.
1273	just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight...cool.
1273	as for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.
1273	next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.
1273	i was reading a bunch of my "With God All Things are Possible" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced Jesus' reaction to a sinner who approached him.
1273	"he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself.
1273	(bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well) like i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.
1273	good luck kick'n the cold.
1273	PS - if you need a non-drinking partner at the "annual party" i'm in....
1274	doubt you're checking this before work...but if you are, i'm still at the office
1275	hey mo....how's it going?
1275	hope you had a good day at work today, mine was boring as usual.
1275	just wanted to let you know that i thought i might try to give you a call tonight and fill you in on my plans for seattle.
1275	i really feel like i have no idea how this whole thing will pan out, and i'm getting more nervous as friday approaches.
1275	oh well, c'est la vie right?
1275	i've been trying to freshen up on things and be a little more on top of my game...but it's tough.
1275	i've agreed to be out of my apt.
1275	by the end of the day Monday...saves me about $250, but then the commute starts...yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!
1275	talk to you later, Susan
1276	hey...
1276	i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.
1276	i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.
1276	i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.
1276	the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.
1276	so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.
1276	on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).
1276	i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.
1276	i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.
1276	i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.
1276	also, i'm going to see "kiss me kate" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.
1276	i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.
1276	keep us posted on all your many activities.
1276	Sue -- i knew you were going to take like a fish to water w/ this thing.....never should've worried so much.
1277	Hi Julie, I just wanted to touch base with you one last time before I arrive in Seattle and make sure that I have the correct time and location for our meeting.
1277	As we discussed, I intend to arrive at your offices at 9:00 am Friday morning.
1277	To reconfirm, you are located on the 15th floor of the One Bellevue Center Building (411 108th Avenue N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004).
1277	I will be staying in downtown Seattle Thursday night and will have my cell phone if you need to reach me for any reason - (713) 775-6472.
1277	I look forward to meeting and talking with you tomorrow.
1277	Susan
1278	Hey Holly, Just wanted to let you know that I'll be back in Seattle this weekend (tonight - Sunday morn).
1278	Not sure what you're up to, but if our schedules allow it'd be nice to see you again and hang out.
1278	I'm staying at the Claremont downtown and will have my cell phone w/ me (713) 775-6472.
1278	Talk to you soon, Susan
1279	Hey Holly, I wanted to thank you for including Bonnie and myself Saturday night...we both had a great time.
1279	It actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w/ almost total strangers, makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting.
1279	You have a nice group of friends, and I will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live, etc. should I end up moving.
1279	Hopefully I will know some more in a week or so...and when I do I will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out.
1279	Talk to you soon, Susan
1280	we need to chat....didn't know about the other cafe!!!!
1280	that's awesome.
1280	can't wait to hear more.
1281	hey mojo...
1281	sry about the missed call last night...had put my cell on silent mode for dinner and forgot to take it off.
1281	hope you had a good night.
1281	i really want to talk to you about the last week or so, sounds as if was an eventful one for both of us.
1281	i'm really curious to hear how your appointment went today so drop me a line if you get a chance today and we can set up a firm time to have a rap session.
1282	Julie, I just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the Puget trading team.
1282	It was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that I could have expressed the above in person, but email will have to suffice.
1282	I very much enjoyed meeting with John, Mark, Dana and yourself, as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff.
1282	You have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future.
1282	I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future.
1282	I went ahead and mailed all of my travel information, including receipts, to Jaquelyn Lewis as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails.
1282	If there are any other measures I need to take on that front please let me know.
1282	My previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved.
1282	Therefore, all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address.
1282	In light of this, I simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to: Once again thank you, Susan Scott
1283	"Big" performances I'd like to/be willing to see: Dixie Chicks (2/12) Lyle Lovett and Martina McBride (2/18) Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless and Nickel Creek (2/23) Willie Nelson and Lee Ann Womack (2/26) "Legends of Rodeo Houston in Concert" (3/2)....really, how can we miss this one?
1283	George Straight (3/3) Lesser knowns/has beens at other venues: Statler Brothers (1/17,1/18) - Galveston Oprea House Kenny Rogers (2/2) - Arena Theatre
1284	so i'm back at home w/ the folks...i don't see this lasting too long.
1284	mom woke me up this morning to see if i needed to get up and start getting ready...JEEZ....she said she'd heard my alarm going off.
1284	you know how big i am on the snooze button.
1284	anyway, i think we're going to have to have a chat tonight about "boundaries".
1284	Ha.
1284	in regards to enron, i still know nothing concrete.
1284	hopefully by the end of the week we should now something w/ actual facts and figures.
1284	seattle was a really good trip...hoping to know more next week on that as well.
1284	talk to you soon, Sue
1285	IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT!
1285	[IMAGE] Well, it is and that means you and me.
1285	I'm supposed to send this to [IMAGE] FIVE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, and you are one of them!!!
1285	Facts on Figures; There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels and only eight who do.
1285	Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE] If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions.
1285	The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a 12-14.
1285	One out of every four college aged women has an eating!

1285	[IMAGE] The models in the magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect!
1285	A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and shameful.
1285	Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
1285	[IMAGE] Today they weigh 23% less.
1285	[IMAGE] ~Beauty of a Woman~ The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, The figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair.
1285	The beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, Because that is the doorway to her heart, The place where love resides.
1285	The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole, But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.
1285	It is the caring that she lovingly gives, The passion that she shows.
1285	The beauty of a woman With passing years -- only grows.
1285	[IMAGE] An English professor wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.

1285	[IMAGE] ------- End of forwarded message -------
1286	don't have much to pass along....i've been looking into some places to stay if i come up.
1286	i may run a few of the names by you to see what you think or if you know anything about them.
1286	i've got to get out of my house SOON!!!
1286	mom woke me up this morning to see if i "needed to get up and start getting ready"....she'd heard my alarm go off and evidently didn't realize my extensive use of the snooze button.
1286	she then followed me out to the car to give me directions on how to drive to work (i.e. which lanes to use...ha) even though i'd made it just fine the day before.
1286	on the plus side, my meals are being made for me and there is always cheese and crackers.
1286	talk to you soon,
1287	PSWD: temple
1288	hey Ina...couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you or not.
1288	pswd: temple
1289	Do you think we could me for a few minutes this morning?
1289	I've got a couple quick questions...I didn't feel like bugging you over the weekend.
1289	Sometime before 10 am would be best for me because at 10:00 I'm supposed to attend a meeting regarding the analyst/associate program as it relates to UBS.
1289	Thanks
1290	Karen, A meeting on this subject would be beneficial to many making decisions today.
1290	Please let me know when and where the meeting will be held if it is in fact organized.
1290	Thank you, Susan Scott ext.
1290	31455
1291	Hi Julie, Sorry to be a pest of late.
1291	I was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning.
1291	There are some deadlines I am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later.
1291	If you could let me know if there is a time before 10:00 PST that would be a good time to talk I would really appreciate it.
1291	Thanks, Susan Scott
1292	Julie, I've been given a bit of a reprieve on the deadline.
1292	So, if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful.
1292	Thanks, Susan
1293	Hi John, I've been trying to get a hold of Julie this morning, but am not certain if she is in the office today.
1293	My current situation has become somewhat interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk over some things with her.
1293	If Julie is in fact out of the office today would you mind if we talked at some point.
1293	I'm under some deadlines around here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things with Julie or yourself.
1293	Thank you, Susan Scott
1294	hey holly, just wanted to see what's going on with you, and to inquire how the long weekend in whistler went...i'm curious to hear how everything played out.
1294	also, bonnie wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in tacoma and went to west point.
1294	drop me a line when you get a chance.
1294	Susan
1295	Hey...
1295	so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.
1295	Frank told me this was a "good thing" for me and that he was jealous.
1295	And Steve actually said he was proud of me.
1295	anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.
1295	still don't know exactly what happens to me now.
1295	so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.
1295	i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.
1295	i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.
1295	i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).
1295	then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.
1295	drop me a line when you get a chance, SueBob....finally living up the name!
1296	well girls, i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.
1296	i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.
1296	he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.
1296	i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.
1296	unfortunately for me, his answer was, "yes".
1296	anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with UBS to join the reformed trading organization down here.
1296	on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.
1296	let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.
1296	thanks guys,
1297	hey courtney, i'm sorry i didn't reply back to you sooner, but i'm sure you'll understand when i say that things with work have been a bit on the crazy side.
1297	i'd like to attend tonight, but have a bit of a scheduling conflict.
1297	i was wondering if it would be alright if i showed up between 7:30-8:00 rather than at 7:00.
1297	also, where exactly are the festivities going to be held?
1297	thanks,
1298	so this was my quote of the day.....
1298	Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be.
1298	-Ralph Waldo Emerson, writer and philosopher (1803-1882) wow, huh?
1298	anyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them right now.
1298	looks like i may be moving tomorrow, so i'll let you know what the future holds for me when i have a better idea.
1298	more importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.
1298	not only for striking out to park city on your own, but also for making the impression you obviously have on the people with whom you work.
1298	it's often hard to see when you are the person in question, but i can tell you from my perspective that the people you work & associate with think very highly of you.
1298	and, i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and your skills...definitely something you deserved to hear.
1298	it is a great gift to be a person others have confidence in and want to be around, and those are qualities that you possess without question.
1298	driving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone, said she had a special message for me...then mack and sally got on the phone and they sang happy birthday to me...i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start tearing-up.
1298	after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.
1298	i tried to imagine my emotions had i decided to stay on w/ the group and i don't think my optimism would be nearly so great.
1298	my point is this, sometimes not knowing exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things you normally wouldn't.
1298	so to you i say, the sky is the limit....dream, imagine, explore.
1298	we are both going to do great things in and with our lives.
1298	but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be smaller (or even grander) than we'd imagined...point being, we just need to try and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that afford us those great moments be they large or small.
1298	cheers!
1299	hey lisa....
1299	what's the scoop with tasters tonight....time and location?
1299	i think i'll try to come, even if it's just for a quick drink with the gang.
1299	see you soon,
1300	This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with all these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff.
1300	The trip to Park City was fantastic.
1300	We had some really good meals and managed two solid days of skiing.
1300	It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.
1300	Tuesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.
1300	The views from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.
1300	Monique took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.
1300	This is my first day back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.
1300	It's fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who declined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I will have company.
1300	I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trader Larry told me about.
1300	I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am excited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.
1300	Even Tobin (from my first group here at Enron) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific Northwest.
1300	I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his acquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations.
1300	Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the "effort", and I'll talk to you soon.
1300	Love, Subaru
1301	Hi Patty, I apologize for not returning your call sooner, but I was actually out of town until yesterday.
1301	If you could drop me an email and let me know what would be the best time call you I would really appreciate it.
1301	Thanks, Susan Scott
1302	Pattie, I am definitely still interested in the position and will give you a call today between 11:00 and 11:30 PST.
1302	Thanks, Susan
1303	I recently had the following wine at Wahso in Park City, Utah - USA...
1303	I was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased.
1303	I currently reside in Houston, TX but will be making a trip to Seattle, WA in the next couple weeks.
1303	Thank you, Susan Scott
1304	Hey Tobin....
1304	I just wanted to make sure you got the last email I sent you....in response to your email below.
1304	If it's just taking some time to respond no worries, if you didn't receive it for some reason let me know ( I attempted to answer the various questions posed ).
1304	Cheers, Susan
1305	You are absolutely the BEST Tobin...
1305	I think I'm flying back up to Seattle next weekend to have a second-round interview with Cascade.
1305	However, I must admit I'm intrigued by you and your father's very diverse connections in that area of the country.
1305	Hope you are doing well and that Merry Old England is treating you properly.
1305	No rush on getting back to me, I just wanted to make sure you received the email and had whatever answers I had to give.
1305	BTW....I'm celebrating my first quarter century today!
1305	Quite a milestone in one's life.
1305	I have to love that I'm essentially unemployed and living with my parents.
1305	Big pat on the back for that one.
1305	Ha.
1305	Ciao, Susan Question: Do you think you will return to the PNW when you finish with school...we hadn't really talked about your future plans and my curiosity is peaked.
1306	No worries....We can chat tonight.
1306	I wanted to talk to you about President's Day weekend anyway, and I need to do some research on that front today.
1306	Thanks for thinking of me though (if it makes you feel any better, I forgot it was my birthday yesterday morning until Mom gave me my present).
1306	Susan
1307	Sorry I missed your call last night...big shock, I was in the bath-tub.
1307	Anyways, you can definitely give me a call tonight if you'd like.
1307	Talk to you soon, Susan
1308	Emily, Thanks for the birthday wish.
1308	I'm still working on a good time to visit, so I'll keep you posted.
1308	Hope all is well with you and be sure to say, "hello" to Thomas for me.
1308	I'll shoot you an longer email when I get a chance and fill you in on all the fun stuff I've been going through around here.
1308	Susan
1309	Hey Bonnie, Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.
1309	Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.
1309	I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).
1309	Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.
1309	The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.
1309	So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.
1309	I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.
1309	Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.
1309	Talk to you soon, Susan
1310	hey...
1310	thanks for the birthday wish.
1310	i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.
1310	met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.
1310	I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.
1310	went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.
1310	as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.
1310	they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.
1310	as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.
1310	i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.
1310	it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.
1310	they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.
1310	so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.
1310	if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!
1310	hope all is still going well with you.
1310	i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.
1310	talk to you soon, Sue btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.
1310	i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.
1311	Hi Suzanne, I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.
1311	They last time I came to Seattle I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.
1311	In the past, I've stayed at both the Westin and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.
1311	I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.
1311	You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.
1311	My work number is 713-853-1455.
1311	Thank you, Susan Scott
1312	Hey Chris, I was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in Thursday evening or Friday morning.
1312	Honestly, either option would work for me I just wasn't sure if Chuck would want to sleep in Friday morning since it's his day off.
1312	Let me know which one sounds better to you.
1312	Susan
1313	hey holly, just wanted to let you know that i'll be in seattle again this weekend.
1313	i'm coming up for a second interview with cascade natural gas.
1313	i fly in thursday evening and leave monday, so if you're in town we'll have to get together some night.
1313	hope all is well and i'll talk to you soon.
1314	hey lisa, i looked in my car and couldn't find your dress, so i'm pretty sure you took it inside your parent's house saturday night...where you put it once inside i have absolutely no idea.
1314	good luck tracking it down and thanks again for letting me stay at your folks, i really slept like a log on that bed.
1315	Hey Courtney, I just wanted to make sure you got my membership check last week.
1315	If you didn't, or if there's anything else I need to do, please let me know.
1315	Thanks, Susan
1316	Mom must be at it again....
1316	career meter: You find out late this week that your suspicions were right on.
1316	You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions.
1316	It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.
1316	love meter: You feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts.
1316	It's liberating knowing where you stand.
1316	weekly horoscope: For February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct.
1316	This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer.
1316	The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice.
1316	Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is.
1316	Don't be afraid.
1316	For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give.
1316	Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears.
1316	As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest.
1316	Thought you might enjoy.....
1317	sounds like loads of fun at the hillegeist household.
1317	i'll give you a buzz later.
1317	buck-up little camper...only 7ish months to go until sweet escape.
1317	sue
1318	Suzanne, The flights sound great timing-wise and I know exactly where that hotel is located...being within walking distance of Pike's Market is always a bonus.
1318	I look forward to the visit as well as the opportunity to finally meet everyone I've spoken with in person.
1318	Thanks again, Susan Scott
1319	Hey Mr. Noble, Quick question, are you in H-town this week or hanging out on the west coast?
1319	Susan
1320	Ok...The flight option I've selected on Continental arrives at 5:17 pm Thursday and departs at 12:58 on Monday.
1320	I haven't actually purchased the ticket yet, so if you want to get back to me to suggest anything else for some reason please don't hesitate.
1320	However, if I haven't heard from you in the next hour or so I'll probably assume that the times are okay and just go ahead with the purchase.
1320	Susan
1321	I may take you up on that voucher...I'll touch base with you tomorrow at some point.
1322	I don't know if this will get to you, but I'm on the fourth floor right now...I may stop by to see if you're there.
1323	Was wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening.
1323	Also, if Janie would like one she's more than welcome to join.
1324	you tell me...you're the one that is actually working these days.
1324	Would you mind mentioning it to Janie as well...I'd hate to not offer?
1325	that's fine...i can meet you by the elevators for the parking garage
1326	You'd probably better tell me what day works for you....you're the one with the family.
1326	I'll give you a call as soon as I can find a phone down here.
1327	yes...the email address is susan_m_scott@hotmail.com
1328	Larry...I don't have a phone near by, could you log on to messenger?
1329	is that your MSN Messenger contact name?
1330	try adding me to your list....
1331	Hey Chance, I'm going to be working on west curve validation...do you have any of the information.
1331	Joe Parks told me to contact you.
1331	Susan
1332	yes
1333	if you go to "Add"...then click "Search for a contact" and type in my name susan scott, search for the person at microsoft exchange instant messaging...then click next.
1333	my name should appear and you can click finish
1334	where are you these days?
1335	sure....name the spot
1336	Hello Pete, Let me know if this is the correct email address.
1336	I was hoping to pick your brain a bit.
1336	Thanks, Susan Scott
1337	Hi Pete, Would you mind shooting me back an email to let me know if I have the right address.
1337	Brad McKay had actually given me your new work number, but unfortunately you were off the desk when I tried to call a few minutes ago.
1337	Not too long after you departed, I too ultimately chose to decline joining UBS and am currently in the midst of researching new opportunities, interviewing, etc. On that front, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things.
1337	Thanks, Susan
1338	Hi Chris, I just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume.
1338	I realize I may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with Larry, but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point.
1338	As Larry can attest to, I've had responsibilities at Enron that span from back office to trading.
1338	To that extent, I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization.
1338	Thank you, Susan Scott
1339	sure....i don't have a phone, hence no message
1340	Thanks Kathy...
1340	Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.
1340	Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.
1340	Chance Rabon has said he will do some research and I've contacted some of the traders from the West Desk who were in charge of collecting that information.
1340	Susan
1341	Did you happen to save any of the written copies of the quotes?
1342	Hey Tobin, Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.
1342	I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.
1342	The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.
1342	I have a while to make the decision.
1342	They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).
1342	In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.
1342	Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.
1342	I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.
1342	Drop me a line when you get a chance.
1342	Susan
1343	Could you shoot me an email when you get a chance...I was hoping to ask you a few questions about the west curves that Keith Holst was in charge of collecting.
1343	Thanks, Susan
1344	Keith....could you make this request?
1345	Hey Bonnie, I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.
1345	I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.
1345	I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.
1345	I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.
1345	He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.
1345	He wouldn't respond yesterday.
1345	Oh well....c'est la vie.
1345	I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated, Susan Btw...that cute place on 4th Ave in Queen Anne was already rented.
1346	hey...how's it going?
1346	sorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.
1346	btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.
1346	as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.
1346	they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.
1346	meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.
1346	living at home has been interesting.
1346	mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.
1346	still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.
1346	i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.
1346	i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.
1346	also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!
1346	babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.
1346	talk to you soon, the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.
1346	take care.
1347	Marion, I apologize for not returning your call last night.
1347	I was out to dinner when you rang and by the time I returned home it seemed too late to call back.
1347	You should be able to reach me today without any problems.
1347	If you would like, you could also just shoot me an email with a time you would prefer to talk and I could phone you.
1347	Thanks, Susan
1348	Bonnie....How was the weekend??????
1348	Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.
1348	So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.
1348	I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.
1348	I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.
1348	Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.
1348	Talk to you soon, Susan Btw...messengered with Matt yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.
1349	Question for you....
1349	which section of Queen Anne did we think seemed better?
1349	Was is the North streets or the West?
1349	And which side of Queen Anne Ave would i want to be on....I can't remember any of this stuff.
1349	Thanks!
1350	Hi Pattie, I just wanted to make sure that you had a chance to speak with Justin Fernandez.
1350	I thought of him when you mentioned possible candidates for the other open position as he was with our scheduling group and is, I believe, from that area of the country.
1350	If you haven't had the opportunity to establish contact with him please let me know and I will be sure to get each of you the other's contact information.
1350	Hope all is going well with you and I'll talk to you soon.
1350	Thanks, Susan
1351	Hey, The trip to Nashville was good...Chuck and Chris actually live in Clarksville (which is about 45 mins NW of Nashville).
1351	We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.
1351	Chuck drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.
1351	We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Maxwell Coffee fortune.
1351	Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.
1351	They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.
1351	I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.
1351	In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.
1351	At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.
1351	We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).
1351	I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.
1351	Hope things are still going well there!
1351	Keep me posted, Sue
1352	Here's the new and improved updated version...
1353	Charles, I don't believe I received the form you referred to during our phone conversation.
1353	If there is something you would like me to fill out, please feel free to forward it to this address.
1353	Thanks, Susan
1354	You should check out this website if you haven't already....
1354	lots of fun.
1355	here's the web-site address for the restaurant i think the wine we had was Eberle-Syrah
1356	Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: - Energy Risk Management Analyst fundamental analysis.doc
1357	this is becoming somewhat redundant, but thank you.
1357	honestly, your endorsement of me with these people means a lot.
1358	Hello?
1359	You can try this one, but she doesn't get to check it as often....
1360	have you been getting my emails?
1360	i gave this address to moscoso and he said it didn't work.
1361	Hi Sharon, I just wanted to make sure that you had received the email regarding my availability for the week of March 4th.
1361	If you did not, please let me know and I will resend the relevant information.
1361	Thanks, Susan Scott
1362	hey julie, sorry i've been MIA of late.
1362	i want to play catch-up with you, but i'm afraid i'd wear myself out typing.
1362	i was wondering if there was a good time for me to call (either during the day or after-work).
1362	let me know.
1362	hope all is going well.
1362	btw - i was wondering if anyone is throwing you a bridesmaid's luncheon the weekend of your wedding?
1363	Hey Paul...
1363	If you're on the computer could you log into AOL.
1363	I don't have a phone near me to call you on, we need to go over these curves.
1364	Francis Lim Jeremy Wong These individuals may now be with UBS, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.
1365	It's a very mixed web of information and people...it may take a while, but someone knows where all this information lies.
1365	Ganapathy is a great information source.
1366	cell number is 713-775-6472 signal is bad in the bldg so if it doesn't come through i'll just call you back.
1367	Hey guys...wanted to see what your availability is for this afternoon.
1367	Also, would you mind emailing the two individuals Wei listed and outline for them exactly what information it is you're hoping to locate.
1367	Thanks, Susan Scott
1368	Hi Wei, The PWC guys said that 1:30 would be fine.
1368	I have also asked them to email Chris and Bjorn with their requests.
1368	If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.
1368	What is your location again?
1368	Thanks, Susan
1369	Jacquelyn....I don't think this was intended for me.
1369	Thanks, Susan
1370	Actually, I think the PWC guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate.
1370	I believe we're going to try to meet with Wei Hu this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables.
1370	Thanks, Susan
1371	What's the deal with the exclamation points Bjorn...you can't be that excited about this meeting.
1372	Looks like this visit to Seattle is going to be a quick trip this time.
1372	I fly in Sunday (yes, this Sunday) and fly back out after my interview on Monday.
1372	Maybe we could grab dinner Sunday night...that is if you're free of course.
1372	We could even see what Holly's up to.
1372	Talk to you soon, Susan
1373	Thank you Jacquelyn...I look forward to the trip.
1374	Hey Lisa....
1374	I'm probably going to have to head out this evening.
1374	I'll call you on your cell phone to let you know if I'll be able to make dinner or not.
1374	Can't wait to see you guys.
1374	Susan
1375	Hey Holly, Just wanted to let you know that I'm flying in Sunday evening for an interview on Monday.
1375	Bonnie and I are talking about going out to dinner, nothing big, and were wondering if you might have any interest.
1375	Let me know your thoughts and if I don't here back from you via email I'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend.
1375	Hope things are going well.
1375	Susan
1376	Sorry Mo....certainly didn't mean to bum you out.
1376	I'm a torrent of mixed feelings today.
1376	Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.
1376	I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too.
1376	I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available.
1376	and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten.
1376	so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever.
1376	i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity.
1376	i feel luke warm about too many things.
1376	and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far.
1376	give me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment.
1377	Craig, In an effort to make sure that I am adequately prepared for my interview, I wanted to touch base with you and confirm that I possess all the necessary information and forms.
1377	Last week I received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information.
1377	Also, I have confirmed my flights, hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with Sharon Roberts.
1377	I assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession, if you know of any additional information I may need please let me know.
1377	The last area of interest I am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule.
1377	If it is possible at this point in time, I would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom I will be meeting.
1377	If the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request.
1377	I look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow.
1377	Thank you, Susan Scott
1378	i will see you there....i'll have my cell
1379	Shelly, Thank you for taking care of all the travel arrangements and interviews.
1379	I look forward to meeting with yourself and the various other members of the Aquila team tomorrow in Kansas City.
1379	The web page links you sent were very informative and certainly gave me a better understanding of Aquila and it's company culture.
1379	I also wanted to let you know that I did complete the on-line application you referenced in your last email.
1379	If there is anything else you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask.
1379	Thanks again, Susan Scott
1380	Kevin, Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week.
1380	After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.
1380	It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.
1380	To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.
1380	As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.
1380	I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.
1380	Good luck with the many tasks ahead and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.
1380	Thank you, Susan
1381	Craig, Just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.
1381	I know your schedule has been busy of late, but I very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding Cinergy and the Cincinnati area.
1381	The types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities.
1381	Good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.
1381	Thanks, Susan
1382	Just got to work...I know, it's ridiculous.
1382	Anyway, just let me know if you can break for lunch...if so I can meet you in your building and we can hit the food court.
1382	Lunch can easily be accomplished in 30 mins if you're crunched for time.
1382	sue

1388	i'm so bored it's painful
1389	what's the deal w/ post work activities?
1390	Hi Herb, Tim Bowler had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line.
1390	I have been working with Tim for a couple weeks at Enron and, upon learning that I was in the midst of job hunting, he suggested I contact you.
1390	For the last year I served as an assistant trader on the West Natural Gas Desk (Wholesale).
1390	For various reasons I chose to decline an offer in February with the newly formed UBSW Energy and am currently still working for Enron.
1390	I'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience.
1390	If you know of any opportunities that seem like possible "good fits" I would very much appreciate hearing about them.
1390	Thank you, Susan Scott

1396	think it went well...they're starting the biz from scratch kinda so a lot is undefined at this point...could be a really good opportunity
1397	Hi Joe, Just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I received my offer information from Jeff Rogers.
1397	Since we didn't have a chance to meet and talk when I was in Kansas City last week, I was hoping at some point we might be able to discuss the responsibilities you envision for me within your group.
1397	Please let me know when would be a good time for us to speak.
1397	Thanks, Susan Scott
1398	it was good....i'm actually heading out right now.
1398	call me later.
1399	got in at 10....just read the article....i agree whole-heartedly, which is why i declined w/ Cascade up in Seattle...totally identified w/ his comment about being depressed before even start the job.
1400	hey....do you think you could escape for 30 mins...even 20...and if so, when?
1400	i thought i'd hit the cafateria in allen center for lunch
1401	hello?
1402	hey...just got back from a late lunch
1403	call me if you get a chance 713-853-1455
1404	Barnaby's: Backstreet Cafe: Mark's:
1405	Hey Lis....
1405	As always it's good to hear from you.
1405	I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).
1405	Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!"
1405	for me...that is awesome.
1405	I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc. I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).
1405	You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!
1405	And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.
1405	If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).
1405	I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.
1405	So things are definitely happening.
1405	I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).
1405	Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.
1405	Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.
1405	She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.
1405	They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go.
1405	Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott.
1405	My Mom and Chris's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.
1405	Chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.
1405	So say a little prayer for them if you can.
1405	I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.
1405	Take care and I'll talk to you soon.
1405	Sue
1406	Hi Jose, I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days, and more importantly where you are?
1406	I'm still at Enron right now working for the "estate".
1406	I've been interviewing and have a few offers, but am not completely sure what I will be doing.
1406	Hope all is well with you and I'd love to hear what is going on in your life.
1406	Susan

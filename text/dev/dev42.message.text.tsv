0	No problem.
1	Here's the current version.
1	I'm going to give it another look, then I suspect we will be ready to go.
1	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
1	Kay
2	Looks good to me.
2	Is it ready for me to print and give to Ben?
2	Kathy, how many originals do you think we should have signed?
2	4 or 5?
2	Or some other number?
2	Kay
3	Rey, This email explains why Jeff and I tried calling you this am.
3	Any comments?
3	Thanks, Kay
4	What issues were invented?
5	Some thoughts, observations, suggestions: 1.
5	Advantages to the single contract: Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
5	Better from a liability standpoint.
5	Easier to administer.
5	Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?
5	I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.
5	3.
5	Assignment to Mitsui Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested payment within 3 days of executing the contract.
5	This means that the assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE contract.
5	I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.
5	Peggy is checking on this, also.
5	4.
5	Parent guaranty.
5	GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.
5	From a quick review of the draft contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment to a certain class of assignees.
5	If I am correct, then I suggest consider inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if necessary.
5	Kay
6	fyi.
6	I faxed it to David, originals being sent to you.
7	Hi Jeff, I'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment.
7	Can you help me with the name and address to use?
7	Thanks, Kay
8	I did not authorize anyone to initial any version of the document.
9	FYI.
9	I'll send a copy of the executed original change order once I get it.
9	Kay
10	Evidently GE feels that we already have an agreement based on something Brian signed before the agreement was reviewed/approved by Tax and Legal.
10	The internal process is not working.
10	Kay
11	Hi Charlotte, We are going to the Astro's game tonight, so it would be very easy for one of us (probably Neil) to pick Michael up at your place, probably after 630.
11	Is that ok with you?
11	Thanks, Kay
12	Hi Kathy, I neglected to keep a hard copy.
12	Please send hard copies of the change order to: Brian Hulse, Carl Tricoli, and me.
12	If you prefer, you can just fax it back, and I will send it to the ENA folks.
12	Thanks, Kay
13	Hi Brian, Could you email me the MOU we are terminating?
13	Thanks, Kay
14	If someone can tell me which ENA lawyer worked on it, I'll track it down.
15	The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the assignment and assumption agreement.
15	Kay
16	They came by and gave me the data dump.
16	It filled in the picture very well.
17	Thank you.
17	That would be helpful.
17	Kay
18	Here's the latest from GE.
18	When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to review the final drafts of the GE agreements.
18	I don't know the resolution of that issue.
18	As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.
18	Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui bought in on the payment plan?
18	I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff.
18	I would also like to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior agreement with GE.
18	Kay
19	FYI.
19	Congrats on your new baby!
19	Kay
20	I hope that spelling your name correctly will help this get through to you.
20	Kay
21	Accomplishments: I haven't jumped out the window yet, or slapped/cursed anyone from any other Enron entity.
21	This is significant in a way that not all would understand.
21	Vision & Values.
21	My other significant accomplishment was the LM 6000 deal: revising the structure, figuring out how to sell the WestLB stuff to GE/S & S, and closing it in a relatively short period of time.
21	More to come!
21	As for vacation, I'll scatter some days off here and there, but I don't have any plans for consecutive days off.
21	Kay
22	FYI.
22	Talking tomorrow am is fine.
22	I have a 900 conference call on another matter; otherwise, I'm open.
23	I've made some changes, which I thought I would circulate internally for comment before sending to GE.
23	I left Jeff Smith a voice mail asking how the initial payment is supposed to be split between the on and offshore contracts since this document references payments to both.
23	Comments?
23	Kay
24	I've made a couple of changes, including changes suggested by Jeff Blumenthal.
24	Main difference is title/risk of loss language and definition of "the Agreement" since we don't have an MOU.
24	Kay
25	My only comment is that the word "lease" should be deleted from the heading in paragraph 3 of the assignment agreement.
25	Kay
26	Gracie, This is one of the ones I cancelled, since I haven't taken Wellhead to Burner Tip yet.
26	Thanks, Kay
27	Hi Bobby, Ok, here's another detail: what's your web address?
27	Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.
27	I know Michael would be delighted.
27	We could take them to the Pink House, if they preferred.
27	Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile.
27	I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.
27	If there's anything I can do, please let me know.
27	You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers.
27	I can't imagine what you, your dad and sister must be going through.
27	I can relate to Katie and Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of sadness.
27	I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with her.
27	What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they must have brought to her life.
27	Love to all, Kay
28	I'll be glad to assist.
29	My comments to the Assignment Agreement are as follows: In paragraph A, "transformors" should be "transformers".
29	Please note the following comments to 6: 6.
29	Successors and Assigns.
29	This Assignment shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and assigns.
29	This Assignment and the rights and obligations herein may not be transferred or assigned by one party without the other party's written consent, except that Assignee shall be entitled to assign this Assignments to Calumet Power, LLC or its affiliates (if permitted by the Option Agreement) and there upon be released from any and all obligations hereunder upon the giving of written notice to Enron.
29	I do not have any comments to the notice.
29	Please let me know if you have any questions.
29	Kay Mann
30	John, Here's ABB's wiring instructions: The wire transfer has to be sent to ABB Trafo, S.A. Our bank coordenates and account number are: Bank : Deutsche Bank Swift Code : DEUTESBB Notice should be sentto: Michael Sandridge Comments to the assignment will come separately.
30	Please let me know if you have any questions.
30	Kay
31	ABB is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue.
31	Their concern appears to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not have the financial ability to pay.
31	I believe they are looking for some type of security (LC, bond, guaranty).
31	I didn't sense that they have an issue with the identity of the assignee, just the ability to pay.
31	Comments?
31	Kay
32	Chris and Mike, We are trying to do some sales tax planning, and need to know when the first LM 6000's will be ready to ship (or store, as the case may be).
32	I know there are projected dates in the purchase agreement, but those were more targets than commitment on the first few units.
32	Can you give the current status?
32	Thanks, Kay
33	Here's the latest version.
33	It looks ok to me.
33	The most substantive aspect of it is that Calumet Power (or its affiliate) could end up the indemnity obligations under the agreement.
33	(in other words, an entity without a lot of money to fund indemnity obligations) In my opinion this isn't important in the context of the option.
33	Unless someone objects, I'll tell PERC that Enron is ready to go with the assignment.
33	Kay
34	Matt, Our preference is to sign this before June 19.
34	I recall that Herman is out.
34	Do you know when he will be back?
34	I will make sure that you and Herman get a copy of the next draft.
34	It won't be this week.
34	Kay
35	Just for your info.
36	The agreement and notice are fine with Enron.
36	Kay
37	For your review.
38	Stan, Could you please me send me the electronic file of the executed EPC contracts, including the consolidation agreement?
38	Thanks, Kay
39	Please email the signature version of both documents.
39	Thank you, Kay
40	Jim, Per Gregg's request, I am forwarding ABB's wiring instructions.
40	Please let me know if you need anything else.
40	Kay
41	John, The price includes shipment to the site and installation, but not connection.
41	Therefore, there is no additional freight charge.
41	Kay
42	John, The executed signature page has been faxed per your instructions.
42	Kay
43	Jeff: Here's a draft for your review: I suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the intial payment to be made within 7 business days of execution.
43	That way, we can sign this up next week.
43	Kay
44	Gentlemen: I have been advised by J. Nassos that Peoples (through WestLB) will be exercising the ABB option today.
44	I have asked that they send me a copy of the notice of exercise of option, and I left Mike Sandridge a voice mail telling him to expect it this afternoon.
44	Please let me know if you have any questions.
44	Kay
45	Jeff, I'll focus on the consolidation agreement today.
45	It seems to me that the time GE has to remit the payment to ENA should remain 3 days.
45	I don't see a reason to stretch it to 7 days, since it represents a double payment.
45	Your thoughts?
45	Looks like the tax issues are completed.
45	Kay
46	This time I'll include the attachment.
46	It must be Monday.
46	Kay Enron North America Corp.
47	Team Vitro: I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.
47	Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms, etc. as the other 2 contracts.
47	He also provide alternative language which appears to be close to what was in the previous draft.
47	Since I didn't know the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I would check with you first.
47	I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination.
48	Hello again, If these contracts are going to be assigned immediately to Mitsui, isn't the issue of a guaranty a Mitsui issue?
48	Is this addressed in the EPC contracts?
48	If an Enron entity must give a guaranty, I would think we would want ENA to give it, to be replaced by a Mitsui guaranty unless we have some safeguard against the possibility of paying Mitsui and Mitsui not paying GE, so that we would have to pay twice.
48	Kay
49	FYI.
49	Is there a conference call scheduled for today, and is Boyd available tomorrow?
49	Thanks, Kay
50	Hello again, Makes sense to me.
50	I would add "on behalf of MEH" after "Transaction" on the first line of the second paragraph of VII.
50	I don't have the MEH Operating Agreement.
50	Do you have an electronic copy of it?
50	Thanks, Kay
51	FYI.
52	Isn't it nice to know he is looking out for you?
52	You can tell how much he cares about you.
52	Thanks for sharing the stories.
52	I really enjoy each one of them.
52	Kay
53	Hi Gregg, I'm looking at it.
53	Kay
54	A little light reading.
54	Another will follow.
55	As promised...
56	Fred, My understanding (which I will verify) is that Enron would still be at risk from an environmental standpoint with a lease.
56	We could try to lessen our exposure as much as possible with the lease, and get indemnity from PGL.
56	Kay
57	Per your request.
58	Hi Richard, I'm working on a form EPC contract.
58	Do you have a favorite arbitration clause you would suggest be included?
58	Thanks, Kay
59	Who is authorized to sign on behalf of this company?
59	Thanks, Kay
60	Gentlemen, I have made changes to the consolidation agreement, which I hope all will find acceptable: (It does need a date or two.) As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest: Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?
60	I would suggest that we make the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the contracts immediately.
60	That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if necessary.
60	If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.
60	Sorry I missed your call.
60	It was a day of meetings.
60	I will be on the road tomorrow, but will check my voice mail.
60	Kay
61	Gentlemen, Here's the notice we discussed.
61	Kay
62	Did you guys work out anything on the 12th slot?
62	Thanks, Kay
63	FYI
64	I thought I recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the LM 6000 deal be incorporated into a "master".
64	Maybe I misunderstood (not the first time!!!)
65	Christi, I'm so glad you wrote, not just because the information is so important, but also because I've been meaning to return your call.
65	I look forward to working with you on this and other issues.
65	I'm sure I'll be calling with questions soon.
65	Kay
66	This is the most current information I have on specifications.
66	I sent Ben and Mike an email about the 12th slot, but haven't heard from either one of them.
66	By the way, I was asking about whether the changes I had suggested for the transformer contract had been included in the Calumet equipment purchase terms, as I was confident the changes are in this agreement.
66	Kay
67	I haven't opened the attachment yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap.
68	Here's the attachment.
69	Any time is good for me.
70	Will do.
71	Hi Sheila, I'm happy to take care of this, I just want to make sure I'm not stepping on anyone's toes.
71	Is anyone else working on this?
71	Kay
72	Hi again, I accidentally deleted the emails you sent me about Gleason.
72	Could you resend them?
72	Thanks, Kay
73	John, Probably safe to assume it is me.
73	Kay
74	An update...
75	I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about the tests, etc. Do you still have it?
75	Thanks, Kay
76	Mike, Here's a revised version of the option agreement.
76	I changed the shipping dates, quantity (10), Outside Exercise Date, and the amount of the option payment.
76	I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work.
76	Have there been some changes to the data sheets?
76	It appears to me that there might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.
76	In the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option.
76	Please call or email me if you have any questions or comments.
76	Kay
77	Hi Rusty, Just wanted to check to see if you can get me a copy.
77	Thanks, Kay
78	Brian, I'm not sure I understand their objection to the wording about the guaranty.
78	Do you think that there is going to be a problem with them accepting the Mitsui guaranty?
78	I don't know what the arrangements are with Mitsui, and perhaps there isn't a real issue due to how this is being handled in the EPC contracts.
78	My understanding is that Peggy will be giving legal sign off on these agreements for ENA.
78	Kay
79	Brian, Could you please email the electronic version of the GE contracts which are ready for execution?
79	Thanks, Kay
80	FYI.
81	Per your request.
81	Kay
82	For your information.
82	Please call me with any comments.
82	Thanks, Kay
83	FYI.
83	When do you think you'll be done?
83	Thanks, Kay
84	We seem to missing the termination agreement.
84	I'll check with Brian.
84	Kay
85	Brian, The termination agreement needs to be signed at the same time.
85	Here is what I have as the latest draft: I never received a copy of the assignment and assumption agreemen, and the legal assistants have not been able to locate it.
85	Has anyone found it?
85	If not, we need to get a copy from GE.
85	Kay
86	Peoples stuff.
87	We are very early in the process on this one, so you haven't missed out on any opportunities!
87	Kay
88	This is very helpful.
89	David, For information but no action on your part at this time.
89	Kay
90	Hi Nancy, Lisa Mellencamp's time is being consumed by a special project, so I'm working on this PPA.
90	Could you give me a call at your convenience?
90	Thanks, Kay Mann
91	How about 10:00am on Thursday to discuss GE and how to end world hunger?
91	Please let me know if this works for you, and I'll get us a conference room.
91	Nominations for other participants would be welcome.
91	Thanks, Kay
92	I expect Ben to turn up the heat today.
92	No pun intended.
93	Hi Kathy, Please let me know if you get to the point where the exhibits are all that need work.
93	If you are there now, please send me the current version electronically.
93	Thanks, Kay
94	Thanks.
94	I'll keep it to myself.
94	I think having a list is a sign of progress.
94	830 am is a bit early to work it into a happy hour.
94	However, there are lunch possibilities...
94	The other commercial issue I saw was confirming the invoicing procedures, how/who will calculate cumulative net revenue, and flow of money in general.
94	Fits in with the refund stuff.
94	Kay
95	Hi Stan, Not to rush you, but do you have an estimate of when you will have completed your review/memo?
95	Thanks, Kay
96	Stan, For some odd reason I am having difficulty forwarding this email to Peggy and Sheila.
96	Please forward it to them for me.
96	Thanks, Kay
97	I'm glad you found something interesting to do.
97	Let me know if you meet anybody famous!
97	We now have televisions in the elevators.
97	At first, CNN ran all the time.
97	This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP program.
97	It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.
97	I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.
97	I found it difficult to summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college grads.
97	Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.
97	I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.
97	His gain is our loss, but I understand completely.
97	Take care and keep in touch, Kay
98	Nancy, Here are some come comments to the draft PPA: As a general note, we would have these goals: 1.
98	Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in the interconnection agreement.
98	2.
98	Minimize ties to specific unit.
98	3.
98	Maximize optionality, especially delivery points.
98	4.
98	Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet.
98	5.
98	Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.
98	More specifically we would like to: Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement.
98	Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.
98	Bracket 192 for now.
98	The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be determined.
98	Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.
98	Comments on specific articles: Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement.
98	2.2 Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move bracketed language into interconnect.
98	2.3 We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term "breach" should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any of the agreements.
98	Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?
98	We can add change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want to broaden the definition of change of law.
98	Also, we don't have the site acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site.
98	3.4 Peak period is July and August.
98	3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.
98	Might just leave blanks as placeholders.
98	3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice.
98	3.5 (d) suggest title "Start-Up Minimum Run Time".
98	3.5 (e) add maximum of ___ per year.
98	Need a minimum shut down time between start ups.
98	4.6 Note: 3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to the wholesale market.
98	We should pick a term, define it, and use it throughout.
98	8.1 (c) replace "covenant" with "obligation", and follow with "(other than payment)".
98	Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.
98	8.1 (d) remove "shall" and conform grammar in romanettes.
98	8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass the concept.
98	A little unclear to me.
98	How is this supposed to work with 4.8?
98	Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?
98	Does the sole and exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok?
98	9.1 Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an invoice?
98	10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second "Seller" be "Buyer"?
98	15.
98	No mediation.
98	16.1 Delete oral amendment language.
98	Exhibits: A. Megawatts, heat rate to be confirmed.
98	Heat rate believed to be 10,600.
98	Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source energy.
98	Start up costs: $500.
98	Emergency start up to be addressed later.
98	Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any questions/issues.
98	Please let me know your availability.
98	Thanks, Kay
99	As requested.
99	Please call if you need anything else.
99	By the way, I have the original contracts in my office.
99	Kay
100	Nancy, Please call me about this.
100	Thank you, Kay
101	I'm available any time except 300-430 on Monday.
101	Have a good weekend.
102	Hi guys, I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.
102	Kay
103	Anybody uncomfortable yet?
104	Suzanne, please forward this to Jeff.
104	My email is acting up again.
104	Hi Jeff, I thought I would pass this email along to you since you've been working on some of the aspects of the Peoples deal.
104	I don't want to interfer with whatever you have going on, but I'm happy to assist/participate in whatever way makes sense.
104	Kay
105	Good idea.
105	I'll let him know.
106	Marty, FYI.
106	Sheila mentioned that Mitch is one of your guys.
106	Kay
107	Hi Kathy, Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6 Definitions.
107	I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and replace of business days for Business Days.
107	1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of performance test reports.
107	I think we need a definition that incorporates the tests listed on Exhibit E. The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of the installation option when I did a search.
107	3.14.2.1 Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?
107	Does it matter?
107	4.3 Delete "Each".
107	5.1 The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm interpretting it incorrectly.
107	5.3 (ii) add "as provided in Section 5.5" 6.4 I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller would be charged interest if not timely paid.
107	10.7 Are the roman numerals correct?.
107	I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back option.
107	You should have it today.
107	Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read before?
107	I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.
107	Thanks, Kay
108	Sounds good to me.
109	Stan, I have one minor question.
109	Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following y event?
109	I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".
109	I see the deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this EPC different terminology is used.
109	Kay
110	Hi Heather, Here's a form of LOI we can use.
110	Nancy W. called and is ready to discuss the PPA.
110	We can call her after our meeting, or before if you have the time.
110	Kay
111	Ok.
111	So basically all bets are off if we don't give NTP by September whatever.
111	Sounds good.
112	Hi guys, Here are some quick thoughts: 2.10 Suggest we delete "specific" from second line.
112	3.3 (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple of business days before date due.
112	6.2 We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.
112	I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.
112	Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?
112	I think we probably need to limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.
112	Maybe "reasonable efforts, short of litigation", something like that?
112	That's all for the first quick read.
112	Kay
113	Here's the new version with attachment.
114	Here's the latest version: Kay
115	I'm waiting to hear from Ben on the buy back, and I need to incorporate some changes which were given to me by others.
115	I noticed the paragraph headings duplicated themselves on this last draft.
115	Odd.
115	More to come!
115	Kay
116	Did you get this?
116	The address for you looks odd.
117	I'm not sure I understand it.
117	I wonder if they mean payment in full has been made as of the time of the assignment.
117	I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this, hopefully this afternoon.
117	Kay
118	Hi Nancy, It seems we may be scheduling a meeting with VEPCO to discuss the PPA.
118	July 20th is the current date being discussed.
118	I don't know how we want to staff the meeting yet, but I do want to check your availability.
118	How does that date look for you?
118	Thanks, Kay
119	FYI.
119	Kay
120	Sheila, I believe I can help Lisa with this information, at least confirming some of the stuff for her.
120	Kay
121	Ben, This email has the prices in Exhibit N of the current draft agreement.
121	Are these the correct numbers?
121	Kathy and I discussed your comments, and she is making changes to the contract consistent with those comments.
121	She is not available this afternoon, but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract.
121	Please let me know if tomorrow am works for you.
121	Kay
122	Gentlemen, I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract.
122	The language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the same, and in some respects better.
122	Please let me know if you have any substantive comments: I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.
122	It is being revised to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).
122	Also, in the fourth line of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the parenthetical, after "WestLB".
122	Any other changes should be very minor or technical.
122	We are trying to get this finished this week.
122	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
122	Kay
123	Hi Kathly, Note addition of word "Purchaser".
123	Guess the haul and install stuff is up in the air.
123	Kay
124	I believe I was told Richmond.
125	Here's what I can give you without talking to anyone: I am not familiar with the Goldendale turbine (#7 on ENA long list).
125	ENA's CTG group lists #7 as being an EECC turbine for Goldendale, not an ENA asset.
125	I don't know the 2 used GEC turbines (#8 on ENA long list).
125	On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew this).
125	I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal; I don't know about the Choc.
125	Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA projects.
125	Maybe these are sleepers.
125	I can chase down more info, and Sheila probably has a great deal she can tell you just from looking at the list.
125	Kay
126	I'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the VEPCO deal.
126	I've limited it to the land in Edgecombe County, changed the initial period to 90 days (with 3 x 90 day renewals).
126	The price is changed to $137,600, as have the option payments ($3500 for each 90 day period).
126	Is there anything else which needs to be changed?
126	FYI, I've left a message for Dutch Bumgarnder, VEPCO's lawyer, concerning the interconnection agreement, and who is doing what.
126	Thanks, Kay
127	Rusty, Let's meet at your convenience.
127	We need to identify some of the tripping points and critical path items, especially since our goal (I assume) will be to keep equipment, EPC contracts, land (?), etc off Enron's balance sheet while things are developing.
127	Talking through the process should help.
127	Kay
128	We can discuss this am.
129	I don't have a problem with not back dating it.
129	I'll see if there's a sesitivity to it from ABB's side.
130	Lisa, Thank you for the timely comments.
130	Credit support.
130	On the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company.
130	Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are different, with GE being more front end loaded.
130	For example, GE will have received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have received 95% of the payment.
130	In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.
130	Effective date.
130	The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.
130	In the GE contract we addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle.
130	It is fine with me to make the effective date a current one.
130	Price change.
130	I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest option agreement.
130	I suspect there were changes in the specifications since the data sheets have changed.
130	Hope this was helpful.
130	Kay Enron North America Corp.
131	No problem.
132	For your reading pleasure...
133	Hi Juan, Some strange things happened when I restarted my computer.
133	This little screen came up, saying "installation aborted".
133	I chose ok, which was my only option.
133	I'm obviously on it now, so we'll see how it goes.
133	Thanks, Kay
134	Mike, I've been trying to figure out what is meant by the last sentence.
134	Can you (or Dave) clarify what is wanted?
134	Does it mean that payments must be current for the guaranty, etc, to be acceptable?
134	Thanks, Kay
135	Here's what I have on the open issues/ to do list: Resolve shipping/delivery obligations in accordance with option agreement; conform contract Confirm pricing Add schedule of delivery dates Finalize assignment language (I sent Mike an email with a question about their request) Agree on effective date: suggest signing date be whatever it is (hope for tomorrow) with effective date being the last day of last option Need estimated price per month to store (a request from Finance for budget purposes) Verify sales tax exemption with WestLB (doesn't require ABB involvement, nor does it need to be done before contract is signed) Need assignment of option (Finance to provide - no ABB action, I'll follow up) Kathy: do you have anything to add?
135	Are there any technical details left to resolve?
135	Ben, anything to add?
135	I'll send a cleaned up version to Mike tomorrow am.
135	Thanks, Kay
136	Thought you might be interested.
137	Thanks.
137	I'll give you a call in a little while to compare notes, status, etc. Kay
138	Hi Mike, Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.
138	I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language.
138	Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.
138	What we have tried to do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.
138	This addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the "financial wherewithall" to make the payments.
138	This is a big change from where we were in the last contract.
138	I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary purposes.
138	This is in connection with the buy back arrangement.
138	Can you give me a guesstimate?
138	Thanks, Kay
139	An "April-less" version...
139	Kay
140	Here is the most recent (and dare we hope last?) draft of the ABB agreement.
140	Kathy Clark is preparing a redline for your use, and you should have it shortly.
140	ABB may be insistent upon dating this June 30, but we will try the 7th with an effective date of the 30th.
140	Ben advises that this is a very, very critical point to ABB.
140	I have not taken ABB's comment on the assignment language, but I hope they will accept what we've given them in this draft.
140	I have been advised that the price reduction is due to more definitive design criteria being provided by Enron.
140	Matt Gockerman points out that their is exposure to Missouri sales tax, so we will need WestLB's cooperation in getting the proper exemption certificate for MO.
140	Have I forgotten to address any questions or comments?
140	Thanks, Kay
141	Hi again, Could you send Rev 10 to Mike S?
141	Thanks, Kay
142	I'm speechless.
143	FYI.
143	Kathy is changing the address to 1400 Smith in the final version.
143	Kay
144	Please make the change.
145	Hi Richard, When you have 5 minutes I can bring you up-to-speed on the Westinghouse dispute.
145	Kay
146	You should have a closing party for this one.
147	Hope so.
147	We'll spare you extra emails until then.
148	Hi Jeff, Ozzie Pagan's team is working on a project for VEPCO.
148	The power plant will be located in Edgecombe County, North Carolina.
148	I've been told that getting gas for the plant is a significant issue due to local gas supply conditions.
148	One alternative has been to buy gas from the City of Rocky Mount, which has a take or pay contract with the local supplier, and is not using all of their gas, especially in the summer.
148	We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI, which I am attaching for your review.
148	I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to get your input, etc. Of particular concern is that Rocky Mount wants ENA to deal exclusively with them during the term of the LOI (this isn't reflected in the draft).
148	Thanks, Kay
149	Ben noticed a mistake in the ABB contract - one I missed.
149	Enron's address was listed as 1400 Louisiana.
149	I could not figure out where that address came from, as it had been correct before.
149	I asked Kathy and she told me that she changed it from Smith to Louisiana because she thought that was the correct address.
149	Ok, now I'm scared.
150	The change appears necessary since there is no 20.1 B. This must have been left over from the GE contract.
151	Anything from Mike?
152	Here is the answer to the storage charge question.
152	As you recall, the contract allows for us to request storage.
152	Kay
153	My understanding is that the ABB equipment will most likely be used somewhere other than Calumet due to the noise issue.
153	It is possible that LM 6000's will be used on Calumet, resulting in a re-bid of the EPC contract.
153	However, none of this is etched in stone, and their are active discussions with Peoples about what to do.
153	I suspect this isn't much help.
153	Paul probably has better information.
153	Kay
154	Michelle, I would like to sign up if there's still room.
154	Thanks, Kay
155	Hi Juan, I had another error message today.
155	The box was titled "cmd.exe", and the message was "directory name invalid".
155	My computer is working so far, just thought I would report this for future reference.
155	Have a good day, Kay
156	Allyson called Friday afternoon to tell me they would be sending this out Friday, and it needed to be reviewed quickly.
156	It never came.
156	I left a message Friday afternoon, asking where it was.
156	They sent it to me on Saturday.
156	I left out the really bad part.
156	I had to leave early on Friday because Michael's sitter (who picks him up from school everyday) had a heart attack.
156	She's still in St. Luke's.
156	I'll take a look at it.
157	Yes, I have it.
157	She thought she had heartburn while she was with Michael.
157	What a summer.
158	That would have been too much.
159	I've roughed out a document for you to discuss.
159	It isn't in good enough shape to go to Peoples yet, but hopefully it gives you something to discuss internally so we can decide what we want to do.
159	In the meanwhile, I'm going to continue to think through the issues.
159	Please let me know what I can do to help.
159	Kay
160	I want to verify that the relationship between VEPCO and NCP is sufficient to justify the statement that we are negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement with North Carolina.
160	As for the statement concerning ENA owning the other peaking projects, I could verify the correct Enron entities involved given a little time.
160	Perhaps we could work around it by saying that "ENA and its affiliates" are involved in these other projects.
160	I'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply.
160	Kay
161	Humberto, This is the most current version redlined against a previous version.
161	Kay
162	Here's a couple of clauses from some other contracts: From ABB contract: Maximum Liability.
162	Seller,s maximum aggregate liability for claims byPurchaser arising out of Seller,s performance of this Agreement whetherarising from tort (including negligence), breach of contract or any othercause of action is limited to one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Amount; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation of liability of Seller shall not apply to the following: (i) under Article XX (Indemnification); (ii) under Article XXIV (Liens and Claims); (iii) Section 3.8(a) and 3.8(b), (Compliance with Governmental Rules); (iv) Section 5.2 (Taxes); (v) Article XIX obligation to maintain insurance; (vi) arising from or related to environmental harm caused by an action orinaction of Seller, its agents, employees or Vendors during the performanceof the Scope of Work; (vii) resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller,their agents, employees or Vendors; (viii) patent or copyright infringement in accordance with Section 15.2, or (ix) Article XXI (Non-Disclosure of Information).
162	which liabilities shall not be limited.
162	Additionally, any liability of Seller provided for by the proceeds of the insurance maintained pursuant toArticle XIX shall not be counted toward any of the foregoing limitations ofliability.
162	The indemnity language in the ABB contract probably wouldn't work.
162	I'll loaround.
163	Allyson, Will the certification of necessity be specific to ENA?
163	I ask this because I suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be involved.
163	This provides us with the option of selling the equity of the entity developing the project.
163	Your advise is appreciated.
163	Kay
164	I can try!
165	here's one.
166	Thank you, Paul.
166	I appreciate your help.
167	I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess.
167	My responsibility ended when Tribasa IV was signed.
167	Kay
168	FYI.
168	I know it is because I'm new to the game, but I find this stuff interesting.
168	Kay
169	Attached is a draft of an LOI for the City of Rocky Mount.
169	Please let me know by tomorrow morning if you have any comments.
169	By the way, the exclusivity provisions are being re-examined, as CRM wants reciprocal exclusivity.
169	Thank you, Kay
170	I left Bruce a message offering my assistance.
171	FYI.
172	Hi Matt, You may have given this to me before, but I need a copy of the corporate data sheets.
172	Also, is there a standard slate of officers for ENA?
172	FYI, this company is jointly owned with another company.
172	Kay
173	Here's the latest from Gregg fyi.
174	FYI.
174	No action needed at this point.
174	Kay
175	I expect to have it today or tomorrow morning at the latest.
175	I understand that Mr. Dobler is out.
175	If so, Mike Miller is available to sign it.
175	Any new developments?
175	Kay Enron North America Corp.
176	Here's another draft: Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement (exh. A), termination rights, term.
176	I also made a minor change to dispute resolution.
176	As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very basic (see underlined language).
176	I just want to make sure we get the gas supply contract ASAP.
176	We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that helps.
176	I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.
176	I'll get the interconnection agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.
176	Hope you are having a good trip.
176	Kay
177	Hi Gregg, Here is a new draft which incorporates comments that Boyd and I have made.
177	I haven't reviewed this version yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap.
177	I would like to look at this draft before it goes to Peoples, and I'll give it priority for tomorrow am.
177	I spoke with Dave Gorde (RAC).
177	He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH at your convenience, although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC.
177	I'll go ahead and get a draft of a "simple" revolving line of credit doc started, unless you think otherwise.
177	Kay
178	Yes I can.
179	Nancy, As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants Enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.
179	Please put this on your list.
179	I will check around here to see if there is a form we want to use as a starting point.
179	Thanks, Kay
180	Well, I've lost today somewhere along the way.
180	How about Friday morning?
180	You and I can discuss the agency agreement, then get them on the line.
180	Anytime is good for me.
180	Kay
181	I should be able to accomodate the schedule.
181	Kay
182	Nancy, I don't have details on the meeting on the 20th, but please hold the date open for us.
182	Talk to you soon, Kay
183	FYI.
184	Mitch, Here's a first draft.
184	Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls which we need to raise.
184	It is better to be all inclusive than leave something out.
184	Richard, any ideas or comments?
184	Kay
185	I've left the Electricities lawyer a voice mail.
186	I just received this so I wanted to pass it along.
186	I'll work through the comments and get back to you with any questions.
186	Kay
187	Hi guys, I need the ABB contract and the PDA at your earliest convenience so that I can work on the documents we discussed.
187	Thanks, Kay
188	Viola!
189	Just a reminder: the contract gives us 30 days to give them written notice.
189	I'm not sure when the clock started ticking - the contract says something about the supervisory personnel at the facility becoming aware of the problem.
189	(paraphrasing, of course).
189	Enron North America Corp.
190	Not to suggest anything, but I'm going to try this for that stubborn 10-15lbs.
191	Weak excuse!
191	It lasts for 16 weeks...
192	Lisa Bills and I spoke concerning this transaction, and what kind of document we can put in front of Peoples at this time.
192	Here are the highlights from our conversation: Enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without putting the Moore project on the balance sheet.
192	Therefore, either WestLB needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an option agreement.
192	There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines; however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.
192	Lisa advises that Transaction Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.
192	I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the Moore project off the balance sheet.
192	I'm available to discuss this.
192	Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as well.
192	Lisa, please correct me if any of this is not accurate.
192	Kay
193	Good morning.
193	I'm looking for a confidentiality agreement between ENA and Peoples Energy Resources on or around Nov. 23, 1999.
193	Can either of you help me?
193	Thanks, Kay
194	per your request...
195	They should put pictures on resumes...
196	It the dark recesses of my mind I recall that Honey has a form to fill out.
196	However, that doesn't keep us from distributing $.
196	We just need to keep enough to pay CT to file the documents.
196	Congratulations, that was quite a feat.
196	Time for a Fish wake?
196	Kay
197	Matt, Please see if you can chase down the executed version of the first document.
197	Lou Stoler may know something.
197	You can also check with David Tucker at Thanks, Kay PS Did you ever figure out how original documents are handled around here?
198	FYI.
199	Here's a start...
200	I thought I would send this to you and you could just try to guess what we want to do.
201	Thank you.
201	More light reading!
201	Kay
202	Here's where I am: Kay
203	This is mostly just a template at this point.
203	Lisa has it as well.
203	Kay
204	Ok.
204	I'll send it.
205	Here's an outline of what I was thinking of using.
205	Obviously, there are huge holes in it, but I wanted to see if I'm on the right track.
205	Kay
206	I've made a rough stab at an exhibit to capture the changes which are necessary for the ABB contract.
206	Please comment on the attached, suggest changes, etc. I will add a rep.
206	or condition about receiving all the change orders, etc, FYI, I will be working on this over the weekend, should you care to comment.
206	Kay
207	Boyd, I am not sure you have seen this agreement.
207	If you haven't, please give it a look for "fatal flaws", or information you think we need to be informed.
207	Thank you, Kay
208	Hi Nancy, We are still on for Thursday with VEPCO in Richmond.
208	I would like for you to participate.
208	In addition, we would like the opportunity to meet with you before hand.
208	We can meet late Wednesday afternoon in DC.
208	How does that sound to you?
208	I look forward to speaking with you soon, Kay
209	I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.
209	I just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.
209	Thanks, Kay
210	Hi guys, Could someone send an electronic file of the execution copy of the Coyote Springs contract?
210	Thank you, Kay
211	Hi Nancy, There are some comments on the VEPCO ppa from our regulatory side.
211	I was unclear if you had seen these before.
211	Kay
212	I think I have everything except the termination agreement.
212	I'll check, and send you what I have.
213	If anyone would like to discuss the transaction this weekend, I can be reached at home at 713 973 6325.
213	Kay
214	FYI.
215	I see your point that the put should be higher up on the list.
215	In my opinion, this will be the biggest issue with ABB.
216	I think we will be staying in Richmond.
216	At least that was the plan as of Friday afternoon.
216	Heather Kroll will be meeting with us.
216	Kay
217	I thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by GE but not Enron) while I was in Ft.
217	Worth for my dad's surgery.
217	Marty mentioned that you were looking for them, so I thought he had given them to you (he's out this week).
217	I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned.
217	Did you and John leave fully executed termination agreements in my office?
217	Maybe someone else picked them up.
217	I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment.
217	Perhaps Peggy Banczak can help out with that.
217	Kay
218	Mom was asking my about cake, and I don't know what is on the menu for dessert.
218	Guess we can ask for cake.
218	Neil thought we should have cake at the PH.
218	Guess that makes sense, too.
218	You want to coordinate on when to get there?
218	That may be too out of character for all of us, but we can aspire to organization.
218	It is hot here, too.
218	The wind in the afternoon is really oppressive.
218	Dry heat - HA!
218	It is still darn hot.
218	I cringe at the thought of Six Flags.
218	I'm sure Paige can be bought.
218	She went recently and had a big time.
218	Hope your week is quiet.
218	Love/hugs, etc, to all, Kay
219	How bad is that.
219	I forgot I asked him to send it to you.
220	Hi Bob, Is there a favorite go by for an interconnection agreement?
220	I have one on my immediate to do list, and I want to point outside counsel in the right direction.
220	Thanks, Kay
221	I'm available anytime.
221	Enron North America Corp.
222	Good morning, Enron's finance people are asking about the status of the turbine contract for Pastoria.
222	Since Sheila is on vacation I thought I would check with you.
222	Is it in final form, and if so, has it been executed?
222	It would be a big help to get an electronic version sent to me.
222	Thanks, Kay
223	This is the contract that we said would be the jumping off point (an accurate description) for our GE discussions.
223	As I recall, we need to give it the off balance sheet treatment before it is distributed to the masses.
223	Rose, can you take responsibility for the basic OBS stuff?
223	I suggest we discuss assignment and indemnity separately (and soon).
223	My assistant is setting up the legal team's conference call for Wednesday at 830.
223	Details to follow.
223	Kay
224	Sounds great to me.
224	Enron North America Corp.
225	I threw the initials in there for your benefit.
225	It means Oh Bull Shit.
225	Kay
226	The following is a redline version of the execution version (so we hope) versus the last draft you saw.
226	Please advise if there are any Kay
227	Nancy, I believe we are scheduled to start at 900am Thursday.
227	I had a voice mail from Heather that said she was planning to spend the night Thursday in case the meeting went long, or we wanted to continue on Friday.
227	I haven't heard where we will be staying.
227	As for the interconnection agreement, it would be great to have a internal working draft this week.
227	That way we can discuss it with Heather and make good use of our time.
227	Also, we could have some general, preliminary discussions with VEPCO about it, if we feel ready.
227	I've been trying to get a form from someone around here, but haven't had any luck.
227	Perhaps someone BP's Houston office has an "Enron form".
227	Sheryl Gussett's name is next to "interconnection agreement" on our document team list.
227	Kay
228	As luck would have, I have to leave town this week.
228	I need to cancel this class.
228	Thanks, Kay
229	Hey, we all can use a little money.
229	Life doesn't seem to get any cheaper.
229	Honey, I think we discussed C T Systems doing the filing.
229	Do you recall how much it was?
229	If not, I can see what I can find out.
229	Which is more strange: Joe in Central America or Jack in Egypt?
229	Clark in Chicago?
229	Kay at Enron?
229	Gerry BUYING an engineering company?
229	Honey STILL at Sounds like a great time for a reunion.
229	Kay
230	FYI.
230	We are staying at the Richmond Marriott or Marriott Richmond, whichever it is.
230	What are your plans?
230	Kay
231	Nancy Wodka DC 202 8285000 is the main number Kay
232	FYI.
232	Kay
233	Thank you.
233	Kay
234	Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.
234	I feel into marathon meeting mode today.
234	Here are my observations of the GE contract.
234	I tried to confine it to significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.
234	General Terms and Conditions I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for performance/warranty issues.
234	Final payment is made at shipment, with the Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond expires at Provisional Acceptance.
234	There is no financial leverage for Final Acceptance or the warranty period.
234	Also, usually provisional or final acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.
234	The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.
234	I don't know the deal, so I don't know how it fits.
234	It can help to have language which allows for free assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs first.
234	Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.
234	Again, I don't know the deal so this may be fine as is.
234	The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a part of the contract, but does not give an order of precedence.
234	I haven't seen the proposal or any other technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.
234	Therefore, you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.
234	Warranty.
234	The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of the 1st and 2nd paragraph.
234	Also, the "outs" they have are very broad.
234	It is better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry practice).
234	Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a warranty claim.
234	A statement that they must provide a service engineer within 3 days or so might help.
234	I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty problems need to be explicit.
234	Excusable Delay.
234	(15) I would delete "indirectly" from the 3rd line.
234	Provisional Acceptance.
234	I don't understand the phrase "only to the extent and proportional share".
234	Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full LD's, or that the buyer has to prove a right to collect LD's?
234	Litigation.
234	The dispute resolution (mediation then litigation) is not consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.
234	I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.
234	13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.
234	For instance, I would delete or clarify the phrase "including that due to environment or operation", as being vague.
234	13.6 (i)The phrase "proper storage, installation, operation and maintenance" should be as defined by GE's written instructions, or at least based on industry standards.
234	13.6 (ii) could conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to get someone else to do the work.
234	14.1 The last line should include the words "strict liability" after "negligence".
234	GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they introduce.
234	This is a quick look.
234	If you need more detailed information (and you think there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.
234	Kay
235	What fun.
235	I know T. Mueller is on holiday.
235	I suspect he would want AI and St. Paul to agree in writing that this doesn't prejudice any rights/constitute a waiver, etc. You may have considered this already, but payment to /request for payment to EEPC may trigger the responsibility to pay VAT.
235	Good luck, and keep me posted.
235	Kay
236	Here's a revised draft of the agreement with Peoples.
236	Kay
237	Not me.
237	Bart, is it you?
237	Kay
238	Mr. Turner has the signed dissolution papers.
239	I have not responded yet, mostly because I don't know the answer.
239	Kay
240	Neat.
240	Thanks.
241	It might work better if you call.
241	Steve is very nice.
242	Just a reminder about our telephone call tomorrow morning.
242	Sheila left word that she won't be participating - something about being in St. Thomas.
242	Last I heard from Scott, he was on his way to the UK, but maybe he will be dialing in. Talk to you tomorrow.
242	Kay
243	A likely story.
243	By the way, what do you think of having Rob or someone OBS the Coyote Springs contract so we can use it as a starting point?
243	That would give me something to report.
243	Thanks, Kay
244	Hi.
244	I don't think I would have Rob participate in the call.
244	Just doesn't feel right.
244	I haven't heard any feedback from this morning's conference call.
244	Have you?
244	Kay
245	Brian Barto might have the info also.
245	I left Brian a voice mail and asked him to call you or me back with the info.
245	He is pretty bad about returning phone calls, though.
245	Kay
246	FYI.
247	Do you remember anything about this agreement?
247	It was something people were looking for while I was in Fort Worth, and now I'm trying to find the signed original.
247	Thanks, Kay
248	I just want to get it finished and off the to do list.
249	I just got a fax in from WestLB with a couple of changes.
249	(cringe) What's your fax number?
250	Please fax the Winston & Strawn changes to Kathy Clark.
250	Thanks, Kay
251	Hi Nancy, I've misplaced your direct line - could you email it to me?
251	The travel schedules of the Enron delegation are becoming complicated.
251	Would it be possible for you to travel with us to Richmond tomorrow night?
251	That would give us more flexibility in case we need to convene before the meeting on Thursday.
251	We are staying at the Marriott in Richmond.
251	Thanks, Kay
252	Jonathan, Please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the Public Staff, preferably by email.
252	I cannot locate the document here.
252	The LOI with Rocky Mount is still under discussion.
252	In a recent discussion with one of Enron's folks the City (or their lawyer) raised the issue that Kilpatrick Stockton had represented them in the past, and that there might be a potential conflict.
252	I don't anticipate a problem, but we should discuss it soon.
252	Thank you for your assistance, Kay
253	Thanks...
254	I'm still not sure who has this territory.
254	However, if you need something, please let me know.
254	Kay
255	I'm flying to Richmond this am.
255	I'll read the ABB contract on the plane, and let you know what I think this afternoon.
255	Hopefully, we can put it to bed.
255	Kay
256	Hi Clark, I'm in DC (in Bracewell's offices, in fact), and just picked up your email.
256	Has anyone taken you up on the offer?
256	If not, I'd be happy to take the tickets.
256	Thanks, Kay
257	Hi Herman, Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail.
257	We will change it so that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from Enron.
257	Anything else?
257	Thanks, Kay
258	Gentlemen, We have revised the option agreement to reflect most of your suggested changes.
258	Please advise if the attached is acceptable.
258	Thank you, Kay
259	Hi.
259	I'm working with Nancy Wodka on a deal with Virginia Power.
259	We are working on the PPA tomorrow.
259	Thanks for the offer of the tickets.
259	I'm sure Bob will enjoy the experience, even if the game is, well, an Astros game.
259	What a difference a year makes.
259	See you soon, Kay
260	Thanks.
260	I'm in DC (actually, Richmond VA) with Nancy Wodka working on a PPA.
260	I haven't opened the attachment yet due to the length of time it takes over this connection, and the late hour.
260	You may have addressed this in your email, but as I recall you were going to work on a summary of the restricted activities, as a foundation for the document anticipated by the LLC agreement.
260	Any luck with that?
260	I'll be in touch shortly.
260	Thanks for keeping track.
260	Kay
261	Hi Matt, This is the document that I referenced in my voice mail.
261	It would be great if it could be compared against the agreement for the Wilton Center.
261	I will call later to see if you've had any luck.
261	As you can guess, this is on a short fuse.
261	Thanks, Kay
262	Hi Fred and Suzanne, I'm sending this to Suzanne so she can make these changes.
262	Suzanne, you'll find the document attached to an email I received from Fred on July 11, entitled Kendall New Development LLC.
262	Here's my comments on the ComEd agreement: 4.
262	Change 100,000 to 50,000 (right, Fred?) 5.
262	Add "and the purchase order or contract will be assigned to Customer (or Customer's designee) at Customer's request, including the warranty provisions of such purchase order or contract" after costs on the 7th line.
262	9.
262	Add "for the purpose of performing its Scope of Work" to the end of the sentence.
262	10.
262	Add "internal and external" before legal counsel on 5th line.
262	16.
262	Add "Customer may assign this Agreement to an affiliate without consent" I'll be checking in. Thanks, Kay
263	Karen, Fred Mitro forwarded an email you sent him concerning a legal question.
263	Please be advised that Enron policy requires that all outside legal advice be coordinated through an inhouse lawyer, and certainly any legal advice given to Enron employees must be given to Enron counsel as well.
263	This requires some discipline on the part of our outside counsel, but we find it works in everyone's best interest.
263	Thank you for your attention to this very important policy.
263	Kay
264	Gee, if you hurry you can still make it to the volleyball game.
265	We had the legal call on Wednesday.
265	It was Mike, Kent and me.
265	You didn't miss much.
265	They are waiting on us, and I didn't want to give them anything we hadn't discussed internally.
265	I asked Rose to have the Coyote Springs contract OBS'ed (off balance sheet-ed).
265	She should have something shortly.
265	By the way, the contact sheet that Steve distributed was the one we prepared.
265	I'll catch you up on other stuff when you have time.
265	Nothing urgent...
265	Kay
266	Good morning, I'll check around for some peaker availability language.
266	If you would like, I can give a heads up to the finance group so that they know how quickly things will need to move.
266	I don't have any messages from Nancy yet, but I'm sure we will get a few today.
266	Kay
267	Any luck?
267	Thanks, Kay
268	Hi Lisa, I received your voice mail regarding the ABB contract.
268	As I recall, ABB signed the contract after I received approval from you (while we were on the phone on July 14 talking about the Moore project), Rose, and Herman, and had incorporated the comments sent by Rob Taylor.
268	Quite frankly, I thought that was it for the GF approval process, so WestLB's comments came as a surprise to me when they were faxed in a few days later.
268	I received a voice mail that indicated that ABB is ok with WestLB's changes.
268	I expect Enron may be signing today, and we will need WestLB's signature.
268	Please advise how this should be handled.
268	Kay
269	FYI.
269	Kay
270	I find the process a challenge to manage.
270	How's that for hyperbole?
271	Well, what can I say.
271	It represents job security for all of us!
272	Hi Heather, We can discuss these comments, if you want, or just incorporate them.
272	Electricities shouldn't mind.
272	Kay
273	I don't believe I forwarded this to you.
273	Kay
274	I'm not sure why this came to me, but I thought I would share it anyway.
275	Thanks for your help.
275	Kay
276	An email only a fellow turbine czarina could appreciate...
277	To tell you the truth, this stuff is difficult for me to retain, so I could be completely off base.
277	I would like to have Herman walk through it again.
278	tomorrow is probably better than Wednesday
279	Gentlemen, Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option agreement.
279	The most significant change is that it is clear that the option payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase price.
279	There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.
279	I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.
279	Please advise if this version is acceptable.
279	Also, please let me know if you would like for me to have a redline version prepared.
279	Kay
280	This is on the horizon, so I thought I would let you know.
280	Kay
281	Mike, I'll try to figure out the conversion.
281	In the meanwhile, if you can email me your fax number I'll send it that way.
281	Kay
282	Well, there's your summo wrestler, a fan, wasabi peas, and I think a sea shell.
283	They can't open the attachment.
283	Is there a way to save it in an earlier version of Word and resend?
283	Also, please print the attachment and fax it to Thanks, Kay
284	I got the same response from Mike and Ken.
284	Doesn't sound good.
285	Allyson, Thank you for the update.
285	Is not having the CPCN an absolute bar to beginning construction?
285	What are the risks?
285	Thanks, Kay
286	John, Credit appears to be a problem on this deal.
286	Therefore, please stand by for further developments.
286	I appreciate your very quick response.
286	Apparently, my client was satisified with the service he received.
286	Kay
287	Attached is the current draft of the PPA for the VEPCO deal for your information, review, etc. Kay
288	Here's the version showing revisions.
289	There were technical difficulties with the last one - this should be easier to read.
289	Kay
290	Here's a version: You probably know this, but the most important stuff is: assignment exercise dates (get more time than you could possibly need, because you'll need it) scope (if available), schedule guarantees option price not credited against purchase price (and lately, not refundable) Lisa Bills, Herman Manis, Rose Engeldorf and Matt Berry typically review these.
291	Suzanne, Please set up a conference call for tomorrow, 830 Houston time, and advise the following of the details: Sheila Scott Dieball Rose Engeldorf Kent Shoemaker Mike Barnas The last two are from GE.
291	Thanks, Kay
292	Any idea how close it is to B & P's office, and how much it costs?
292	Thanks, Kay
293	Tomorrow is bad for me, but Thursday afternoon or anytime Friday is good.
293	Kay
294	Karen, I have in hand the Ledford agreement.
294	My only comment is that on its face it does not appear to limit the Ledford's to the relief described (no sole/exclusive remedy clause).
294	Does that occur by operation of law in Illinois?
294	Thank you for your assistance.
294	Kay
295	Hi Rusty, Here's my only comment, which I sent directly to Karen.
295	Kay
296	I sent it to Ken and Mike.
296	They had difficulty opening it, but did get itopen this am.
296	I haven't heard back since then.
296	Herman wants to meet on Thursday or Friday to discuss structure.
296	What do ythink?
296	The Willard was booked, so I'm staying at the Monarch, near Nancy's office.I'm taking flight that gets to DC around 1100.
296	We received an email from Allyson that indicates that we may be able to getsome deadlines set so that the CPCN is issued by November 1.
296	She says it imuy mal to begin construction before it is issued.
296	Do you want to have a conference call this afternoon with Nancy to discussthe draft PPA?
296	Kay
297	Allyson says we can scratch around in the dirt a bit (I'm paraphrasing), so I'm sure some site preparation is ok.
297	I'm not sure I like her availability stuff as inserted.
297	Maybe we should leave some space for some wording, but not give them actual language today.
297	It is such a big issue, I hate for us to get into a box which won't work.
297	I'm going to check around again for the OEC stuff.
297	I still haven't seen anything.
297	I'll tell Nancy we will meet her in her office around 11:00.
297	As for meeting with Herman, should J Keenan be included as well?
297	Kay
298	Hi there.
298	I'm trying to put together a meeting on Thursday at 200 to discuss the VEPCO project.
298	How does 200 look for you?
298	Thanks, Kay
299	Herman says he has a lot of accounting issues to go over, and I thought it would be best if we all heard the same thing at the same time, plus, how the heck is this puppy going to get financed?
300	Amen.
300	To complicate things, the process is relatively new, so the originators/developers aren't experienced in working through it.
301	I don't see a problem with it.
302	Could you fax to Heather and Ozzie at the same fax as last night?
302	Thanks, Kay
303	I've just returned to the office, and will handle the changes as suggested.
303	Thanks, Kay
304	Nancy, Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!
304	I glanced through the interconnect.
304	It includes arbitration (poor Dutch) and equipment outage as force majeure.
304	Gee, what's good for the goose should be good for the gander.
304	Talk to you soon, Kay
305	Damn.
305	How do I find out what it is if I deleted the STUPID email?
306	Ed, Although this email was directed to EI lawyers, I was under the impression that this was a Corp policy.
306	Maybe I was wrong.
306	Kay
307	Gentlemen, I have made the revisions to paragraphs 16 and 22 as suggested.
307	I have also changed the state designation of the Tarheel notary to Texas.
307	If this version is acceptable, we will execute originals and forward to you.
307	Do you need more than one original for the optionor?
307	Thank you, Kay
308	Here's a list of the transactions that I can foresee in connection with the VEPCO deal.
308	Please feel free to add others: Kay
309	I've sent down the draft interconnection agreement we received from VEPCO for your review.
309	If you don't get it tomorrow, let me know.
309	Kay
310	We've reserved the two upstairs bedrooms which are connected by a porch with telescope.
310	Do you have a prefence as to which you want (just is case we get there early)?
310	You can look them up at We have Moonlight and Roses and Moonglow.
310	Ta ta for now, Kay
311	Hi Gaye, We are looking forward to seeing you and Earl this weekend.
311	We will have 9 for dinner, not counting the 6 year old who will have eaten (although he will eat a piece of bread, if offered).
311	I just hate to pay for a real dinner for him when I know he won't be interested in grown up food.
311	If it isn't too much trouble, could you email me the menu?
311	We will be bringing beer and wine.
311	See you soon (just not soon enough), Kay Mann
312	Allyson, The nondisclosure agreement is acceptable for the our purposes at this time.
312	Kay
313	YUMMY
314	I don't have an electronic version yet either.
314	If you don't get it today, I'll fed ex a copy to your office for when you return.
315	Nancy, I've made a list of the transactions I see in the VEPCO deal.
315	Perhaps you can think of more.
315	I would appreciate your suggestions for B & P lawyers to assist with these various aspects of the deal, with local counsel input as necessary.
315	Additionally, I would like to have someone in the Houston office involved for backup.
315	last minute meetings, etc. Thanks for your help.
315	Here's my list: Power Purchase Agreement with Virgina Power (VEPCO) Interconnection Agreement (VEPCO) Sale of land to the City of Rocky Mount (CRM) Possible Annexation Agreement (CRM) Payment in Lieu of Taxes Agreement (CRM) Gas Supply Agreeement (CRM) Land lease (CRM) Fuel supply (oil) EPC Contract (NEPCO or other) Assignment of turbine contract (GE?) Purchase of other long lead items Permitting Operations and Maintenance Agreement
316	Clark, FYI.
316	Kay
317	Mitch, Has the letter gone out?
317	Kay
318	Well, I believe I'll bring something cool, comfortable, and casual.
318	Or, maybe jeans.
318	I don't have a very large selection, since most of my clothes are either work clothes or beyond casual (yard stuff).
318	I have a couple of Hawaiian shirts, so I'll probaly pick one of those.
318	Neil will wear shorts and probably a Hawaiian shirt, since that is what he almost always wears when he isn't working!
318	What do you want to do about lunch tomorrow?
318	I can bring something, or we can just tell Mom we ate on the way.
318	You know how she frets about such things.
318	Or, we could pick up Sonic if someone is hungry.
318	We'll have some type of snacks for Michael, I guess, since he's at the age where he eats constantly.
318	HMMMM.
318	More to think about!
319	Hi again, I just called Mom and told her our plans.
319	She says Dad has no clue.
319	She vacuumed on Monday or Tuesday, and he asked her who she was expecting to visit the next day.
319	HA HA HA.
319	I told her that we are all very proud of ourselves for not blowing it.
319	Dad doesn't know I called today, so I can call him tomorrow when we are on the way, talk to Mom and let her know when we will be there.
319	It won't be that weird for me to call on a Saturday morning.
319	She say Larry and Beverly left today, so we can park in their driveway and be sneaky.
319	I'm so excited!!!
319	Kay
320	We need to keep in mind the 30 day deadline to provide notice.
320	We don't want to give them any room to wiggle.
320	We can always send another notice later.
320	Kay Enron North America Corp.
321	Since I've had to miss the first 2 meetings due to travel, is it possible for me to drop off my check and pick up any materials?
321	Thanks, Kay
322	No. I'll have Neil check (he does all that stuff).
323	3850, through the wooden doors.
323	Enron North America Corp.
324	I hope I'm in town!
325	FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co., said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7 billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company.
325	The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27 billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and $10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said.
325	The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies.
325	Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of a new holding company for each FPL share held.
325	Entergy shareholders would get 0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share.
325	Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share.
325	FPL shares closed Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8.
325	Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators.
325	FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 15 months.
325	``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J. Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive.
325	Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman.
325	The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57 percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of directors, the companies said.
325	Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110 million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs.
325	Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said.
325	FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts.
325	In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans, together worth $1 billion.
325	FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said.
326	Kathy, I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, and will therefore be unable to attend.
326	Thank you, Kay
327	Suzanne, Please schedule this week's conference call for 930am on Wednesday, and include the usual suspects: Sheila, Scott, Rose, Mike Barnas and Kent Shoemaker.
327	Thanks, Kay
328	Hi.
328	I'm kinda tired this morning.
328	I guess I just need a bit more sleep.
328	Michael tried to push the envelope this am.
328	He wanted to eat some more after he had brushed his teeth (I told him breakfast was over, so no more food) and wanted to go back in to get a toy to take (nope).
328	He handled the frustration Do we have anything planned this weekend?
328	Ta ta for now,
329	Attached is the form interconnection agreement provided by Virgina Power, for your information, review, etc. It is a new form which is currently under review by VEPCO.
329	Kay
330	I'm trying to locate a copy of the contract to purchase the 501D5A turbine to see if we need to be aware of any issues in the contract.
330	Do you have a copy?
330	If not, I can probably get a copy from EECC.
330	Thanks, Kay
331	Both of those sound pretty good.
331	Paige is so excited.
331	She got a $1000 pay check.
332	I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.
332	Do we have a company for New York yet?
332	If not, I seem to recall that we were going to start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of creating a new one every time.
332	Am I remembering that correctly?
332	Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.
332	Any suggestions?
332	Thanks, Kay
333	IT IS RAINING!!!
333	I hope it is raining at the house.
333	It looks like it probably is raining all over town.
333	Hope you get some there.
333	Neil's address is nmann@erac.com.
333	Paige's address is recordp@southwestern.edu.
333	She can get her email from Houston (don't ask me how).
333	We had a great time this weekend, too.
333	I'm glad it worked out so well.
333	I thought it was very relaxing.
333	I would love to have the recipe for the beef.
333	I will probably go to North Carolina Wednesday, returning Thursday or Friday.
333	Take care!
333	Love, Kay
334	Sheila stopped by to let me know that it is ok for me to give you a hand on the lease term sheet.
334	I've stopped by a couple of times today, but I've missed you.
334	Please let me know if you still want my help, and if so, if you have any additional information, etc. Thanks, Kay
335	Yes and yes.
335	Enron North America Corp.
336	Here it is.
336	I guess she didn't make my reservations.
336	You might want to double check.
336	Obviously, I do not need a car.
336	I would like to get these reservations asap for the upgrade.
336	Thanks, Kay
337	Ed, To clarify, the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina.
337	The New York deal is a separate deal.
337	Thanks, Kay
338	I've made a list of issues Heather and I have discussed based on VEPCO's suggested revisions.
338	Some of the issues are commercial, some legal, somejust reminders.
338	Comments are appreciated.
338	1.
338	Term.
338	What will we accept?
338	2.
338	Availability: single computation despite source of power (market or facility).
338	Is forced outage the correct concept since we want to have somediscretion, and LD structure should apply even if power coming from the market?
338	Note VEPCO,s insertion of a new event of default under 7.1 forfailure to deliver energy when the Facility is not in a forced outage.
338	Liquidated damages language still ok?
338	LD,s should apply regardless ofscheduled source of power ) no cost of cover for market power.
338	3.
338	Our position is that Contract Capacity set at contract signing, then adjusted (if necessary) based on performance tests, not subject to adjustmeafter that time: ditto for the demand charge.
338	What is the right number forthe Capacity?
338	Is there a benefit to Enron to have a correction curve exhibit?
338	4.
338	Failure to complete facility suggested as a termination event.
338	Is September long enough?
338	5.
338	We need to be able to supply from either or both sources (market and facility) during a day, but this doesn,t give us right to change during the day after the schedule is set.
338	6.
338	Note the Start Up definition (as suggested by VEPCO) and how it is applied.
338	Reject 50% requirement at this point, subject to their explanatio7.
338	Note: construction of the facility now required (2.3).
338	8.
338	Define commercial operation.
338	9.
338	Confirm that Enron has sufficient protection from interconnection 10.
338	Day ahead scheduling (3.4) Are we ready to commit?
338	11.
338	Number of start ups.
338	(2.3 e) 12.
338	Force majeure ) consistency with interconnection agreement, relief for certain equipment failures.
338	Is concept logically developed throughout thedocument?
338	Note distinction between market and facility power in force majeure language.
338	13.
338	Dispute resolution: arbitration vs. litigation/venue.
338	Virginia law?
338	14.
338	Change in law.
338	Counter with CIL as termination event?
338	15.
338	Exhibit A ) Heather is working on this.
338	Kay
339	Sounds good.
339	We may not need the entity in New York yet, as we are looking at getting a free option, not anonymous.
339	Deals kind of funky.
339	Correct on the Edgecombe (North Carolina) thing.
339	Kay
340	I don't think this agreement will be on the agenda until next week.
340	If things change (moving up or back), I'll let you know.
340	Thanks, Kay
341	Let me think about it.
342	I disagree.
342	NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be attributed to changes.
342	There was no explanation given as to why they booked me to return a day early on the first trip to DC.
342	What was up with that?
342	Last week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.
342	In fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had before.
342	A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.
342	That is what business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying around North America, South America and Europe.
342	I've had good agents and bad ones.
342	The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.
342	Please have my flight changed as follows: Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no.
342	1882, departing IAH at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.
342	The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.
342	Thanks, Kay
343	I'm scheduled to fly back to Houston around 745 that night, so it isn't looking good for me.
343	Enron North America Corp.
344	I wasn't blaming you.
344	I was just disagreeing with the statement that that changes have caused the problem.
345	She may turn out to be great, just because she becomes extra cautious with us.
346	Any luck with this?
347	I don't recall the answer was to the question about whether we have a land company in New York?
347	And if so, its name?
347	Thanks, Kay
348	After I wrote this I recall Ed saying that we don't have a New York company yet.
348	I'm fairly comfortable that I don't know whether there really is an Edgecombe Development Company, and if so, is it available to use on the Virginia Power transaction.
348	Sorry for the memory slip.
348	Kay Enron North America Corp.
349	Hi Kay, I trying to find out if we have confidentiality agreements with the following: Virginia Power Dominion Resources (or something close) Electricities (don't know the remainder of the name) North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency Thanks, Kay
350	Gee, makes you wish there was a way to track documents without having to speak to someone.
350	(do I sound like a broken record yet?) I'm fairly confident we can use this company, as the project I am handling is Lisa's old project.
350	There's time to wait for her to answer, though.
351	Do you have a copy of the one with Virginia Power?
351	Thanks, Kay
352	Please protect Thursday afternoon, August 10th for me.
352	I have some important personal stuff to take care of.
353	I spoke with Kent Shoemaker, and he has a conflict at 930 Houston time today.
353	I suggested to him that Enron go forward with the call as an internal call, and we can conference him in after 1000 (when he's available), if we have anything noteworthy to report.
353	If that is acceptable, I will go to Sheila's office at 930, and we can call Scott and Rose.
353	How does that sound?
353	Kay
354	I need this document today in a big way.
354	Can you assist in getting it located?
354	If Kay doesn't have it, it is possible that Lisa Mellencamp might.
354	Thanks, Kay
355	Michael problems.
355	He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.
355	We are going to meet with the specialist next week.
355	I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.
355	We are thinking of changing his school, and Neil and I need to go visit a new one.
355	HECTIC!
356	Due to the nature of this deal, I've prepared an LOI with an exclusivity period.
356	Let me know what you think, Kay
357	We've known, but is has gotten to be a bigger issue as he has gotten older.
358	I am attaching a operating lease summary which I have revised to include some basic asset operation stuff.
358	I've left Lisa a voice mail with a brief explanation of what we are doing, and asking her if she would take a look at this from a financing "fatal flaw" standpoint, with Enron being the lessor.
358	I've been summoned to Nowhere North Carolina (Rocky Mount) for the remainder of the day and tomorrow, and will be back on Friday am.
358	Anne, I hope this helps keep you moving.
358	Lisa, many, many thanks.
358	Kay Kay
359	I suspect that there are several options.
359	He is such a sweet, cute, smart thing.
359	You will like him.
359	He is very very charming.
360	Let's just assume I'll be out Friday afternoon.
361	Hi Cheryl, I'm looking for the executed version of the contract with Westinghouse for the 501D turbine, which I believe was originally headed to Panama.
361	ENA is looking to use it in a project or two, and I need to give a look.
361	An electronic version would be fine.
361	Thanks, Kay
362	Here's something to work with: Virginia Power and ENA agree that Virginia Power will authorize and pay for the ________ so that the queue (que?) spot for necessary interconnection (RIGHT?) will be maintained.
362	ENA agrees that should ENA (or its affiliate) fail to complete negotiations and excute a power purchase and sale agreement, it will reimburse Virginia Power up to half of the cost of the _______ [Heather, this is a study (ie, soft cost) right?], not to exceed a reimbursement of $15,000.
363	Great.
363	I'm gone.
363	I'll have my cell phone on later.
364	Friday am is the only time this week that works for me.
365	Here's what I sent to Rusty on Wednesday.
365	It seemed like an option didn't quite fit, since PACS doesn't have anything to option, strictly speaking.
365	Kay
366	How transparent is that?
367	Hi Lupe, I heard a rumor that Tribasa had found somebody to buy out the loan.
367	Another victim, perhaps?
367	I can't imagine how you must have felt to get a call from Don.
367	Maybe he's looking for a new opportunity in Mexico, since Bufete didn't pan out.
367	I've been busy working on a read deal with some very bright commercial people.
367	It is very challenging.
367	Sometimes I feel so uninformed.
367	This is a nice change!
367	I feel like it is elevating my professional development.
367	I ran into Chip recently.
367	He seems happier now that he has Erik's old job.
367	More hugs - Kay
368	Gentlemen, Any progress on the summary?
368	Thanks, Kay
369	Hi Karen, Did I mess up?
369	I saw Herman and he told me that the 1000am was held.
369	I hope I wasn't supposed to be there.
369	Please call if I can help.
369	Kay
370	Please send me a copy of the data sheet on the above company.
370	Thanks, Kay
371	Nancy, Please incorporate this language from Enron's Tax Guys.
371	Thanks, Kay
372	Scott's done the difficult part and generated something for review.
372	I've added my comments.
372	Sheila, would you like to add your 2 cents worth?
372	Thanks, Kay
373	Allyson, As you know, we have had discussions with the City of Rocky Mount regarding possibly buying gas from them for the new power plant in Edgecombe County.
373	Evidently, the gas company has figured this out, and is not happy with this prospect.
373	We would like your opinion concerning the City's ability to (a) require that a tap be made so that the power plant be served and (b) sell gas to Enron for this purpose.
373	When considering these issues, please assume that the City would own and annex the land, and lease it to an Enron entity.
373	We will need the gas by next March or April, so time is critical.
373	Should the gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be expected to take?
373	Do you have any suggestions for expediting the process?
373	I am having the contracts between the gas company and the City sent to you, and you should have them by Monday.
373	Thank you for your assistance, Kay
374	I wish I could say that's the reason we haven't heard anything.
374	I suspect we would have heard if they had a problem with it being WordPerfect.
374	I hope this doesn't mean they haven't tried to open it yet.
374	I have complained about EECC Contracts using WordPerfect.
374	As far as I know, it is the ONLY Enron group still using it.
374	EECC Legal uses Word.
374	I always figured this WordPerfect thing was intentional, which is why I had WordPerfect loaded on my computer.
374	I don't think I can make the conversion from home due to download problems.
374	I will see that you get a converted copy.
374	Kay
375	Hmm.
375	What hotel would be the closest to the Willard?
375	(other than the Marriot, which I'm not wild about because it is so big) What does the Hay Adams have?
375	Alternatively, what do you suggest in Georgetown?
375	Do you know if anyone else from Enron has stayed there (the Four Seasons) recently?
375	Thanks for asking, by the way.
376	I'm travelling on Monday, so please ask my assistant, Suzanne Adams for a copy.
376	I'm new to this particular group in Legal, so I'm still learning who does what.
376	No offense intended.
376	This deal has a lot of life and potential, so I look forward to getting to know you in the process.
376	Kay
377	The attached is the version of the contract which is under internal review and has therefore not been sent to VEPCO.
377	Warning: the black lining may not be much help to you, depending on which version you last reviewed.
377	We are meeting with VEPCO on Tuesday to iron out the remaining issues, and would like to send them this version in advance of that meeting Monday afternoon.
377	With apologies for the short notice, any input you might want to give would be appreciated.
377	We would like to send them this version (with internal revisions) in advance of that meeting.
377	Therefore, please email me any proposed changes, or leave me a voice mail at x57566.
377	FYI: The goal is to have this part of the deal completed prior to August 22.
377	Thank you for your assistance, Kay
378	Hi again, I checked my maps of DC, and it looks like the Hotel Washington might be a good alternative.
378	Could you see what they have for Mon/Tues night?
378	Also, please check back with the Willard to see if they have had any cancellations.
378	Could you email me your telephone number and the afterhours number?
378	Due to the shortage of time, please call me with any information you might have.
378	I should be in my office from 830 until 930.
378	Ex 57566 If I'm not there, I'll be checking messages.
378	Thanks, Kay
379	Feel free to copy all you want, assuming there is nothing too compromising!
380	A small step for man...
381	Hi Suz, Please print email and attachment, and fax to me at the Willard.
381	I'm in room Thanks, Kay PS How was Pappas?
382	Good job Ric!
383	Hi Ben, Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through on the change order.
383	I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not sooner.
383	As you can see, I'm picking up email, and can also be reached on my cell phone.
383	I reviewed your email re: VEPCO.
383	We do have a project entity to use, and Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off balance sheet issues.
383	I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee soon.
383	It was good to get your input on VEPCO.
383	There's lots to do on that one.
383	Kay
384	Sorry to miss your birthday.
384	Did you have one in my honor?
384	You know I really did have one for you on vacation.
384	Points well taken - some we have already addressed, others probably need to be tied up better.
384	See you soon.
384	By the way, it hailed in DC today.
384	Looked good from the bar at the Willard.
384	Kay
385	Hi Carlos, I'm back in DC, at the Willard, so I'm thinking of you.
385	We (the commercial leads and I) will be in Richmond tomorrow for negotiations, then back tomorrow night at the Willard.
385	I hope things are ok for you.
385	I know it is probably stressful.
385	Hang in there.
385	Kay
386	This is so sad.
386	But then again, God works in very mysterious ways.
386	If things are going to fall apart soon anyway....
386	Jim and his family have been in my prayers.
386	This must be very hard.
387	Most hotels have a 4 to 6 oclock the same day policy.
387	That's pretty awful.
388	I agree that we need a "standard" way of moving the turbines (and transformers) into other structures.
388	Both the GE contract for the LM 6000's and the ABB transformer contract envision such moves.
388	In addition, the ADA's with WestLB anticipate these moves.
388	I'm sure you've heard plenty about all of this.
388	I've been working on developing on some of the forms required to take some of this - Global Finance will coordinate other aspects of it.
388	I believe we are in pretty good shape conceptually to take care of all of it, but we should plan 2 to 4 weeks to get the documents completed.
388	I don't see any problem with this - I just wanted you to be aware of some of the logistics.
388	I'll be in the office tomorrow if you would like to discuss this.
388	Kay
389	I can understand how that can be a problem.
389	Certainly, every effort can be made to expedite the process, and I do think the first time will take the longest for obvious reasons.
389	For the purposes of scheduling going forward, I think it would help to keep that type of time frame in mind, with the thought that maybe it can happen more quickly.
389	Kay
390	Hi Gregg, I'm back.
390	I don't know what the deal was with my cell phone this week.
390	Perhaps the problem was the weak signal in the area.
390	Several people commented that they had problems reaching me, and my phone was on almost the entire time.
390	In fact, I made many calls, but I ususally checked to see if I had a signal first.
390	Sorry for the inconvenience.
390	I'll take a look at the DASH, etc, and get up to speed so that I can speak intelligently.
390	Kay
391	FYI.
392	Bob, Here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal.
392	I don't know how much good it will do you, but at least it gives you some tax language.
392	As I mentioned, the last deal was supposed to be a "wire me money, I'll sell you stuff" deal, but it didn't happen.
392	I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up, if possible.
392	Kay
393	FYI.
394	I don't think she finished her thought.
394	I'll check with Allyson on this.
394	Kay
395	Allyson, Thank you for the email.
395	It seems to stop in mid sentence, so I was wondering if maybe something got deleted?
395	We have an interest in having the application for the CPCN amended to be less specific on the equipment we will be using.
395	I believe Jeffrey may have mentioned this to you before.
395	We would like to follow up with that now, unless there is some significant problem with it.
395	Thank you, Kay
396	I have meeting with a different specialist for Michael next Wednesday at 430.
396	I will need to leave by 345.
397	Hi Nancy, I am planning to make the changes which arose out of our meeting with VEPCO.
397	When we met with them, we agreed that we would accept all the changes in this draft, then blackline against it.
397	I tried to do this to this document, then realized that this is a compared document as opposed to a draft marked with changes.
397	Can you email me unmarked version which contains all these changes, and I'll start from there.
397	I apologize if I already have the clean draft, but I want to be certain that I am working from the correct version.
397	Thanks, Kay
398	Allyson, Thank you for your prompt response.
398	Can you describe the process and timing for filing a project update?
398	Thanks, Kay
399	I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.
399	I just wanted some extra quiet time.
400	Absolutely.
400	Morning is better for me, as I have a meeting at 230 this afternoon.
400	I spent some time with Rose and Humberto yesterday, discussing the logistics and options in connection with this and City of Austin.
400	Kay
401	Hi Kathy, I'm in the office today, if you want to finish up ABB.
401	Ben Jacoby and Jody Pierce will need copies, if you will be making copies for distribution.
401	We can talk about the LM6000 change order #2, also.
401	Thanks, Kay
402	Gentlemen, I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on certain tasks.
402	Here goes: Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.
402	Roy is putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.
402	Gregg and I decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.
402	Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's review.
402	Here's the draft: Gregg and I need to review it.
402	Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.
402	Since both sides are running behind on this, David prepared a very straight forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing the task.
402	Here it is: Policies - Gregg "Policy Man" Penman has been working on a credit policy, cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of others I'm forgetting.
402	Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.
402	He has raised the issue of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.
402	Also, it may be necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid before any distributions are made to either member.
402	This is still under internal review at Enron.
402	I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) has a form of credit facility we should use.
402	Miscellaneous: Decide about services agreement Confidentiality agreements Transfer pricing documentation Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master) Board resolution appointing officers/managers Budget and marketing plan Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list) Hope this is helpful.
402	Kay
403	Hi there, Could you please print these for me?
403	Thanks.
403	FYI: I'm going to antitrust training from 230 to 430.
403	Bet you are jealous.
403	Kay
404	Attached is a recent version of the VEPCO PPA, which is currently be revised.
404	Hope it is helpful.
404	Kay
405	I haven't heard a word about this deal lately.
405	This is why I never throw anything away.
405	Kay
406	David, How about 400 this afternoon?
406	I have another call at 230, but it should be over by then.
406	Kay
407	FYI.
407	As I'm sure you've figured out, this is VEPCO.
408	Hi Ken, I have two tickets available for Saturday night if you still want them, at $25/each.
408	Just email me back, and I'll bring the tickets tomorrow.
408	Thanks, Kay
409	Sounds good to me.
409	I'm in EB 3850.
410	Hi guys, I want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being provided by Piper Rudnick, so that there won't be any surprises when the bill comes in. Could you give me a brief outline of their scope?
410	Thanks, Kay
411	Here's the Risk Management Policy Gregg has been working on for MEH.
411	Jeff, I don't know if you have seen this, so I thought I would float it by you.
411	David, I'm sending it to you so that you can comment about any concerns you might have relating to the LLC agreement.
411	Thanks, Kay
412	Sheila, For your information.
413	Gregg, 330ish looks good for both David and me.
413	If you would like to call me, we can conference in David.
413	Thanks, Kay
414	Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.
414	They had Mon/Thurs available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.
414	Besides, Delmis may be able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on Friday.
414	Our driver's name is David.
414	His cell phone is 713 545 4186.
414	We can call him if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.
414	He will leave us a sack today.
414	How's that for cool?
414	Kay
415	Please compare this new document: to this old draft, and create a redline: Thanks, Kay
416	Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.
416	I'll try to remember next time.
417	Here's the most recent version of the document formerly known as the PPA: Kay
418	I got my hair cut - it feels so good to get it cut.
418	I'm planning on going as scheduled.
418	Do lots of people go to this?
419	What was I thinking??????
420	Sounds good.
420	I'm on a conference call that won't end.
420	I received your fax and will try to call you this afternoon.
421	Do I have original, initialled documents to which I can add the signature pages?
421	You may have given this to me already...
421	Thanks, Kay
422	Here's the clean version (no redline) of the most recent draft of the PPA.
422	I have no idea what happened with the redline, but I'll try to get a decent one done.
423	What can I say?
423	Here's the tubine torture possibilities as they exist at this point in time.
424	I am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known as the PPA.
424	This is compared against the August 7 draft.
424	I am sending it without anyone else reading it (a gutsy and foolhardy move), so it is subject to further Enron review.
424	Thanks, Kay
425	This is HILARIOUS!
425	And so true.
425	We are doing fine here in the sauna, despite the heat and horrible pollution.
425	No big news to report, which is good.
425	Hope all is well with your bunch.
425	Give Lou a howdy and a hug for me.
425	Kay
426	From Bev.
426	Pretty good stuff.
427	Hi Dutch, My email did not go through to Jeff or John.
427	Could you please forward it to them for me?
427	Thanks, Kay
428	I may be on the road tomorrow (won't know until later), so something early afternoon Friday would be best for me.
428	Thanks, Kay
429	In speaking with Allyson, she believes we need to have the responses the Public Staff's data request no later than sometime next week.
429	The Staff wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during the week of August 28th.
429	Therefore, Allyson suggests that we have a call this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together.
429	Sounds like a good idea.
429	Please let me know when you are available for the call this week.
429	I suspect it will take between 30-45 minutes.
429	Also, please let me know if you have NOT received a copy of the data request, as these should have arrived via company mail.
429	Thanks, Kay
430	Hi there, When I was at Monday's Astros' game, I thought I heard them say that Enron is sponsoring some type of kid's book drive at next Sunday's game.?
430	I have quite a few gently used kids books I am looking to give away, so I was wondering if I could do it in connection with that program.?
430	I will not be at the game Sunday, and I didn't locate a reference to the program on your website.
430	Is there a way for me to donate kids books for whatever program Enron is sponsoring, without going to the game?
430	Many thanks!
430	Kay Mann
431	Hooray.
431	If I'm paid up with Hays McConn through the month, I'll continue with it until the end of August.
431	If we move Michael to public school and save a $100 on parking, things may start to add up!!!
431	We could pay for a nice little trip somewhere....
432	Will you be in Friday?
432	If so, could you help me remember to pick up my parking card.
432	I FINALLY got a slot at the Met.
432	Thanks, Kay
433	I'm flying to somewhere (probably DC) tonight, returning on Friday.
433	Ozzie is making the travel arrangements, so you don't need to do anything.
433	I'll let you know what else I find out.
433	Thanks, Kay
434	Virginia Power has raised a question about wanting some type of guaranty or other form of performance security should an Enron LLC sign the contract.
434	What can we propose (or exclude) under the contemplated structure?
434	Thanks, Kay
435	Attached for your information/review is the latest draft of the VEPCO contract.
435	Thanks, Kay
436	I'm headed to Virginia tonight, and should be back Friday am.
436	Could we push back the conference call to the afternoon?
436	Heather will have the same travel schedule.
436	Thanks, Kay
437	I'll keep in touch!
438	My copy printed completely.
438	Let me see what's up.
439	Thanks for the input.
439	I'll see what we can figure out.
440	appt is at 430.
440	i wanted to leave at 345
441	Please resend the August 15 redline to the Virginia Power people on the list I gave you.
441	Thanks, Kay
442	You know how Remote Control!!!!!!!
442	How fun!!!
443	NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.
443	Is this a lump sum deal?
443	If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to both LOL and retention.
443	A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense.
443	Another factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE contract.
443	Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?
443	I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.
443	Kay
444	Kathy, Could you please accommodate Karen's request?
444	If you would like, you can just send it to me and I will get it to her.
444	If you have delivered my original to me I can make make her a copy.
444	Thanks, Kay
445	I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project.
445	We are currently working on the mechanics relating to that.
445	It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and I'm currently in meetings where I'm using my hard copy.
445	How soon do you need it?
445	Kay
446	I don't know if he has the financing docs.
447	Hi Mike, In a meeting Friday afternoon with Ben Jacoby, he mentioned that he didnt want the change order signed quite yet.
447	I suspect he wants to review it before it is signed, and he's on vacation this week.
447	Kay
448	Kathy, I believe Ben needs to initial the change order, and he's on vacation this week.
448	Kay
449	Here it is: Please let me know if you have any problems with this document.
449	Kay
450	HELP!
450	What's my R/C number?
450	Is it 00406373?
450	Does that look like an RC?
450	We need to get an invoice from the travel agency Heather and Ozzie used for my flights last week.
450	I know the travel agent's name is Julie, but I don't know the details.
450	The agency is something like Vitol.
450	I suspect Claudette can give you the telephone number, etc. I would have gotten a receipt from Continental, but the E ticket machine wasn't working.
450	I have the rest of the receipts.
451	I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.
451	It seems that we could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out of their scope under the agreement.
451	I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve out.
451	I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with industry standards.
452	Just to catch you up a bit...
453	27.5 Separate Advice or Assistance.
453	If Seller furnishes Purchaser with advice or assistance which is clearly not required by this Agreement, Selleshall not be subject to any liability whether in contract, warranty, tort(including negligence or strict liability without regard to fault), indemnior otherwise in connection with Seller,s provision of such out of scope of service advice or assistance, so long as such advice or assistance is givenin good faith and in accordance with industry standards.
454	Hi Rob, I think we would prefer if you would route the document back this way, and Sheila or I will send it to the folks at GE.
454	Thanks, Kay
455	Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on O. It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.
455	It should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.
455	Please go search and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.
455	I started making the changes, but got distracted from the task.
455	Thanks, Kay
456	I'm scheduled to be here.
456	Tomorrow and Wednesday are pretty bad, but Thursday and Friday are wide open.
456	Kay Enron North America Corp.
457	Karen, Please forward the revisions once you get them.
457	Thanks, Kay
458	FYI.
459	I'm going to miss you really badly.
459	Are you sure you want to go to the cool air, unwind, sip wine and eat delicious food?
459	And miss all this???????
460	I shouldn't have looked at that when I'm so hungry.
460	What an incredible menu - and in a relatively small town.
460	You better take a wad of fatburners!!!
461	Just being out of this nasty smog will be great.
461	Plus, I bet it is nice there when the sun goes down.
461	What a great time of year to make that trip.
461	Can you hear my heavy sighs?
461	It is time for me to plan something fun, even a short trip.
461	Planning and looking forward to it is 1/2 the fun.
462	Here's where we stayed on our honeymoon www.whalewatchinn.com
463	I have an extra I can send you today.
463	Kay
464	Thursday afternoon would be best for me.
464	Enron North America Corp.
465	Just a reminder to send me the description you gave the school.
466	Hi Brian, What a great surprise!
466	Life is pretty good.
466	To see a summary, you might want to check out Paige's website: (I tried to copy that as a link, but I think I messed up.) I guess Peggy told you (or you figured out from my email address) that I'm working at Enron.
466	I like it.
466	I enjoy being back downtown after being a suburban lawyer.
466	Home life is relatively calm, which has always been a goal of mine.
466	I'm dealing with my folks getting older, with the health problems which come with that process.
466	Overall, I'm very blessed and happy.
466	How about you?
466	If you are spending time at HM, you must still be doing the law thing.
466	I might have lost a bet on that one.
466	So how's your life?
466	Paige completed her minor in German.
466	Consider it a Wunder legacy!
466	Her brother, Michael is a real charmer.
466	You would get a huge kick out of him.
466	Thanks so much for writing.
466	I can't wait to hear what is going on with you.
466	Kay
467	Hi Guys, Is the 501D in storage?
467	If not, when will it be delivered?
467	I'm asking in connection with information to be provided in the CPCN process.
467	Thanks, Kay
468	Could we benefit from an internal meeting prior to the call?
468	Kay
469	We are at the MOU stage.
469	Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday.
469	Commercial leads at ENA and Global Finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment.
469	The information I was given is that we want to get it done by the end of September.
469	How does this sound?
469	Kay PS Also includes 2 transformers.
470	Heather, Did you want to send this?
470	Anything else you want to add?
471	LM's # 1-6, 19-20, plus a couple of ABB transformers.
472	Bill, I'm attaching an electronic copy of the letter we sent to Westinghouse.
472	If you email me your fax number, I'll fax you their response.
472	Thanks, Kay
473	Hi there, Paige is still here.
473	I think she may leave tomorrow.
473	Have you ever visited her website?
473	Here's a link: You might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her web page.
473	She will have the same email address again this year.
473	I suspect she will have the same mailing address as well, since it is a box number.
473	Michael slept well this weekend.
473	He had a great birthday.
473	He takes his dinosaur everywhere.
473	It is so funny, because the button gets pushed accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.
473	We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.
473	The smog is horrible.
473	I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.
473	Neil and I have a birthday party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again.
473	She should be off of most of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.
473	We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.
473	Sammy Sosa hit a home run harder than any I've seen before.
473	Even some of the Astros fans clapped at the sheer force of it.
473	The pitcher said he watched it, just because he had never seen such an awesome hit.
473	Too bad about the heat, but what the heck can you do about it anyway?
473	Love, Kay
474	Just a reminder about tomorrow's call.
474	Enron participants, we will have a conference room on the 38th floor of EB available.
474	Kay
475	If it didn't come up when you put your cursor on it and click, then you'll have to type in the address in address space when you are on the internet.
475	Or, you can search Paige Record Southwestern University on the web and find it.
475	Hope this helps.
475	Kay
476	In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).
476	It is scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.
476	We are still in the process of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.
476	Thanks, Kay Here are the most recent comments from VEPCO: Some of you may have received this already.
476	I have not compared it against what we last sent them.
477	Please make sure Sheila has the host code.
477	thanks
478	yes
479	Sheila said her assistant arranged for one.
479	Could you check?
480	At least drinks and coffee.
480	Thanks for thinking of it.
481	Hi, my name is Kay, and I'm a Diet Coke addict.
482	Suzanne, I left the response (which is a letter from Siemens Westinghouse) on the part of my desk which is next to the window.
482	I MAY have put it in a file folder labeled "Westinghouse".
482	The letter references a letter we sent to them in the first line.
482	Please find the letter and fax to Bill.
482	Thanks a bunch.
483	It would be very helpful if you could participate, or have your designee participate.
483	Sorry for the short notice (what else is new).
483	Perhaps we can also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement.
483	I'm out this am, but will pick up voice mail.
483	Thanks, Kay PS I can't wait to hear about St. Lucia.
484	I assume that this is in lieu of the meeting we had scheduled for tomorrow afternoon?
484	Just want to make sure...
484	Kay
485	I've scheduled the conference room for 2 hours.
485	We are also looking at Friday am.
485	Is Friday better for you guys?
485	Kay
486	There's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the Westinhouse warranty issues.
486	It is tomorrow (Thurs) at 1230.
486	Do you have any interest in sitting in?
486	Kay
487	What did Heather tell you?
488	Couldn't tell if you saw this...
489	Sounds good so far.
490	This replaces the meeting scheduled for 400 tomorrow.
491	I have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule.
491	To be honest with you, I'm a bit unclear on who is doing what with this.
491	Any advice/insight?
491	Kay
492	The room is 3AC5C1, according to this email.
492	I didn't check to see what it was before.
493	CR [aka conference room] 5C1.
493	I know they are in the Allen Center.
493	I'm just damn smart, that's all.
494	You are a BIG HELP.
495	Not finished yet.
496	Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to discuss the VEPCO PPA.
496	The meeting will be held in EB38C1.
496	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
496	Kay
497	Yikes.
497	Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon tomorrow?
497	I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.
497	Otherwise, I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.
497	You pick a time (the earlier being better for me).
497	Thanks, Kay
498	Here is the latest version.
498	Our meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 300 in Kay
499	Here 'tis, and I'm a yes.
500	I'm going to visit with the Hermanator briefly tomorrow.
500	Would you like to join me?
500	Kay
501	Done!
501	See you then.
501	I've asked Heather and Jeffrey Keenan to join me.
501	Kay
502	FYI.
503	I hope to go, at least Friday/Saturday, assuming we have a sitter for Michael, of course.
503	I met Mrs. Kerekgarto yesterday.
503	Chris Duerr (duerrc@spring-branch.isd.tenet.edu/).
503	Maybe you should ask to visit which ever classroom Chris thinks Michael would be in assuming he started at VO on September 5.
503	Just a suggestion.
503	Or maybe you can visit more than one class.
503	You might want to ask to visit a class during an academic time (as opposed to when the kids are in centers).
504	Here is a rough draft of the Fehr option.
504	Herman, you will be happy to know that this one is much shorter.
504	It needs some clean up, but this should be enough to get comments going.
504	Kay
505	Just a reminder that until the finance arrangements are fixed and the rules are clear, Enron can't incur any hard costs related to the Virginia Power deal.
505	This means Enron can't obligate itself to purchase any equipment or materials, or enter into any services agreements except for studies, etc. I will try to get some clarification on what can be done at this point, and will pass it along as soon as possible.
505	Kay
506	Hi Jo, I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you a note as well.
506	Our son, Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten, which we have decided may not be most suitable for him.
506	We discussed it with Vivian Shudde, and she suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School.
506	My husband and I would like to visit Grace.
506	We are wondering if it might be possible to visit tomorrow.
506	Please let me know what you think.
506	Thanks, Kay Mann
507	Don't forget the progress report.
507	Thanks, Kay
508	Hi John, Looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before.
508	Thanks, Kay
509	yes.
510	Jo, We had some unexpected complications with scheduling today.
510	We'll have to reschedule.
510	Thanks for such a prompt reply.
510	Kay
511	He's doing great today.
511	He's here with me.
511	He just attended a meeting with Ozzier, Heather, Herman and Sheila.
512	Sounds good.
512	Early in the week is better for me.
513	Here's a suggestion for the equipment question: ENA and its affiliates have contractual rights to numerous turbines, several of which can satisfy the technical and scheduling requirements of this project, and some of which are already manufactured.
513	In the case of turbines still in the manufacturing process, ENA has firm commitments for delivery, backed by liquidated damages clauses and other financial incentives.
514	Hope this helps.
514	FYI, if you are doing the deal with EECC or NEPCO, I would just as soon them not see these docs.
515	Here are my comments to the draft response: 4.
515	I'm a bit troubled by the first sentence, since I really don't know what may have been on the drawing board earlier.
515	Maybe someone else can vouch for this statement.
515	Otherwise, I suggest deleting it.
515	17.
515	The reference to NC Power utilizing the plant should be Applicant (third sentence).
515	18.
515	I would change the second sentence to begin "It is intended that the plant will be designed, constructed and operated...."
515	Kay
516	Hi there, We've had about 15 minutes of rain, I think.
516	Just enough to keep the mosquitos happy!
516	Kay
517	That would be great.
517	Kay Mann 29 Inverness Park Way Houston 77055 Thanks, Kay
518	Hi Dina, Do we have a CA with Teska Associates?
518	Thanks, Kay
519	One more CA question.
519	Pollina Corporate Real Estate?
519	Thanks, Kay
520	I believe this draft reflects Herman's comments: Kay
521	I'll check on the geotech.
521	What is involved in the site development plan?
521	Don't give up!
521	There may be a way to get this done.
521	Kay
522	Hi Gerry, Enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position.
522	In fact, I work with reformed engineers daily, in various capacities.
522	Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go through six month rotations in various parts of the business.
522	In addition, there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.
522	If you see something that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get the inside scoop.
522	FYI, Enron North America, Enron Broadband, and Enron Energy Services are good choices.
522	ENA is the old Enron Capital & Trade, so it is the real heart of Enron (yes, it is where I now work).
522	Enron is also focusing on industrial development (paper, steel, and who knows what else).
522	I don't suggest EECC.
522	Hope to see you soon, Kay
523	I'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks (survey work, etc.).
523	I've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs until the financing/accounting treatment has come together.
523	That lead to the question of what is a hard cost.
523	I know construction/equipment obligations are problems, studies generally ok.
523	This leads me to the conclusion that a geotechnical survey would be ok.
523	Am I safe here?
523	Thanks, Kay
524	Karen, Both Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf are out of town this week, which means we don't have all the players from Global Finance available.
524	Humberto (can't remember how to spell his last name) from Global Finance/ENA may be available, and he has participated in similar discussions on two other projects.
524	At some point he will need to be involved.
524	The time is fine with me.
524	Kay
525	Hi Nancy, This should do it.
526	Hi Matt, ENA is selling some of the LM6000's to ESA.
526	Will you be the ENA Tax Man on the deal?
526	Thanks, Kay
527	Back at cha!
528	Reagan, Just to clarify, we intend to assign the land option to Rocky Mount, they buy it and lease the land to us once they own it/annex it/zone it.
528	Kay
529	Hi Gloria, Could you please print these for me?
529	Thanks, Kay
530	Just in case you haven't seen a copy, NCNG has filed a petition to intervene in the CPCN proceeding.
530	The reason stated is that it isn't clear who is providing the natural gas.
530	It has asked for the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses, to file briefs and argue its position, etc. Kay
531	Allyson, Please delete Stuart Zisman and add me to your distribution list.
531	Thanks, Kay
532	No problem.
533	I like this answer.
534	I'm going to have an updated contact list prepared.
534	Please email me with your telephone, location, email address, and cell phone number, if desired.
534	Please let me know who should be added to this list.
534	If you are receiving this vis a cc, I have your information.
534	Thanks, Kay
535	Here's two more to add.
535	I suggest you put our outside counsel last on the list.
535	There are two firms: Kilpatrick, Stockton and Bracewell & Patterson.
535	I would put Bracewell before Kilpatrick.
535	Thanks bunches.
536	Here's the current redline, incorporating most of the comments made last week.
536	Herman, the language to address your biggest issue is in 2.3, page 7 on the marked version.
536	Thanks, Kay
537	more...
538	For the Bracewell part of the list.
539	Another print job.
539	Please make me a Wheeling Pitt file folder for these docs as well.
539	Thanks, Kay
540	I'm keeping this one.
540	Too cool!
541	This should be the final (or at least almost final) version.
541	The amounts are correct.
542	FYI
543	We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily identifiable/assignable/etc.
543	Is this still the plan?
543	Kay
544	Per Ray's request...
545	FYI.
546	I'm far afield of my area of expertise, but Boyd's comments make a great deal of sense to me.
546	Gregg, did you/will you pass these along to PERC?
546	Perhaps it would help if Boyd could speak directly to the PERC person with the typewriter, so to speak.
546	Kay
547	Kevin, Thank you for your work.
547	I especially appreciate the memo bringing me Kay
548	Here's what I have...
549	Otra mas.
549	Did I get that right?
550	Hi Ben, I've started a draft of the ESA document, and I wanted to get your comments before I go much further.
550	Basically, I want to make sure I'm on the right track.
550	I'll make it look pretty as we go along.
550	Getting the deal points are most important at this point.
550	Thanks, Kay
551	Sara, Maybe a conference call with Gregg would be the most productive way to go.
551	Kay
552	Feels funny emailing someone so close.
552	I'm addicted to email, however, I saw Gregg in the elevator lobby as the door was closing.
552	I'm going to see if I can corner him while he is in town to see what is going on.
552	I'm not up-to-speed on this one.
552	Kay
553	Good morning.
553	Here is the email you mentioned.
553	Have a great day!
553	Love, Kay
554	I believe I have compared the ENA Aug 29 version to the VEPCO Aug 21 version of the Capacity and Energy Contract.
554	I'm no expert at CompareRite, but I believe it worked.
554	Here goes: Let me know if you have any trouble opening this document.
554	Kay
555	The details for today's conference call are as follows: 1:30 CDT Call in number 800 851 1766, participant code 685753 Rose is on vacation and Sheila will be calling in from Portland.
555	I have a 100 conference call, but I will step out if I can.
555	Talk to you soon!
555	Kay
556	Maybe spelling your name right will help this go through.
556	Sorry!
557	July 31st for Edgecombe.
557	I didn't prepare the other option, but I'll check to see if there is a copy around.
557	Kay
558	I'm looking at the Skelton option (Hart County, GA), and can't figure out when it was executed.
558	(must confess I didn't read EVERY word) Can anyone help me with this?
558	Thanks, Kay
559	Chris, I would think that we would want to designate which units are affected by the provisions of the change orders, to the extent a the change is specific to certain units.
559	What do you think about that approach?
559	Kay
560	I am STILL on my 100 conference call.
560	I'll catch up on what I missed later.
560	Kay
561	Glad you wrote, since I need to send you this option agreement for your review: I will chase down the fax and give it a look.
561	Thanks, Kay
562	Hi there.
562	I have a personal errand to run (nothing bad) Thursday am, so I won't be in until around lunchtime.
562	Can't WAIT to hear about your trip.
562	I hope it was marvelous.
562	We're looking at a private school for Michael (St.Francis).
562	I think it is time for a change.
562	Kay
563	I need to talk to the commercial guy on the deal.
563	Got a name for me?
563	Thanks, Kay
564	Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark Here's how I understand the deal: People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.
564	We have presented to People's a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.
564	Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.
564	The essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to $25mm, as our fee.
564	In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, legal, accounting and engineering lead.
564	Peoples and Enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.
564	We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.
564	The basic goals are: Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and covered by our confidentiality agreement.
564	Define term (5 years) Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 50/50, with prior approval.
564	In that regard an immediate concern is getting the engineering work kicked off.
564	We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.
564	We do not want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our methodology.
564	Please correct/supplement, etc. Thanks, Kay
565	I lost the email with the information regarding where to send donations in Gabrielle's honor.
565	Can you resend it to me?
565	Thanks.
566	No problem.
566	Can't wait to see what you get.
566	I may have to order some more, plus Silly Bob, and the large Klixx, and...
566	oh my gosh, I may be a
567	I'm at home this am (kid stuff) but will be in around lunch and all afternoon.
567	I'll find you.
567	Kay
568	I wanted to make sure that everyone is happy with the name Edgecombe Development CO, LLC as the project company name.
568	We are going to amend our petition for the CPCN, and I want to get the name right.
569	I am also a notary.
570	FYI
571	Hi Kay, I'm looking for CA's with Peoples.
571	I have one dated December 23, 1998.
571	Do you have anything else, especially one more current?
571	Thanks, Kay
572	Hi Cheryl, I've been asked to see what I can find out about the status of the generator for the Westinghouse 501D.
572	I've heard stories ranging from it was on the Titantic, to it was in a rain storm.
572	Can you shed any light on its status?
572	Thanks, Kay
573	Is everyone available on Friday to discuss where we are and where we are headed with the CPCN process?
573	We need to discuss whether the petition can/should be amended to allow for a broader certificate.
573	Thanks, Kay
574	I never got the email.
574	Please send it again.
575	Here's a first draft.
575	It isn't quite done, but I wanted to let you have a look at it ASAP.
575	Kay
576	For comment, etc. Thanks, Kay
577	I am absolutely delighted.
577	Kay
578	Laura, Here's a draft for your review.
578	If you find it acceptable, it should be ready to go to Peoples as a draft.
578	Please let me know if you have any comments.

585	Gregg Penman was ready, but I couldn't get David Tucker at Bracewell.
585	Did he forget?
585	Thanks, Kay
586	We had a wonderful, quiet weekend.
586	The wine was very good.
586	I drank it without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.
586	It would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.
586	How do I find out how much vacation I have?
586	I know there's a system on the intranet.
586	I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.
586	I know how difficult it can get the longer I wait.
586	Thursday I won't be in until around noon.
586	More Michael stuff.

593	I should have thought ahead.
593	Thanks!!!!!!
593	Kay
594	Is he availabe tomorrow?
594	Once you get a picture of availability (maybe you have it all ready), ask Sheila what she wants to do.
594	She may want to re-schedule for tomorrow morning.
594	Kay
595	Thanks.
595	And thanks for the drink.
596	That's it, just HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
596	Hope no one is picking on you too badly today.
596	Kay
597	Hi Ben, Hope Day 1 of your daughter's illustrious academic career went well.
597	We are hoping to meet tomorrow at 130 Central in 38C2 to discuss GE issues.
597	Sheila says you won't be here quite that soon, but it would be very helpful if you could join us once you get here.
597	Time permitting, we can discuss the ESA transaction once we are done with the GE stuff.
597	See you soon, Kay
598	We have scheduled a meeting to address the status of our discussions with GE, and develop an organized approach to some issues.

603	Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM ?Mail this article to a friend By James Covert NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday.
603	"Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation," Skilling said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the power generation business.
603	The Houston-based energy company is "absolutely not" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said.
603	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired "peaking plants," which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, Skilling said.
603	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said.
603	"The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe," Skilling said.
603	"The market there is more fractional, and that creates more opportunities for someone who's playing across the board."
603	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher per-unit rate of return, Skilling said.
603	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies.
603	"We are not interested in building base-load plants," Skilling said, referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities around the clock.
603	"Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated commodity," Skilling said.
603	"But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape of the market of that commodity."
603	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone.
603	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on any one geographic region as opposed to others.
603	"There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's possible," Skilling said.
603	"There are just too many variables to approach markets like that."

604	I'm ready for another trip to Chicago, to work on the details, the transfer pricing, the Manlove monetization, etc. Would a day next week be good?
604	It would probably be helpful if Laura had some availability as well.
604	Tuesday is bad for me, but Wednesday or Thursday looks good.
604	I'll look over the list and give you a call after lunch.
604	Kay
605	If anyone asks, I would prefer to have Gloria for our temp.
605	Thanks, Kay
606	Please hang on to this for future reference.
606	Thanks, Kay
607	Hi Gregg, It looks good for tomorrow.
607	I prefer not to schedule anything later than 300, if possible, just to give myself a chance to handle the end of the week Kay
608	Hi Bob, Does this have anything to do with the Wisconsin site you mentioned in the staff meeting?
608	Thanks, Kay
609	FYI.
609	I'm talking to Gregg on the phone now.
609	Kay
610	I saw something on the intranet which says you can check all your benefits, etc , including vacation time.
610	It called for a password.
610	Did you receive a password for yours?
610	I wonder if it is the same as the password when you submit benefits.
610	Any ideas?
611	I wasn't sure if you got a copy of this.
611	Kay
612	Laura, Here's the revised version: Here's a compared version so you will know what I did: I'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will have something to discuss.
612	I'm planning on being in Chicago on Thursday if you would like to discuss any of these matters.
612	Kay
613	Ben, Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.
613	One issue is when this transaction can close.
613	Since the equipment is owned by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the WestLB facility.
613	If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle back with Lisa.
613	A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for payment for changes, storage, etc. As far as I know, this concept hasn't been addressed with GE.
613	I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.
613	I look forward to your comments.
613	Kay
614	I'm reading it now.
615	David, Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the prior drafts.
615	I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and accept the transaction.
615	In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".
615	In (y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc] Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...; 3.3 Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the redlined section on refunds. Thanks, Kay
616	Here's what's hot, what's not: Virginia Power - don't know how hot it is.
616	We should know more on Monday.
616	Chicago - just finished commenting on the Hub Agency agreement.
616	I would like to visit there next week.
616	As you know, the Manlove monetization is still on the list.
616	Laura sent me her comments to the LOI yesterday - relatively mild, so the LOI should be going to Peoples in the near future.
616	You have the list that Gregg prepared on commercial/legal to do's, and he and I will work on those things next week.
616	LM stuff.
616	General consulting business; form 97-10 EPC for affiliate, form GE contract (drafted by AK) on the list.
616	ESA/ENA turbine sale.
616	Sent Ben a draft MOU.
616	Not a time hog.
616	Miscellaneous development stuff - land options, etc, for Fred and Rusty.
616	Not very time consuming.
616	Opps, I'm late for a meeting!
616	I can give you whatever details you need.
616	All things considered, I'm in pretty good shape.
616	Kay
617	Hi Kathleen, I will try to take this one it.
617	There is a charge for it (I think) that the department picks up.
617	By the way, have you been invited to the ENA law conference at the Woodlands?
617	We need to get you in on that one.
617	Talk to you soon.
617	Kay
618	Great idea.
618	By the way, do you know if Kathleen has been included in the law conference stuff?
618	Kay
619	Today is kind of bleak.
619	Tuesday is good should something change for you.
619	Kay
620	Thanks.
620	I suspect I'll be in the loop on this one way or the other.
620	Do you want me to send you emails so you know what's up?
620	Kay
621	Do you want to keep up with this, or pretend you never heard of Chicago?
622	Here's what I know about this deal so far.
623	Please print, place in folder (surprise, not a binder!) labeled CRRA Fuel Cell Agreements.
623	Thanks!!
624	Thank you for this info.
624	Sounds like this is getting a fair amount of attention in the region.
624	I have your name written on a piece of paper.
624	Do I owe you a call?
624	Kay
625	small green pressboard like you order for me
626	Hi Nancy, We are getting geared up to look at the interconnection agreement and work on the land lease.
626	Just thought you might want to put it on the list of fun things to do in the future.
626	Kay
627	Sorry Reagan, I just opened this email.
627	Kay
628	FYI.
628	We had a conference call this am.
628	I'll catch you up later.
628	Kay
629	I'm working on the agreement, but since it is taking longer than I had hopeI wanted to send you my understanding of the basic premise for your input.
629	I'll continue to refine/integrate this into a real document while you reviethe important stuff: Hub Services.
629	&Hub Services8 include (a) transactions entered into by MEH or the PGL HUB which are subject to Peoples' Hub FERC operating statement, and (b) all physical transactions which require the use of the Manlove or Mohammad fiel(also known as &exchange8 or &enhanced hub8 services).
629	The profit [what is profit?
629	Obviously before tax, but otherwise a GAAP standard?] from Hub Services shall be split as follows: ?
629	For transactions entered into between February 15, 2000 through September30, 2000, the profit shall be equally shared.
629	?
629	For transactions entered into from October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2001(and successive years until September 30, 2004), Peoples will receive thefirst $4 million in profit (cumulative, not annual), and will Enron receivethe next $1million in profit.
629	For any profit exceeding $5 million, Peoplesand Enron will share any on a 50/50 basis.
629	This arrangement excludes all agency fees paid to MEH.
629	These fees will beshared 50/50 from the inception.
629	All internal costs incurred in the normal course of business will be borne by the party incurring same.
629	All third party costs will be shared equally, andrequire MEH board approval.
629	PERC Peaking Agreement PERC has contracts with PGL and with NICOR contracts relating to the ethane/propane peaking facility.
629	The two existing contracts pay a total of$2million (approximate or exact) in demand charges annually.
629	Any profit exceeding $2 million in a year will be shared by Peoples and Enron on a 50/basis.
629	If either of these contracts is extended in any form other than the currentform, then Peoples and Enron share the demand charge and the profit on a 50/50 basis.
629	Other Transactions Peoples and Enron will split the profit from any transactions other than those described above on a 50/50 basis.
629	Kay
630	Just in case I forget to mention it, I need to move our SF visit to Friday am, due to travel plans.
630	Is this still ok with you?
630	Kay
631	I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.
631	Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
631	Here are the issues I see: Indemnity issues: They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
631	Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
631	What is a cognizant government?
631	Limit of liability issues: They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price.
631	They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
631	They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).
631	We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.
631	Comments?
631	Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 Central if 1100 doesn't work.
631	Is this a problem?
631	Kay They should have to
632	Hi Allyson, What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has intervened in the CPCN proceeding?
632	Is this typical?
632	Does the AG's office (or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the confidential information we file?
632	Thanks, Kay
633	Calif Pwr Woes Tuesday, September 12, 2000 08:15 AM ?Mail this article to a friend (This article was originally published Monday) WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday.
633	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.
633	"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, we will do so," Hoecker told lawmakers.
633	And if price gouging is occurring "as some have alleged," he added, "we will respond accordingly, by revoking market-based rates or otherwise."
633	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under the Federal Power Act.
633	"The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities," Hoecker testified.
633	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers "until we have a record supporting such action," he said, referring to the results of the pending staff investigation.
633	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base.
633	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago.
633	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price controls don't apply.
633	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed.
633	But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange.
633	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market volatility.
633	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the power-supply problem.
633	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.
633	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were "less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate," Hoecker noted.
633	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, "the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets," he said.
633	"Large regional markets can be made to work effectively," Hoecker told the lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.
633	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market structure.
633	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news, msgs).
633	California's market structure "placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers," Reliant's John Stout testified.
633	"San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumer's Action Network.
633	Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets.
633	"California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last," said Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president.
633	"Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market," said Edwin Guiles, Sempra's president of regulated operations.
633	"This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem," said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing.
633	"We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace," Bilbray said.

634	Can the gas company also make the same requests?
635	Hi there.
635	I changed our SF appointment to 900 on Friday.
635	We have not been successful in getting a hotel room anywhere close to where we are going.
635	There is some big fashion convention in NY, and the rooms are booked as far away as Danbury, Connecticut.
635	Wild, isn't it?
635	Heather says there is a chance that we will fly out tomorrow, spend tomorrow night in NY, then I can fly to Chicago Thursday am.
635	I still plan on flying back on Thursday pm so that I can make that 900 appointment.
635	That may mean taking the midnight flight, but what the heck.
635	I'll keep you posted.
635	Kay
636	I won't be in Friday am, as I have a 900 appointment out of the office (another school visit - I hope we are almost done).
636	I don't know my travel plans yet.
636	I may ( or may not) be leaving today.
636	If not, I will be leaving tomorrow.
636	I don't need you to make any arrangements yet.
636	Kay
637	Please note.
638	Allyson, What is the proceedure for objecting to a request (either the intervenor's or the Public Staff's)?
638	Is our position weakened in resisting an intervenor's request if we have given the same information to the Public Staff?
638	Thanks again, Kay
639	I guess you are having some kinda fun over there, hitting the forward button.
639	Actually, I appreciate the info.
640	It currently appears that I will be on the road Wednesday and Thursday.
640	Figures!
640	I am going to send you a copy of the marked up interconnection agreement, which has comments from various Enron people.
640	I thought it might help you think about which way to head.
640	I would appreciate receiving an electronic file of the IC you prepared.
640	Talk to you soon, Kay
641	Is there a time limit for lodging an objection?
642	Here's a draft.
642	More names are being added, so feel free to suggest more that we forgot/overlooked, including those external to Enron.
642	Please send the info directly to Suzanne Adams.
642	Lisa, Mitch and Chris, you will be on the next draft.
642	Sorry for the oversight this time around.
642	Thank you, Kay
643	Please add Lisa Bills, Chris Herron and Mitch Robinson.
643	You have Lisa's info on the GE list.
643	Thanks, Kay
644	This is the VEPCO contact list, as far as I know.
644	Do we have another one?
644	(opps!) This is the one Gloria did while you were on holiday in the West.
644	(Doesn't that sound good?) Kay
645	Hi Neil, Looks like I'm headed to the Big Apple today, then Chicago tomorrow, back on Thursday.
645	I'll fill you in on the details when I have them.
645	Love, Kay
646	Please add this name to the Virginia Power part of the list.
647	Please check with Mike Barnas,Kent Shoemaker (GE contact list) and Rose Engeldorf and see if they are available at either 1100 Central tomorrow or 100 Central.
647	If that works for them, please reschedule the conference call, send a confirming email to Mike, Steve Swift, Kent, Marty, Scott, Rose, Sheila (and leave her a voice mail -she is on the road), etc. Thanks!
647	Kay PS.
647	I have a 330 flight today- Heather arranged.
647	I'll let you know the details when I have them.
647	I'll travel to Chicago tomorrow, returning to Houston tomorrow at a decent hour.
648	I'm either losing my mind or my email.
648	Did you send me an email re GE?
648	I thought I saw one, but now I can't find it.
648	Is that a trick, and if so, how do I do it?
648	Could you resend it, please?
648	Thanks, Kay
649	Ben, We have a draft of the VEPCO "standard" interconnect, which has been internally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.
649	Would you like a copy?
649	Nancy Wodka (Bracewell & Patterson, DC office) is outside counsel working on it as well.
649	We have had no substantive discussions with VEPCO about this agreement at all.
649	Let me know how you want to proceed.
649	Thanks, Kay
650	Important question...
650	Where should I stay in Chicago?
650	Thanks, Kay
651	flying to NYC at 330 on CO. Don't know flight number.
651	Don't know where I'm staying in NYC.
651	WED: Fly from Newark to Chicago tomorrow at 645 pm.
651	Don't know where I'm staying in Chicago.
651	THURS: Fly from Chicago to Houston, leaving at 200pm, arriving at 428.
651	That's all I know for now.
651	Kay
652	Hey Ken, I'm so sorry.
652	I'm not trying to hide!
652	I just found out I have a 300 flight to NYC on a deal I know little about, then on to Chicago, no hotel rooms in either city but GOTTA GO, not sure of the return.
652	In short, I've been Enronized.
652	I picked up your number on a scrap of paper instead of the travel agent's number (different scrap of paper I still have not found), and when you answered I couldn't figure out who I called.
652	At least your email helped me get back to reality.
652	I apologize for the confusion, for not getting back to you, etc. Please don't read anything into it other than your glimpse into Enron.
652	My sense is I'd better not commit to anything this week, since I literally don't know whether I am coming or going.
652	Thanks, Kay
653	One of them is essential to the call.
653	If they can't change the time but 130 Central is still ok with them, then leave it as is.
653	Please leave me a voice mail of the outcome.
653	Kay
654	Laura, I'll be in your offices 1st thing Thursday morning.
654	Is that a good time foyou?
654	Kay
655	Just to complete the picture.
656	fyi.
656	No hotel in NYC yet...
657	Hi Julie, Do I have seat assignments on the last two legs?
657	Many thanks, Kay
658	Laura, Here is a draft transfer price agreement: I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a beginning point.
658	I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft.
658	We can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any additions, etc, you think are necessary.
658	I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a change.
658	My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile.
658	I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.
658	Kay
659	I'm walking into the lion's den on Thursday (a/k/a Chicago) to discuss various matters.
659	I know Laura is anxious to move forward on the Manlove deal.
659	I thought it might be really neat if we (Legal) could have a game plan for this deal, described by Laura as being "like the Bammel deal".
659	If I can get Laura to commit to a time, how about a conference call to discuss where to go with this?
659	I'm taking the long way to Chicago (via Connecticut), but will be checking voice mail, etc. Thanks, Kay
660	Hello from Chicago.
660	I'm in Enron's offices, so I can pick up email.
660	Once I figure out what is going on with the ENA Legal reorganization, I should be able to figure out who to ask about hiring needs.
660	Then we should talk about how to get John into the program.
660	Maybe EECC has too many lawyers now.
660	How ironic, considering how busy we were this time last year.
660	Things change!
660	Talk to you soon, Kay
661	Hey there.
661	I don't think I've been fishing since July.
661	Geez, it is half way through September.
661	I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).
661	A whirl wind tour.
661	I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.
661	Two weeks later the owner died.
661	We need to find a "new" dive.
661	Kay
662	I gave Ben a very preliminary draft recently, then I left town (I'm in Chicago today, NYC yesterday).
662	I want to make sure I've addressed his concerns before drafts start floating around.
662	He and I are trying to get coordinated so that we can widen the circle a bit.
662	Hope this answers your questions.
662	Kay
663	Sheila, Just want you to know that I am thinking of you as I amuse myself, waiting for my meeting to begin.
663	Kay
664	Sounds good to me.
664	Next week, that is, not St. Louis.
665	I should be in the office after 1100 on Friday.
665	Are you available?
665	Kay
666	Could you please email me the names of the officers of Enrow MW, LLC?
666	Thanks, Kay
667	You are my hero....
668	Revised draft.
668	Da Bulls toner is low, so the draft doesn't look good, and I don't know where the others print.
668	Guess I could just listen for it...
669	Let me clarify.
669	She sold the place when the city put in bike lanes because it screwed up the parking.
669	I've heard wonderful, divey things about the Roll-in.
669	A top prospect.
670	The real deal:
671	Deb, Could you please check with the state of incorporation (I believe Delaware) and the Corp Secretary's office to see if the papers have been processed in both places?
671	Thanks, Kay
672	Hi guys, Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, destined to be 97 10 compliant?
672	I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's standpoint.
672	Thanks, Kay
673	Kay
674	Scott, I'll give you what we got from FCE when we meet at 300.
674	Remind me if I forget!
674	Kay
675	For your information.
676	Hi Sheila, When you have a moment (ha ha) could I get a copy of a couple of power project risk memos?
676	Thanks, Kay
677	Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.
677	I've been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts here shortly.
677	A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.
677	Thanks, Kay
678	Today is not a good day for me to go out after work.
678	I'm planning on picking up my sweetie (Michael) from school, since I've been out of town.
678	I would vote for the Roll-in.
678	No question.
678	I would buy just to see Keffer there.
678	Kay
679	Can you tell if the documents have been filed in the state of incorporation?
679	Could you send me an email with a description of what you learned about how this done?
679	I know the procedures weren't followed.
679	Thanks, Kay
680	Is John there?
680	What do you want to do this weekend?
680	Should I thaw sausage for tonight?
681	How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?
681	I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.
681	Details to follow...
681	Thanks, Kay
682	Please see if you can get a conference room, allowing 2 hours for the meeting.
682	Thanks, Kay
683	I should mention 900am as the time!
683	Enron North America Corp.
684	Russell, I don't believe we intend to qualify in all of those states.
684	Kay
685	Please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank.
685	I will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there.
685	Hope you've had a great weekend.
685	The weather was PERFECT!!!!
685	Kay
686	Hi Reagan, Is a conference room available on 29?
686	We are having a hard time finding a meeting place.
686	Thanks, Kay
687	What could be better than a meeting on an interconnection agreement?
687	I know I need to organize another turn of the C&E agreement.
687	I'm going to give it a look and see what open issues we might have.
687	Kay PS Isn't the weather perfect?
687	I thought of our friends in VA and NC with the hurricane remnants headed their way.
687	Hope it isn't too bad.
688	If I show, it will be only to lend support to those with real input, AND to show legal department solidarity (ie, avoid later lawyer shopping).
688	Thanks for the info.
688	Kay
689	Please calendar.
689	Also, Thursday is my mom's birthday, so I need to remember to shop for her at lunch tomorrow.
689	Thanks, Kay
690	Hi Sheila, Shall we try to get the Enron groups together to discuss the approach we want to take with GE in our next phone call?
690	If so, please advise of any time you have available on Monday, and I'll get it set up.
690	Thanks, Kay
691	Just want you to know that I should be getting an EPC form to work on from EECC re 9710.
691	I didn't get to discuss this with J. Schwartzenburg on Friday, since I didn't see him for after work on Friday.
691	I opted to see Michael instead since I had been out of town.
691	I've got the form break out contract for the LM 6000's.
691	I'll get it ready for you to review re the ESA deal.
691	It will probably take me a few days to get it in shape to let it go.
691	Hope you've had a great weekend.
691	I don't think the weather could have been better.
691	Kay
692	I'm trying to avoid a two elevator ride, if possible.
692	God forbid I should take the stairs!
692	I'll let you know what he comes up with, if anything.
692	Kay
693	FYI, Reagan is a man, a developer in Ben Jacoby's group.
693	I checked the paper for an obit about Don.
693	Was there one?
693	How was his mother?
693	Are you going to Jillian's on Thursday?
693	Can't wait to see pics.
693	I'll be by soon.
693	Kay
694	Power Assets is currently Sheila's group, pre-reorg.
695	Long conference calls make me happy about having email.
695	Do you want Brian/Lisa/anyone else commercial?
695	Kay
696	How about meeting in advance of tomorrow's 130 phone call to discuss the approach we want to take with GE?
696	I'm suggesting 400 this afternoon.
696	Please let me know how this works for you.
696	Thanks, Kay
697	I should have included you also.
697	Are you available?
697	Thanks, Kay
698	Lisa, I inadvertently left you off the list.
698	Hope you can come.
698	Kay
699	Lisa Bills and Brian Barto are also invited.
699	I haven't heard from anyone yet.
699	Please call the list around 200 to see if people are available.
699	Also, can you find a conference room?
699	Thanks, Kay
700	Hi Karen, I'm looking at a version which was faxed on Sept 13.
700	If this the final version?
700	Expecting the answer to be "yes", I am reviewing it now.
700	Kay
701	I suppose a location would help!
701	Location TBD, I'll make sure you get a call.
701	Kay Enron North America Corp.
702	I can come!
703	I'm looking at it right now.
703	Could you please email it to me?
703	Thanks, Kay
704	My understanding is that Illinois is the only one, unless enovate will have employees or inventory in any other states.
704	It is my understanding that it will not.
704	Gregg, Russell, Matt, please speak up if I'm missing something.
704	Kay
705	I'm going to work really hard this week to see if I can catch up a bit, and take a day off soon.
706	No surprises with CW.
706	She's very nice to me, but she does like to keep very specific hours.
706	I get the impression that leaving 15 minutes past 5 really bothers her.
706	Just watch, and see.
707	Karen, I don't run across many people without email these days.
707	Big hassle.
707	It is so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy.
707	I'm looking for the Fehr option, but the latest I have on my computer is the version I emailed to you on August 30th.
707	Is there a more up-to-date version, and if so, could you please mail it to me?
707	Thanks, Kay
708	This makes me crazy.
708	I ask her to send me a document, and she copies TWO partners on the transmittal, plus Fred and Rusty.
709	Good.
709	I feel better.
709	I just don't think we owe them enough yet.
710	It is mainly a tax issue (whether we have to pay franchise tax), and ENA Tax says we don't need to register.
710	At least that's how I understood it.
710	I'll double check.
710	We can do the name change and register later.
710	That's no problem.
710	Kay
711	Here are my observations: I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.
711	Second, there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point.
711	If we want to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter what.
711	In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.
711	We'll need to run this back through Accounting.
711	I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5.
711	If we add the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.
711	I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this parcel.
711	Kay
712	Due to a last minute conflict, we need to reschedule this meeting.
712	How does everybody look for Wednesday?
712	Sorry for any inconvenience.
712	Kay
713	Karen, Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects Rusty's suggestion.
713	Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.
713	Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to meet their request.
713	Thank you, Kay
714	Viola
715	As soon as I get a redline, I'll get it to Accounting and we can go forward quickly.
715	I will also process the Virgil and Joan Ledford deal at the same time.
715	I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow, which will help.
715	Kay
716	Sorry for the inconvenience.
716	Ozzie had to leave town, and he wanted to participate in the first meeting.
716	I'm sure we will get something worked out.
716	Kay
717	Allyson, Here is a very recent version of the PPA: Kay
718	Hi Sara, I believe we still have an interest in using an Enron form as a go by for the Enron/Peoples activities.
718	If you can give me what you are comfortable with, I will make sure it is transmitted with the appropriate caveats, confidentiality restrictions, etc. Thanks, Kay
719	Here tis.
719	We'll be turning a new draft to Peoples today or tomorrow, but I figure it needs to go to Allyson now.
719	Kay
720	Hi Cle, We need a revolving loan agreement between Midwest (now enovate) and Enron.
720	Please call me at your convenience to discuss (713 345 7566).
720	Thanks, Kay
721	Hi there, Any luck with the form to work with on the affilate/epc/97 10 compliant contract?
721	Thanks, Kay
722	Hi Allyson, Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public information.
722	Is the petition itself public?
722	What else would be public?
722	I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question.
722	Once again, your assistance is appreciated.
722	Kay
723	Hi Kay, I hate to admit this, but I need another copy of whatever confidentiality agreement we have with Virginia Power.
723	Thanks again, Kay
724	This may be our best bet.
725	This information is helpful.
725	Is the draft of the PPA submitted by VEPCO confidential?
725	Thanks, Kay
726	Hi Heather, The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows: Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the status thereof.
726	We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss amending this agreement.
726	Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.
726	Kay
727	One more thing.
727	Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?
727	Those have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.
727	Therefore, please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.
727	I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were submitting as confidential information, specifically including the responses to the Public Staff's data requests.
727	I don't recall the specifics at this point.
727	Thanks again, Kay
728	I don't know what I have in mind.
728	Austin?
728	Palacios?
728	I'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a holiday, we have to include your mom, or vice versa.
728	That just wasn't how it worked in our family growing up - we typically spent holidays with one or the other, rarely with both.
728	I'm trying to figure out the rules.
728	I haven't heard from St Francis yet.
728	Kay
729	This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv company.
729	I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the entire thing yet.
729	I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.
729	As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.
729	Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate guaranty issue?
729	I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.
729	Thanks, Kay
730	I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.
730	In short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our forms allow this.
730	I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors" whenever I can (instead of just lenders).
730	Does someone have a more artful or effective solution?
730	Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the issue.
730	Kay
731	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth.
731	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for bandwidth trading and broadband services.
731	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy.
731	Enron is still basically "an energy and broadband company," he said.
731	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth trading.
731	A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses.
731	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, Lay said.
731	It will spend more during that time if necessary.
731	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's standards.
731	Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said.
731	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area.
731	El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth trades this year.
731	Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news, msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made.
731	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a telecommunications network.
731	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year, Lay said.
731	Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later.
731	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London.
731	Enron's current plans call for a total of 13 pooling points.
731	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, facilitating bandwidth trading.
731	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom carriers.
731	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company handed out at the conference.

732	Hi Guys, I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine contracts.
732	Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to Allyson?
732	Thanks, Kay
733	Gregg, Sheila was telling me that Enron has an ISDA agreement with Peoples, and there's some guaranty language there, also.
733	I'll try to track this down.
733	Kay ps I've asked Sara for the ISDA agreement.
733	I'll let you know when I get it.
734	My fax number is 63491.
734	FYI, I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality provisions of those contracts.
734	In fact, I would like to get a copy of the 501 D contract (I have the GE contract).
734	Do you have a copy of the entire thing?
734	Thanks, Kay
735	So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?
735	Maybe we can track down the rest.
735	I have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may not be the correct one since the delivery date is last June.
735	I think ENA needs a complete copy of the contract, including any executed change orders.
735	Do you think someone in your group might have that?
735	Many thanks, Kay
736	I think it would be a good idea.
736	We really need the ENTIRE executed contract, with change orders (opps, said that already), and I only have an electronic copy.
737	No good deed goes unpunished.
738	Hi Karen, Our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 100, so it would be helpful to get this information as soon as possible.
738	It would also help if you could send a redline against the version I had sent you, as this was the last draft reviewed by Accounting.
738	Thanks, Kay
739	Nancy, I knew you were thinking about it, so I didn't worry.
739	I'm monkeying around the PPA, only because I had a meeting with Ozzie and Heather late last night.
739	Will you be picking up emails in the next day or so?
739	I can forward you what I've done for your review.
739	We need to get a Enron/BP dialogue going concerning the lease with the City of Rocky Mount.
739	When do you want to discuss this (or have us discuss it with the right B & P person)?
739	Thanks, Kay
740	Speaking of options....
741	I don't think I saw that happen.
742	I need to set up a conference call with the outside lawyer who will be drafting the lease (and other docs).
742	Who would like to participate in the call?
742	How about Thursday am?
742	Thanks, Kay
743	viola
744	Thank you for your response.
744	It is always refreshing to get good news!
745	I'm at home this am trying to get it finished up.
745	I just couldn't get 15 clear minutes at the office.
746	Here are my comments: Revise "whereas" clauses to make it an option for an easement, not a current grant of an easement.
746	Should we be able to enter all of Parcel 2 for due diligence, as opposed to just the easement area?
746	(paragraph 7) Matt, I wanted you to be aware of paragraph 17.
746	Kay
747	I'm at home this am, working.
748	What do you think of this?
748	(sorry it isn't redlined yet) (b) Intra-Day Scheduling.
748	Buyer may, upon at least four (4) Hours minimumadvance notice to Seller, request changes to a Schedule by way of an Intra-Day Schedule Notice.
748	Any such changes shall be in increments of at least 50 MW and may not exceed the Contract Capacity nor reduce the Schedulto less than four (4) Hours.

748	Seller shall use commercially reasonabefforts to provide Buyer with a price to accommodate Buyer,s Intra-DaySchedule Notice.
748	Such price shall include lost profit from any transactionwhich would be cancelled in order to accommodate Buyer,s Intra-Day SchedNotice, plus all additional costs (whether direct or indirect); provided,however, that such costs shall be limited to costs actually incurred by Seller (including cost of cover, penalties, liquidated damages, cancellatiocharges or the like due to another Person) with respect to (i) transactionsentered into by Seller with other Persons prior to receipt of Buyer,s Intra-Day Schedule Notice (provided that such transactions and the terms thereof can be verified in an audit to be performed in accordance with Section 8.3, (ii) transactions that must be entered into by Seller in orderto accommodate Buyer,s Intra-Day Schedule Notice or (iii) extra costs incurred in operating the Facility to accommodate such notice.

749	I called in for the Finance meeting.
749	I'm trying to finish up an important document and could never get a half hour without interruption.
749	I should be in after lunch.
749	Kay
750	I've returned the Staff's phone call, but got voice mail.
750	It would be helpful to discuss this before I talk to them.
750	Could we schedule something around noon (or later)?
750	Thanks, Kay
751	Now you know why I'm at home.
752	I just checked my messages.
752	Nothing from SF yet.
753	Maybe we give it a couple of hours.
753	I'm getting nervous, but I tell myself that whatever works out will be for the best.
754	No problem.
754	I got some comments from Accounting, but I'm fine if you want it to go out with the caveat that Enron has a couple of minor administrative points to clear up.
754	Kay
755	I know I'm repeating myself...thank you, thank you, thank you....
756	I'm working as fast as I can.
756	Things connect together, so it takes a little while.
756	I think I'm about done with the hard stuff.
757	I still have to fix the liquidated damages/termination stuff, but here's a redline for you to look at.
757	I picked up the comments from others (Terry, Christi) and these should be lined as well.
757	I should be done soon.
758	I'm losing it.
758	GLAD YOU LOOKED!!!
759	I need to provide the NCPUC a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as I can.
759	How long will it take?
759	Kay
760	I spoke with Bob Henson.
760	His questions were: ownership of LLC (I'm getting the documents) and status of PPA.
760	Kay
761	Yikes.
761	I think I'd still rather be a woman, although now I can't remember why I feel that way.
762	Got anything?
762	Should have been signed this year.
762	Thanks, Kay
763	I think the LLC agreement would be a big help.
763	Thanks!
764	Yes, and please add me, too.
764	I can't remember if I mentioned that before.
765	This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St. Francis, which may be his new school (so far, so good).
765	I'll be in around1000 Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, which means leaving by 445 or so.
765	October 4, ENA orientation in the am.
765	October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school (leave at 430) October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.
765	Neil has a meeting in San Antonio (usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year).
765	It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.
765	This means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing.
765	Figures, of course.
765	Thanks for asking.
765	I'm watching for some good vacation days, also...
766	We are staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, which is nice.
766	There will be a private party as SeaWorld, which could be fun.
766	They usually do everything first class all the way, since it is the officers shindig.
766	I get to see some nice people I only see once a year.
766	Everyone parties hard, too.
766	Diet time!
766	I've done ok so far, considering the travel.
766	This means I've lost the weight I gained when I was on the road every week.
767	I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI: We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.
767	Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?
767	Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?
767	I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.
767	Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?
767	I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet).
767	If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me.
767	Thanks, Kay
768	Forget the ONE or more contract questions.
768	I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project.
768	Enron North America Corp.
769	On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed.
769	Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed?
769	Thanks, Kay
770	Remarkably clear explanation.
771	Here's a draft letter for CRRA.
771	I didn't send it to Jeff since he is out today.
771	Kay
772	Hi Cle, FYI.
772	Kay
773	I think you and I may have different documents.
773	Maybe we should compare.
773	Thanks, Kay
774	What time?
775	FYI.
775	Meeting is at 100
776	Per your request.
777	FYI, no action requested at this time.
778	Being first is overrated.
778	IS IT TIME YET???
779	Allyson, You should receive some formation documents relating to Edgecombe Development.
779	The name is not spelled correctly (missing an "e"), but that is being corrected at this time.
779	Bob spoke to me about wanting Enron to send a letter concerning the financing arrangements for the project.
779	I would like for us to discuss this as well.
779	Kay
780	This is a comparison to their version.
780	I think I have a comparison to ours as well.
780	Kay
781	A comparison to ours.
781	Kay
782	Hi Gregg, I was out of the office on Friday, so I just now heard your voice mail.
782	I haven't been through all my email, but I haven't seen anything from Stephanie on email.
782	I do have a hard copy version which is too long to fax with confidence.
782	I'll give the forms a look, and fax them your way with some type of disclaimer for Peoples benefit.
782	Kay
783	I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit, mostly regulatory- they are so so.
783	It is my understanding that the Atlanta office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them.
783	I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office (multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results.
783	I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up with the right folks in Atlanta.
783	Kay
784	Okey dokey.
785	Wanna go?
785	Sounds like fun to me.
785	Michael will love it.
785	Kay
786	Sounds good to me.
786	I'll check with Neil.
786	I know Michael would love it.
786	Thanks, Kay
787	Hi John, Question.
787	Can we agree that a form contract will work for both EECC and NEPCO?
787	Sure would make life easier.
787	Kay
788	Pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.
788	Perhaps the sky is not falling.
789	Gentlemen, I've recently become involved in the "cell sale" side, meaning the transaction to sell the Fuel Cell equipment cells to CRRA.
789	I've met the Fuel Cell folks, but have not met anyone with CRRA yet.
789	Currently, I'm preparing a letter of intent for Enron/CRRA for the purchase/sale of the cells, have a development agreement prepared by outside counsel to review, and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for FCE to review.
789	I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he cares to read.
789	I've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase the equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase), but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.
789	I would like to chase down that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded, however.
789	I'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol, as I know Dave is very interested in that aspect of the process.
789	Kay
790	Per your request.
790	Kay
791	This is an internal draft, which has not been sent to CRRA, as far as I know.
791	Kay
792	Here's my suggestion: 27.3 Consequential Losses.
792	The Parties have agreed to liquidate certaindirect damages and have provided for these damages as Liquidated Damages anCancellation Fees.
792	For purposes of this Section, Liquidated Damages and Cancellation Fees shall not be deemed consequential losses.
792	In no event,whether as a result of breach of contract, breach of warranty, indemnity,tort liability (including negligence or strict liability without regard tofault) or otherwise, and whether arising before or after completion of theScope of Work, shall either Party be liable to the other Party for special,indirect, exemplary or consequential losses of any nature whatsoever, including losses or damages caused by reason of unavailability of the Equipment, shutdowns or service interruptions, loss of use, loss of profitsor revenue, inventory or use charges, cost of purchased or replacement poweinterest charges or cost of capital or claims of a Party,s customers.
792	For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing limitation of liability in this Section shall in no case not limit Seller,s obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser Indemnified Parties in accordance with Article XX for anclaims Third Party Claim, including Claims involving the Third Party's consequential losses, losses or damages occasioned by third parties.
792	in accordance with Article XX,
793	I have in mind a contract that EECC and NEPCO will agree is the ENA form contract, so that there isn't a need to come up with two different contract forms.
793	Is that too high of a mountain to climb?
794	I hope this didn't sound flippant, cuz I didn't mean it that way.
794	Kay
795	This is the one you looked at and left me comments.
795	Your comments aren't in this draft (timing), but I want to pick them up in the next go round.
795	When we get together to discuss stuff, maybe we can review this.
795	It is difficult to get your comments over voice mail, as I'm just not that quick!
795	Kay
796	Karen, Could we have the option of using a letter of credit versus a corporate guaranty?
796	(8)
797	Matt, Since so much of this related to tax, I thought you should have a look at it.
797	Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the information.
797	Is this something which is going to the public, or to the governmental entity involved?
797	If there is something which will be distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group bless it.
797	Kay
798	Hmm.
799	Hi Dan, One more thing I want to mention.
799	As you know, Enron has a confidentiality agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).
799	The agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company from chasing certain transactions without Enron.
799	Once we really know what we are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?
799	FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.
799	I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.
799	Kay
800	You made me laugh.
801	How about meeting in Sheila's office (3879) at 1030?
802	Hi Stephanie, Thanks for the hard copy of the ISDA docs.
802	Would it be possible to get an electronic version of what you gave me?
802	Thanks again, Kay
803	I received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the LOC.
803	The reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing structures, depending on which entities own equity in the LLC at the time of the posting of the security.
803	Perhaps language such as "an appropriate payment security" or other similar language can be utilized.
803	Please be assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a corporate guaranty.
803	The draft responses have been forwarded to the Enron tax department, due to the discussions concerning certain tax issues.
803	I believe it is appropriate to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released.
803	Also, I don't believe I fully appreciate the context of these questions and answers, and how and to whom these answers will be given.
803	A brief explanation would be most appreciated.
803	Thank you, Kay
804	Here's the latest info I have.
805	Other than that Mrs. Lincoln...
806	I thought it was an excellent synopsis.
807	Has anyone given any thought to the creation of a new company to enter into the CRRA/Fuel Cell purchase/sale transactions?
807	Any names to suggest?
807	If Enron is going to be the contractor as contemplated by the PDA, I would expect to use a limited liablity company and not ENA.
807	Please advise.
807	Kay
808	I can call you when I get out of my meeting, but it might be awhile.
808	Or, it might be 600.
808	Dunno.
809	FYI.
809	I'll bring you the ONSI confidentiality agreement.
810	Got anything that looks like a confidentiality agreement with a company called ONSI?
810	Should have been signed this spring.
810	Thanks.
810	Kay
811	Hi Sarah, Thank you so much for your efforts to get this scheduled.
811	However, it doesn't look today is going to work.
811	Since spoke earlier this week, Michael has been accepted to private school, where we believe we will move him.
811	However, we still haven't determined what to do about speech therapy, and would appreciate the benefit of your evaluation and expertise, especially since Michael is eligible to receive services at VO.
811	Is it possible to schedule a meeting with that in mind?
811	Thanks again, Kay
812	FYI, and for us to discuss.
813	Just a reminder that the Enron team is planning to meet a half hour before the call (330).
813	Kay
814	In connection with the attached, please note the highlighted language at the end of the document.
814	We couldn't decide what it means, so it needs to be re-written or deleted.
814	The party we are contracting with is Virginia Power, not NC Power.
814	If we misstated this previously, we would like to clear it up now.
814	Thank you, Kay Mann
815	Karen, It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to Enron: risk of damage to a certain road during construction.
815	It would seem that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a result of the construction.
815	Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill.
815	What is the intent?
815	Thank you, Kay
816	Here are my observations: I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.
816	I agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk for a performance problem.
816	Is the reference to the "State" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?
816	As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.
816	Kay
817	I'm good anytime after 900 am on Monday.
817	Kay
818	Here's a marked version of suggested changes.
818	Would it be preferable to be consistent with the use of the names VEPCO and Capacity and Energy Agreement?
818	Kay
819	Good afternoon, Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I wanted to introduce myself.
819	I hope we will get to meet in person soon.
819	Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition easier?
819	I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight.
819	l won't ask any questions until I do my homework.
819	I look forward to seeing you soon!
819	Kay
820	1.
820	I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.
820	I asked around yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.
820	Initially going through Corp (vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.
820	2.
820	I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.
820	I think that the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an exhibit.
820	I will resend the email for your easy reference.
820	Hope this helps.
820	Kay
821	Hi Heather, Don't have the answers to your questions, but I wanted you to see the attachment to Gregg's email.
821	It outlines some of the commercial aspects of the loan agreement, although it might not be in a form you can easily decipher.
821	Kay
822	So do we now have an Enovate/enovate?
822	Thanks, Kay
823	I had the definite impression he was going to call you.
823	I also know he is working on a different deal on an impossible schedule.
823	You know the drill.
823	Bart is a Washington & Lee guy.
823	He is older than Ned, so he didn't go to school with him.
823	Just a little trivia...
823	Kay
824	Sounds like progress.
825	No response required - fyi.
826	Heather, This is a rough cut of a services agreement.
826	Since the loan agreement, services agreement and LLC agreement are all pieces of the same puzzle, I thought I would send it your way.
826	Kay
827	Hi Fred, I will check with Herman again to get his final comments.
827	Kay
828	Can Legal be far behind?
829	I'm headed to a lengthy conference call, but I wanted you to have this info.
829	Anything going on with Manlove?
829	Kay
830	FYI.
830	I don't think it will take long to get a draft.
830	I'm happy to coordinate with Sarah and Accounting.
830	Is it Mary Lynn that I should talk to?
830	Kay
831	I have not dropped it off yet.
831	Can he be set up for Monday?
832	FYI.
833	I working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.
833	She (outside counsel, Heather Brown) has summarized the information I have given her as follows (see below), and I would appreciate your input as to whether it is accurate.
833	Once we get a draft we can sit down and discuss it, and make sure we are on the right track.
833	I believe Gregg said that this needs to be in place within 2 weeks.
833	Thanks, Kay Thanks for the information.
833	If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an "autoborrow" facility ...
833	Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account.
833	Each day: (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.
833	We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people.
833	Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache).
833	Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.
834	How could I resist such an opportunity?
834	Enron North America Corp.
835	With a typical contractor a tight schedule usually increases the cost.
835	You might check to see how much a delay in COD to, say Aug 1, might lower the cost of construction.
835	Not to say that it will, but it might.
836	BUSY, as usual.
836	Kay
837	I thought Tom wanted to change the time.
837	Did he get with you on that?
838	Hi Heather, Any idea what the analyst starting salary might be?
838	If not, can you point me in the right direction?
838	I know you don't have anything better to do, but I really appreciate it.
838	Kay
839	Heather, Just go to your DASH form file and pull out language from another deal just like this one.
839	That's how we handle things on the 38th floor.
839	Kay
840	A more lucid explanation of the issues.
841	Lee, Can you see me a Word (or WordPerfect) file for this letter?
841	Thanks, Kay
842	Gentlemen, I haven't seen the 501D contract yet.
842	Is it on its way or perhaps been misdirected?
842	Thanks, Kay
843	Hi Paul, I've been reviewing the draft facilities agreement, which is now getting to be a hot topic.
843	One thing to keep in mind is that we would really prefer that the facility agreements not refer to the May 12 agreement, if this is possible.
843	Could you please give this some thought and review the document with this in mind?
843	I look forward to discussing this with you soon.
843	Thanks, Kay
844	Hi Paul, This will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the GE contract we are working on.
844	Thanks, Kay
845	3841 is my office number.
846	I've made a stab at revising Lee's letter.
847	Heather, I haven't heard back from anyone on the single lender issue, but I say go for it, assuming a single lender deal.
847	At least that gives us something to work with.
847	Thanks, Kay
848	Allyson, Here's a suggestion on the language to address the issue of termination "for any reason".
848	On page 3, line 18, insert after "limits", deleting the remainder of the sentence: Applicant's requirement to notify the Commission to instances where the Agreement is terminated as a result of Applicant's default.
848	Thanks, Kay
849	Are we good to go?
849	I forgot to show my husband your pictures.
849	If it is ok with you, I'll bring them back on Monday.
849	Have a great weekend, Kay
850	For those who don't have these numbers, here we go: I have Ozzie and Heather's contact numbers as well, but don't see any reason to take up their time unless something commercial arises.
850	Jeff, I'll be glad to hold you numbers in trust as well.
850	I have nothing special planned (there goes my wild image), so I'm available anytime.
850	I'm going to read over the latest versions, keeping in mind that the commercial deal is done.
850	Kay
851	Good luck, and fire (release, shoot, fling) straight!
851	Kay
852	It took place.
852	We made some progress in indemnity and LOL.
852	The carve outs from the LOL remain an open issue.
852	We had some helpful discussion about assignment, but I'm not sure how much progress was made.
852	You were assigned NO tasks this week!
852	Kay
853	Stuart has finished his review of the PR invoices, and not the massive pile is on my desk.
854	Here's the VEPCO version.
855	Much grass.
856	Please start me a Fuel Cell notebook, beginning with the clean versions of the documents listed below (don't need the redline).
856	The binder needs to be at least a 2 inch binder.
856	Thanks, Kay
857	Scott has given me some comments on the LOI, which I hope to discuss and incorporate today.
857	Does anyone else have any comments?
857	Thanks, Kay
858	Hi there.
858	I made changes in accordance with our meeting on Friday.
858	Please let me know what other changes you would like to see.
858	Thanks, Kay
859	Yes.
860	I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.
860	Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a certain specification.
860	I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.
860	I'm referring to these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the warranties apply.
860	Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the units utilizing these stacks?
860	Kay
861	Always!
862	FYI
863	I thought someone from Trading should give this a look.
863	Thanks, Kay
864	I'm out October 9 and 27.
865	I'm trying to pick a favorite.
866	Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.
866	I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.
866	However, I wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all the way down the line.
866	This is a very tall order given the contracting environment.
866	Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.
866	Kay
867	I'm just afraid to say anything about anything because of what you said the other night about, gee you can't do anything right.
867	I guess I'm a little upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold clothes, pack the car, unpack the groceries, load the dishwasher, etc.) but if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you can't do anything right (so I should feel guilty about saying anything about anything).
867	Gotta go.
867	We can talk about it later if you want.
867	Love, Kay
868	Here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers.
868	Is it ready to go to GE?
868	Scott, payment for change orders is addressed in the contract.
869	I would think cocktail attire.
869	What time are the receptions?
870	Just a small piece of internal discussions regarding the revolving line of credit and how it ties in with the enovate bank account.
871	Roxanne, Thank you for calling last night.
871	We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate his first day at SF, and missed your call.
871	Michael had a great first day.
871	All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.
871	I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.
871	We live on Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.
871	It is nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.
871	Again, thanks for calling.
871	Kay
872	Tough time of day to dress for, but I think you have it figured out.
873	I don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now - I've gained weight in the past 18 months.
873	I may do a little shopping.
874	Hi Scott, Here's a revised draft for your review and comment.
874	I've taken out the balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing what BOP entails.
874	So now it is just a warranty.
874	I've also been more explicit about our fee.
874	I think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the uncertainty about who is doing what, but I haven't come up with a simple fix yet.
875	Sorry, didn't mean to forget you.
876	That's a good one.
877	I knew you guys would hit a home run!
877	I have a conference call at 330, then I'll come see you.
877	Kay
878	Please print for me.
878	Thanks, Kay
879	More to go with that other print job.
880	Warning: I have not even opened this to see how it looks.
880	The goal is to delete the reference to WestLB and the master agreement, so I know there is work to be done along those lines.
880	At least this is a start.
880	Kay
881	This is for the PSCO project, and Ben wants Chris to sign it.
881	I'm thinking that this is Dale's project, so I'm sending him a copy.
881	If it looks ok to you I will clean it up and send it to GE for their review.
881	Kay
882	Maybe I'll get your address right this time.
883	Jerry, Thanks.
883	I'll give it a look immediately, and will discuss the game plan with Heather.
883	Congratulations on wrapping up the alliance and associated agreements.
883	Looks like an interesting and exciting opportunity for both companies.
883	Kay
884	Kent, Here's a revised change order #2.
884	Please let me know if you have any comments: Thanks, Kay
885	Kent, Here's a revised letter agreement.
885	It is being reviewed internally, but I wanted to get it to you today anyway, as I will be out of the office beginning tomorrow around 1100.
885	Kay
886	FYI, I am attaching the current term sheet for the Rio Gen EPC contract which is has been approved by AA and I believe Global Finance.
886	Kay
887	Here is the current rev of the EECC "standard" form which I am reviewing/massaging in connection with the 97 10 exercise.
887	It includes the exhibits, where I think you can find something useful.
887	If this doesn't help, please let me know and I will check elsewhere.
887	Thanks, Kay
888	Mark, I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special Use for Livingston Energy Center.
888	Is Titan Land Development the Owner?
888	Will it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the relevant land options and the commencement of construction?
888	I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.
888	Kay
889	Please order me a 3 hole punch and more letter size red ropes.
889	Thanks!!
889	Kay
890	The water could be 100 feet or more away from the dock, depending on how long it blows that hard.
890	I hope our shrimp come back.
891	There's a rumor going around that you are signing up people for the pilotprogram.
891	If true, I would love to volunteer, as I work at home frequently.
891	Thanks, Kay
892	Gregg, It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use.
892	Peoples has forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.
892	Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting point for discussions.
892	Since these are forms, there will certainly be aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and Enron.
892	These documents should be treated as confidential.
892	Kay
893	Hi Ben, Janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for development documents.
893	How do you want you name to read on the corporate documents?
893	Thanks, Kay
894	I volunteered to be a guinea pig.
895	I've already discussed this with Mark H. and he thought it had already been done.
895	I haven't found any indication that it has been done.
895	I'll follow up immediately.
895	Kay
896	Deb, I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea.
896	I'll have to check on the expense account stuff.
896	Kathleen, you haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?
896	Could you get the names of the active development companies so that we can address those, as well as ENA?
896	Thanks, Kay
897	Lisa, I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an offsite, so I might have missed something.
897	I'll get you a copy of CO #1.
897	CO #2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.
897	I'll have to confirm the status of the MOU and CO#3/#4.
897	These have bounced around a bit, so I need to nail it down so I don't give you bad information.
897	Kay Enron North America Corp.
898	Not this week.
898	Maybe next week.
899	Hi.
899	Just checking in. Michael and I are having a nice morning.
899	I've got my computer plugged in to my home line, but my cell phone is on.
899	Michael has an appointment at 230, so I will be out of a while.
899	This is great stay home weather.
899	I have fires in the fireplaces.
899	All I'm missing is the smell of bread baking!
899	Kay
900	I thought the conference was pretty good.
900	I had a great room, with a HUGE jacuzzi tub.
900	Did anyone get promoted?
900	No one said anything about promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.
900	I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got out some clothes to give to the maid.
900	It all feels good.
900	I'm going to do email now.
900	See you tomorrow!
900	Kay
901	Make that cleaned out my purse, not my person.
901	Geez.
902	I'm not at the office today, but I probably have a copy of the Option.
902	I don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase.
902	Do you have a copy of it to see if it gets my memory working?
903	okey dokey
904	Please print and put in the Fuel Cell binder you made me last week.
904	It is on my desk, I think.
905	Everything went fine.
905	I hope Dan is ok.
905	Did the antibiotics not work?
905	I know he has been worried, but I thought he was feeling better.
905	Now I'm worried.
905	How old would you mother have been today?
905	I was wondering about Karen.
905	I wasn't sure what her title was before.
905	I haven't checked voice mail yet.
905	Heather called on my cell phone, which was fine.
905	I hear the Mark (NYC) is VERY nice.
905	I hope to get back earlier than 600 on Friday, but not early enough to come in. I'll figure it out tomorrow.
905	Ciao, Kay
906	Congratulations!!!!
906	You should be proud.
906	I am!
907	I suspect that it wasn't recorded.
907	My bad.
908	Hi Guys, Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.
908	In the future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to the process.
908	Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?
908	Thank you, Kay
909	I found the originals, so please disregard my question about same.
910	How's you dad?
910	I hope everything went well.
910	Did you make it in time to see him before the surgery?
910	Kay
911	I believe this to be the latest draft of the PSCO change order.
911	Kay
912	I didn't know there were 5 things to get clogged.
912	What a blessing that he had the surgery before he had a heart attack.
912	Somehow I'm not surprised that your dad is a quick healer.
912	Still, going home today is amazing.
912	Kay
913	You know how I hate to have originals.
913	Please take them from me!!!!!
914	Once I get the draft I will set up a conference call with the people who can provide the input on the document.
914	If it would be better to have the call before let me know, and I will try to set it up.
914	I'm free tomorrow am if that is a good time for you.
915	I have the September 13th invoice.
915	Could you fax me the rest?
915	Thanks, Kay PS.
915	I feel like I had previously approved at least one of these invoices.
915	We have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel, so just about anything is possible.
916	FYI.
916	I've discussed this with Mark and he didn't have any problem with it.
916	Kay
917	I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.
917	I've talked to Deb Korkmas about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal with as many as possible at once.
917	As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name to the reports.
917	ANy other ideas?
917	Kay
918	I was wondering if you were there.
918	Hope the weather is better there than in Houston.
918	Is there any water in the bay?
918	Love, Kay
919	FYI.
920	Attached is the most recent draft I have of the change order for the ESA stuff.
920	I think we need to add the info on drawing numbers and delivery dates for the options, much like we did on change order #2.
920	Please let me know what you think.
920	Kay
921	It will escalate over time.
921	That's how it worked for me.
922	This is more like it.
922	If my flight is on time, I should be able to pick up Michael.
922	Kay
923	opps I read it wrong.
923	Darn.
924	I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow afternoon, through the remainder of the week.
924	I'm assisting with the negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.
924	This is a Jeff Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep you informed.
924	Kay
925	Kathleen, Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you raised.
925	October 2 sounds good to me for an effective date, but you might as well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.
925	Good job.
925	Thanks, Kay
926	Anything to get ONE thing off the "to do" list....
927	This was sent to me by one of the developers.
927	I believe it relates to an expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.
927	I don't know which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if anyone claims it.
927	Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been working on it.
927	Kay
928	Deb, Let's go ahead with POA's for Ben F. Jacoby for ENA, Tarheel Land Development, Edgecombe Development, and Titan Land Development in accordance with Janet's request and ENA standard practice.
928	Deb, I have the impression that this is something you typically handle, although I'm glad to volunteer Kathleen for the task if that would help.
928	There will be other companies, but we can add these as we go.
928	Kathleen, please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time.
928	For instance, what are the names of the Florida development companies?
928	Your assistance is greatly appreciated, as Janet is eager to get this done.
928	Thanks, Kay
929	Well, I personally would like your input, although I'm not clear who will end up with it.
929	Kay
930	We can always do the POA's after the fact, if necessary.
930	There are something like 45 development companies, so I hate to do them all at once.
930	I would at least ask Ben to identify key regions.
930	However, you do need the names of the companies anyway, because they are mostly your companies!
931	Please call Mike and Kent directly.
931	Thanks.
932	Found it.
932	It was buried beneath a stack.
932	Looks good.
932	I would add something to the effect that the appointment terminates if Ben leaves the company's employment.
932	Thanks,
933	I'm glad you mentioned that fact.
933	I'll keep you advised of anything I come across that relates to a peaker.
933	Speaking of which, are you generally aware of a warranty claim against Westinghouse for the Gleason project?
933	I've been helping Mitch out here and there on it.
933	Kay
934	Kathleen, Please proceed as outlined.
934	Kay
935	Ed, Would it be possible to designate which is East/West, as opposed to just deleting the West entities?
935	That way, us Easterners will know when we are encountering a Western entity.
935	Thanks, Kay
936	Good thing those offices are big up there.
936	Must be getting crowded.
937	I've never heard of them.
938	When do you leave next week?
938	Kay
939	Good idea to give them a heads up.
940	Please call Bruce Silvers with Bingham & Dana in Hartford, Conn, and tell him my trip has rescheduled.
940	Please see if he is available to meet on Monday afternoon, preferably in New York (although I'll confirm later).
940	I think it might be helpful if Nick Palatin was available as well.
940	Thanks, Kay
941	Forgot to mention that.
941	Please ask Bruce to check his availability.
942	fyi.
942	I'll respond later.
942	Back to the contract....
943	We might want to consider meeting with the FuelCell team in their offices, if this is less intimidating for them.
943	I may be able to fly up on Monday am and accomplish what I need to do with BD, although flying on Sunday is fine as well.
943	TBD.
943	Kay
944	Fred, I think Kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of paper.
944	I trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements, subject to my quick review and the review of local counsel.
944	Thanks for your cooperation.
945	I made a mad dash to get this revised.
945	I can't promise that I incorporated everything we discussed, but I figured I needed to get it to you now.
946	Are these the ones which didn't have the date?
946	This is PITIFUL.
947	Hi Gregg, I've been tied up today so I haven't gotten this to you.
947	Maybe we can talk soon.
947	Kay
948	Thanks for checking.
948	I'm on message 7 of 9, and don't have anything from Bruce.
948	Sorry I was cranking this am.
948	I got here at 600am, mostly because I had problems with a document which had to go out today.
948	Kay
949	I'm in good shape now.
949	Just a little left for today.
949	Is Ric getting sentimental?
949	Losing someone can make you feel that way, even if it isn't logical.
949	We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow.
950	Stuart, Kay's venting for the day: Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?
950	Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having problems.
950	Have you mentioned anything to him?
950	Kay
951	FYI.
951	I haven't read it yet, but thought I would pass it along anyway.
951	Kay
952	I don't know if you are in the loop on this one.
953	I may just ask him if anyone else has had problems with the quality of their work, and leave out the billing stuff.
953	If I say anything I won't mention you,although I think you did what you could to control these cowboys.
953	Kay
954	Hmm.
954	Can you get a picture of the dog?
954	Neil and I have been talking about getting Michael a dog, and we DO NOT want a puppy.
954	Does she bark much?
954	Is she hyper?
954	She's a short haired dog, isn't she?
954	The problem with the document arose after you left yesterday, and I knew I had to get cracking on it early.
954	I would have had to ask you to be here by 700, and I figure that was just too much to ask!
954	Thanks anyway.
955	It is yours.
955	I never said it would last.
955	If fact, it is a tribute to Enron that that era is over.
955	You've earned the right to doubt my credibility based on your original interview, however.
956	PS.
956	You will love the government contracting business.
956	Really, I think you will.
957	Here's the redraft.
957	I fix up the form for you as well.
957	Next email.
958	And with this email I bid you adieu, hasta manana, ciao, etc. Kay
959	I may be in trouble!!!
960	I didn't know he was 50!!!
961	Yes, thank you so much.
961	It is displayed proudly in my office.
961	It is sooo cute!
962	Hi Stuart, I'm assuming (very dangerous) that you are handling this, as this project does not ring a bell with me.
962	Kay
963	The attached contains revisions and comments as compiled by EECC and ENA.
963	Kay
964	I will be out of town, but I think you should definitely be there.
964	I'll mention it to Sheila.
964	Kay
965	Please.
965	Tuesday afternoon is our best bet, in NYC.
965	Kay
966	I'm glad she sounds so good.
966	Maybe she can be a back up for next Thursday.
966	Kay
967	I think we arrive around 215, so 400 is about as good as we can do.
967	Kay
968	Is this something I should have Heather Brown participate in?
968	Kay
969	Hi Heather, Are you available to participate?
969	I'm not sure what is on the agenda, but I thought I should check your availability.
969	Thanks, Kay
970	FYI.
970	Kay
971	I couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you, so here 'tis.
971	Kay
972	Karen, As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.
972	I will add that I think that it is the City which has preserved its option as to who repairs the road since they have approval authority.
972	However, this doesn't seem like a big issue to me.
972	So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk profile, I'm happy.
972	Kay
973	Any problems/comments?
974	We don't need her if we aren't going to discuss the loan.
974	Have you heard from Sara?
974	I was under the impression that she is out of town this week.
974	Guess I could walk over there and look.
974	Kay
975	Just to keep you in the loop.
976	Heather, Doesn't look like this will apply to you.
976	The person we need to include in our discussion is out of town.
976	Talk to you soon, Kay
977	Janet and Ben, Ben now has signature authority up to $250,000.
977	Let me know if you have any questions, Kay
978	Per your request.
978	Is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract?
978	I'm supposed to be working on the changes necessary to make this one 97-10 compliant, but I haven't done it yet.
978	Maybe you will beat me to it, which is fine by me.
978	Kay
979	Darn.
980	Hi there!
980	Sounds like things are going really well.
980	Neil is working tomorrow (his turn), then we have a wedding to go to Saturday night.
980	Paige isn't coming in until Sunday, leaving Tuesday or Wednesday.
980	She's visiting friends in Waco.
980	You know how it goes with juniors.
980	So, it doesn't look good for us to make it to Palacios this weekend.
980	How long are you going to be there?
980	Gotta get on the phone.
980	Love, Kay
981	Please cancel this.
981	Kay Mann
982	Please make this right.
982	Thanks, Kay
983	We don't have to meet with them....
984	Lee, Your changes to the letter look fine to me.
984	I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.
984	Are we ready to go with this one?
984	We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.
984	I believe GE prepared #4.
984	Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently deleted from my computer.
984	Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.
984	Thanks, Kay
985	Lisa, Here is the discussion draft of change order #3 for your review, comment, changes, etc. Once it is finalized ENA would appreciate receiving a note requesting that the change order be executed, with the change order initialled by the appropriate person at ESA.
985	Thanks, Kay
986	Ben wants Chris to sign this change order.
986	I believe it is in essentially the same form as when I sent it before.
986	Please advise is there are any changes you want made.
986	Thanks, Kay
987	Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?
987	I think on most Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.
987	I don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.
987	Buy you really don't need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to Palacios - makes the fun last longer.
987	We won't even celebrate our anniversary until the weekend, as I will be out of town Tuesday-Wednesday (New York), and Neil is gone Thursday-Friday (Dallas).
987	Tag team parenting!
987	Love, Kay
988	Lee, Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions: I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer, so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.
988	I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as well.
988	It is percolating through the system.
988	Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending the delivery dates?
988	I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.
988	I'll be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.
988	Kay
989	Thanks.
989	Unless someone catches me, I'm out at 430.
990	I don't know.
990	I'll ask Suzanne.
991	For the calendar.
992	Richard, When you get a minute I would like to catch you up on these issues.
992	I think it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two Westinghouse issues we have.
992	Thanks, Kay
993	Lisa, Per your request.
993	Kay
994	Karen, Please provide a redline version of this document against the Fehr option, or whichever previous document you started with.
994	Thanks, Kay
995	She makes me crazy the way she copies three lawyers in her firm eveytime she writes me.
995	A pet peeve!
996	I leave tomorrow, and will be back on Thursday.
996	There's a bunch of food up here today.
996	You might want to make the trip up this way.
997	Hi Kathy, I can't remember if you are in the loop on this one.
997	Kay
998	Hi Bart, I think this is at least close to the final draft.
998	It ain't pretty but it seemed to work.
998	You won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions, so long as I get a copy of the new-and-improved version.
998	Kay
999	I am so sorry to hear about Annie.
999	Did it break in a different place?
999	I think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell what is happening.
999	Michael had a good time.
999	Thanks for having him.
999	He was SOOO excited when Paige got home yesterday.
999	He is just crazy for her.
999	Thanks for the bird house.
999	We are going to put it in the kitchen on top of the cabinets.
999	All is fine here.
999	Just buzy as usual!
999	Love, Kay
1000	Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending account?
1000	I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.
1000	My records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.
1000	Love, Kay
1001	Did you RSVP for me as well?
1001	That would be extra points!
1002	I haven't looked at this yet...
1002	Kay
1003	Hi Gregg, My initial reaction is that it is ok for a small gambling debt, but a little thin for a $50m revolving line of credit.
1003	Kay
1004	I found it.
1005	Hi Sweetie, You know how Paige is about directions, etc. Feel free to call her, though.
1005	I ate all vegetables for lunch, but then I had a third cookie.
1005	Annie broke her arm again, and may have to have surgery.
1005	Kay
1006	Latest.
1006	I think it just changes my seat assignment.
1006	Kay
1007	Heather, I'm guessing that Peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit agreement.
1007	Maybe I'm wrong.
1007	Kay
1008	That should be easy enough.
1008	Paige needs some glasses, and that could run Dental is also covered, if we have any uncovered dental expenses.
1008	I'm going to guess we might have another $100 in prescriptions to fill this year as well.
1008	I could stand some new glasses also.
1008	Your Eckerd's glasses can also be submitted.
1008	We need to forecast for next year, as open enrollment starts soon.
1008	Kay
1009	Remind me to check the Harry & David's catalogue for something nifty.
1009	Kay
1010	I'm O positive, and used to work with Bob.
1010	I'm on the road until Thursday afternoon, and give give blood on Friday.
1010	Kay
1011	fyi, for fuel cells and CRRA
1012	Hi Dale, I would contact Kathy Clark.
1012	As far as I know, there have been no change orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).
1012	Kay
1013	Did you get these?
1013	Kay
1014	We must hang together less we hang separately.
1015	Are these the correct dates on Change Order #4?
1016	Is this ok with everybody?
1016	It incorporates GE's latest comments.
1016	Kay
1017	FYI.
1018	I need details.
1019	Chris Calger will sign for ENA on #2.
1019	I believe his title is a vice president.
1019	Dale Rasmussen has offered to handle signature.
1019	I haven't gone through all my emails to see if it is ready to go.
1019	Janet will sign #3 and #4.
1019	Kay
1020	I think the effective dates have been relating to when the deal was cut.
1020	That's as much a guess as anything.
1020	Ben left me a voice mail that said he had gotten something from ESA on #3, but I haven't made it through all my emails to see if I have it.
1020	I will send it to you if I do, of course.
1020	I would think #4 is ready as soon as I get confirmation that the dates are correct.
1020	Again, I have to check my emails.
1020	I heard a rumor about 5 (but am now drawing a blank), and haven't heard of any others.
1020	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1021	This deal never closed, so it must be the perfect contract....
1022	Please print and add to my Fuel Cell book.
1022	Thanks.
1022	Kay ps please print a second copy for John however you spell Clawburg.
1023	Hi Chris, Any opinion on the major component question?
1023	Kay
1024	Carlos, Having some difficulty finding another job?
1024	Happy Anniversary.
1024	Sorry I wasn't here to take you to lunch.
1024	Kay
1025	Kathy Clark as EECC has the electronic version of the turbine contract.
1025	Rob Taylor at Andrew & Kurth probably has the electronic files for the other document.
1025	Rose Engeldorf might have the electronic files as well.
1025	Kay Enron Global Finance
1026	Hi Paul, Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?
1026	Looks like we might have some business.
1026	I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had any comments.
1026	I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss it.
1026	How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?
1026	Thanks, Kay
1027	Hi Guys, I think the price of the turbines will be the internal Enron price.
1027	Sheila has the magic number per turbine.
1027	Kay
1028	Hi Kent, I was wondering if we could schedule a conference call to discuss the form of these agreements.
1028	Are you available any time soon?
1028	Thanks, Kay
1029	I have a conference call that starts around 1030 and is scheduled to go to 1230.
1029	Otherwise, no lunch plans.
1029	Kay
1030	Viola.
1031	If you don't hear from me by 1245, I probably won't be having lunch.
1032	Could you please get me some post it notes, various sizes, cool colors preferred.
1032	Thanks!
1033	I'm still in my conference call.
1033	Do you want to come visit later (in other words, need to get out?)
1034	Please print and put in folder, Off Balance Sheet EPC Contract.
1034	Thanks, Kay
1035	If I had a printer, I wouldn't ask you to print this, but since I don't....
1035	Thanks, Kay PS Don't worry too much about Ruthie.
1035	You'll get her figured out.
1036	Is it true that tomorrow is your birthday?
1036	If so, Happy Birthday!!!
1037	You did better than I did.
1037	I was telling people I was 41 when I was 42.
1037	I felt terrible when I realized I was older than I thought!
1037	Oh well, it just goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.
1037	I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the same group and process.
1037	Neat trick, though.
1037	I wish Carlos was here to do a lot of this, though.
1037	Kay
1038	Why don't you try feeding her again at night?
1038	Maybe she will sleep better.
1038	I feed Jack twice a day, and he is still skinny as a stick.
1038	Isn't she on the thin side anyway?
1038	All dogs go through adjustments.
1038	She may be trying to find out who is the boss.
1038	There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you are the boss.
1038	I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.
1038	CRATE TRAIN HER!!
1038	It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.
1038	She may fuss at first, but she will love it.
1038	Crating her will calm her down.
1038	I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.
1039	Ta da...
1040	Joe, Would you like to renew with a letter agreement as in previous years?
1040	Thanks, Kay
1041	I've been out of town, and have back-to-back meetings/conference calls.
1041	I'll call you though.
1041	Kay
1042	fyi.
1042	This form came from Global Finance.
1043	Have a great trip!
1044	Hi Gregg, Per your request: See ya, Kay
1045	Hi guys, In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI.
1045	I have these questions: 1.
1045	I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.
1045	Is this referring to the Fuel Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer?
1045	I know this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the construction activities.
1045	2.
1045	He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts.
1045	Does anyone care?
1045	3.
1045	Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests?
1045	We have discussed with FCE the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.
1045	Also, are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?
1045	Is our fee at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform?
1045	Thanks, Kay
1046	Barbara, here is the document I discussed concerning some of the Chicago stuff.
1046	Jeff, I don't know if you have received this from Gregg all ready.
1046	Kay
1047	I've given blood at MD Anderson before, and I think they will have the blood type information on file.
1047	If anyone else is in the same boat, you call the number below and ask for Barbara.
1047	I couldn't reach her today, because it is Saturday, but they tell me she will be in on Monday.
1047	If all goes well, I could be in business fairly quickly.
1047	Kay
1048	I don't know if you got this, so here 'tis.
1048	I was out of town and missed the presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these issues.
1048	I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet treatment of power plants.
1048	Kay
1049	I understand completely.
1049	Those ear infections can be very painful.
1049	Nothing can get to you like your kid in pain.
1049	If it makes you feel any better I have a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable), and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections, etc. My oldest also had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.
1049	But she out grew the problem.
1049	I expect to be in town Mon-Thurs, with high hopes of taking Friday off to join my husband at his officer's meeting in San Antonio.
1049	Kay
1050	My morning is fairly open, other than grinding on the purchase contract.
1051	I'm available.
1051	As I mentioned, I'm still working away on the revised equipment contract.
1051	Kay
1052	Heather, Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time?
1052	It would help me get finished with the FCE doc.
1052	I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging.
1052	I wonder if that makes ONSI a part of GE?
1052	Does GE have a fuel cell product yet?
1052	It would explain the statement in the Journal that headquarters would not be in NJ or Connecticut.
1052	Kay
1053	Shall I handle items #1 and 2?
1053	Kay
1054	I am waiting for a call back from MD Anderson concerning whether they were able to locate my information.
1054	Their records go back to 1998, and I believe I gave at MD Anderson in 1998, but you know how that is.
1054	Assuming that all goes well, I can go tomorrow at 930am (when they open. I'll keep everybody posted. The folks at MDA confirmed that they have Michael's consent forms ready to go, just in case that question should arise. Bob, sorry to hear about the doctor, and the impact it must have had on Michael. Kay
1055	I'm going to guess that it depends on whether you are giving a direct donation (as in this case) or a replacement donation.
1055	Since it is for a specific patient, they may want to make sure it works, especially since it will keep you from donating for a while.
1055	Just a guess!
1056	How's this?
1057	okey dokey
1058	I think Piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat.
1058	He's a sly one.
1058	Roger's first story was ok ("I didn't think he was running, I was tossing the bat to our bat boy").
1058	Second version was a little iffy ("I didn't know if I had the bat or the ball" - why the hell would he throw the ball towards the dugout?) The Turner wedding was amazing.
1058	Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the wedding.
1058	Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving.
1058	When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents) the band was still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.
1058	Unbelievable.
1058	I wonder how late it went.
1058	I'm out of town this weekend - Neil's officer's meeting at the Hyatt Hill Country, then up to see Paige on Saturday, back on Sunday.
1058	Let me know if it reschedules.
1058	Did you change jobs?
1058	What do you hear from Ben?
1058	Anthony called me last week, just to chat.
1058	They are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here.
1058	Kay
1059	Did you hear Candy is moving to Holland?
1059	She looked great.
1059	I didn't know she was married until I saw her.
1059	She seems happy.
1059	Sounds like Ben found a good head hunter.
1059	It can be hard to get positive after being in that environment.
1059	Kay
1060	I'm thinking you don't have anything to move.
1060	Maybe it would help if you acknowledged that ENA might not be your final destination, but seems like a good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites, such as Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets - both new businesses with international aspects.
1060	Plus, lawyers at ENA move between groups without much fuss and bother (if it changes, don't blame me later!) How does that sound?
1060	Kay
1061	Paul, FYI.
1061	This is the document which starts the move into the ABB facility agreements.
1061	Kay
1062	To keep you in the loop.
1062	Kay
1063	Is everyone available for a brief conference call at 830 Tuesday morning?
1063	Please let me know if you aren't available.
1063	Dial in instructions will be forthcoming.
1063	Thanks, Kay
1064	Do you want to generate one just like the rest?
1064	That would be the easiest way to go.
1064	Thanks, Kay
1065	Paul, When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement?
1065	It is getting urgent.
1065	Thanks, Kay
1066	The attached is marked to show changes from previous draft seen by CRRA.
1066	Kay
1067	Hi Matt, Sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by Global Finance for Turbopark (does this ring a bell?) If you can get me the docs on this LLC, I'll see if we can pitch the angle Sheila suggested.
1067	Thanks, Kay
1068	Ok.
1068	I'll follow up.
1068	The insanity continues.
1068	I finally called Lee Johnson at S&S, who fortunately had called me, and asked him if he knew if Kent was around, as I hadn't heard from him.
1068	He is going to get in touch with Kent for me.
1068	I'm expediting Paul Pipitone re the ABB facility agreement, but haven't heard back from him yet.
1068	Hope your trip is going well.
1068	Kay
1069	Hi David, It is just us chickens, Gregg's agenda.
1069	Kay
1070	Hi Jeff, I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted.
1070	I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a friend's son who has leukemia.
1070	I don't think it will take too long, but they don't open until 930.
1070	Kay
1071	In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with Peoples.
1071	It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.
1071	Gas would be a plus.
1071	I've used Jones, Day (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad experience).
1071	Any suggestions?
1071	Thanks, Kay
1072	Kathleen, We have forms for confidentiality agreements.
1072	All CA's are processed through Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.
1072	Kay, could you point Kathleen to the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft?
1072	By the way, I've assembled the emails I received on changing the form.
1072	I'll be happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start with.
1072	I know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard.
1072	Thanks, Kay
1073	I'll get the draft working, but it would probably be a good idea to discuss this a bit.
1073	Kay
1074	Is this a PIG deal?
1075	Remember when the biggest accounting issues were mark-to-market?
1075	Ahh, the good old days.
1075	Kay
1076	Please prepare a fed ex package to go out tonight, as described below.
1076	Also, please prepare a transmittal letter to Heather for me to sign.
1076	Thanks, Kay
1077	Janet has already signed Change Order #2, so adding value to this one will required that change order #3 be revised, then we would have to go back to ESA for their approval.
1077	It would be easier on this end if we could pick up the new stuff in this one to a subsequent change order?
1077	I spoke to Lee Johnson yesterday about all the change orders, and a couple of outstanding issues.
1077	I am having difficulty getting GE's attention on the facility agreements, and would prefer that the change orders not be given to GE until I at least get a call back on the issue.
1077	If this is a problem, please let me know.
1077	Kay
1078	Thanks.
1078	This is a very drastic situation, so the draft will be appreciated.
1078	As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility agreement, deleting the WestLB references.
1078	When will this be forthcoming?
1078	Thanks, Kay
1079	Bob, My donor number is 1181819.
1079	Let me know if Michael needs more.
1079	As you know, I can go back in 56 days.
1079	Here's hoping all goes well.
1079	I'll have your family in my thoughts and prayers.
1079	Kay
1080	Joe, Here tis: C. Kay Mann Sr. Counsel Enron North America 1400 Smith, Suite 3841 Thanks, Kay
1081	Sheila, I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.
1081	Can we adjust the time of the GE call?
1081	I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market stuff, but I could be wrong.
1081	I just don't get the feeling that it is directed to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.
1081	Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?
1081	I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.
1081	A & K really dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.
1081	I still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.
1081	I hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.
1081	Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish (Honeywell).
1081	I heard it increases their size by a third.
1081	So I guess the 800 pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla.
1081	(ok, I admit I used the calculator).
1081	Talk to you soon, Kay
1082	To all, As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.
1082	I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through WestLB, and the change orders related to same.
1082	All I know about is the LM deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).
1082	Please let me know if you are aware of any others.
1082	Thanks, Kay
1083	Can you send me a copy of a professional service agreement?
1083	I need to prepare one.
1084	Stephen, Wanna go ahead and print the tasking letter and I'll initial it?
1084	Kay
1085	Thanks for the help.
1085	I'm sure more questions will follow!
1085	Kay
1086	Thanks.
1087	YEAH!!!!
1087	Something I can put on the list and take off!
1087	Shall I send it directly to Tracy?
1087	Talk to you at 1100.
1087	Kay
1088	I thought you would enjoy this.
1088	And I didn't make any comments about being right about not going to a MEGA university.
1089	Ok.
1089	When are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues we need to address to get this wrapped up?
1089	Thanks, Kay
1090	Let's aim for Thursday am.
1090	I'll get back to you later today.
1090	Thanks, Kay
1091	Hi Kathy, I know I owe you a phone call.
1091	I'm home with a sick kid today.
1091	Please email me your number and I'll give you a call.
1091	I can't believe I've forgotten it.
1091	So how are you doing with the EECC changes?
1091	Kay
1092	Hope it is going well out there.
1092	Michael is sick (I'm guessing strep), so I'll be calling in from home today.
1092	Kay
1093	Hi Scott, It is a sick kid day (I'm guessing strep, with the 102 plus fever).
1093	Fortunately, I have most of what I need to get a draft of the equipment contract turned.
1093	I'll email it later.
1093	Kay
1094	Hi Gregg, I'm home with my sick son this am.
1094	(It was one of those 102 plus fevers at 430 this morning.) I've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff sent out so we can get some work done.
1094	Talk to you later, Kay
1095	Hi Scott, I have some questions: The obligation to try to improve performance about the specific performance (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.
1095	Do you have a sense for the appropriate time period here?
1095	Would it make sense to require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?
1095	Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we need to put words around it.
1095	I know we discussed the need for pilings as the most significant change.
1095	Do you think that this difference is enough?
1095	Did I understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard foundations (as opposed to a credit).
1095	On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some monitoring ability.
1095	On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.
1095	I was thinking of using something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.
1095	Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact payment?
1095	Thanks, Kay
1096	Hi.
1096	Don't forget you can reach me by email.
1096	Good catch on the fever this am!
1096	Love, Kay
1097	Maybe it is viral.
1097	I haven't really looked because I want Rey to see him since we are leaving town, so my opinion isn't as important.
1097	He is starting to slow just a little.
1097	He ate a good breakfast, but he is getting quieter.
1098	If it is ok with you I'll let you know in a little bit.
1099	More questions: We have two different levels of guarantee values.
1099	We have the specific performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc. This includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and discharge).
1099	Will all of these have more stringent guaranteed levels that FCE will have to work to try to fix?
1099	I'm assuming there are no sound issues.
1099	Thanks again, Kay
1100	How's Annie doing?
1100	Has she seen her regular (sigh) orthopod yet?
1100	Do the girls (and I guess you grown ups can probably go, too) want to go to SU?
1100	Are the young ladies interested in spending the night?
1100	I'm home with Michael (the 102 fever drill), working at home.
1100	Hi to all!
1100	Love, Kay PS Thanks for the traffic tip.
1100	Do the games last about 4 hours?
1100	I can't remember.
1101	Why not.
1101	You can tell how much Michael seems to be enjoying school.
1102	Please print and fax to me at 713 973 0287.
1102	I'll forward a couple more I need faxed.
1102	Thanks Kay
1103	Please print and fax to me at home.
1103	Thanks
1104	Here's what they suggested (yes I'm working, I can do two things at once) There is a rule of halves - you can give half to your kids, you get medicaid when the retained half runs out.
1104	There is probably a time period you can do this.
1104	Kay
1105	Here's a redline against our previous draft.
1105	There are lots of holes, in large part due to the significant commercial issues still open and some of FCE's input due on the language to be used.
1105	I'm also not finished with the project management/scheduling stuff, but I wanted you to get a chance to look at it forthwith.
1105	Scott, I've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input.
1105	I don't know when we want to give FuelCells a draft, but I'm going to keep working on this one.
1105	Kay
1106	Good.
1106	That lets me massage it, review my notes, and perhaps even read it!
1106	Kay
1107	I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician, so it depends on how long that takes.
1107	I'll find the instructions and email them to you.
1107	If I'm not on there but Kent is, could you let him know I really need to talk to hiim?
1107	Thanks Kay
1108	The appointment with the pediatrician is at 1100.
1108	I catch up with you later today.
1108	Kay
1109	you can open it and hold it.
1109	I know what it is.
1110	Hi Barbara, I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.
1110	I'm familiar with the people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.
1110	Kay
1111	I'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as I have strep throat (Michael and I got a group rate at the peditricians' office.) Who should I contact?
1111	Kay
1112	Claude, Could you please fax this to Heather?
1112	You might want to call her to make sure she is still at McCary's office.
1112	Thanks, Kay
1113	Scott, Your question #2 raises a good point.
1113	My thought in bracketing the name is optionality.
1113	I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.
1113	As you know, if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.
1113	As far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in the title chain.
1113	I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for financing purposes or otherwise).
1113	In that case, we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later.
1113	I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what we need to keep in mind.
1113	Kay
1114	Poor Carlos.
1114	He is almost pitiful.
1114	I think it is a great idea to watch for a good networking opportunity.
1114	I'm off on Friday, too.
1114	In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and spent the day at home.
1114	I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow.
1114	Is Norman still out of town?
1114	Will you have the house ALL to yourself?
1114	Kay
1115	SZ really grows on you, doesn't he?
1115	Just like Carlos.
1115	Neil leaves tomorrow.
1115	He was out ONE night last week.
1115	I am encouraging him to get a hunting lease.
1115	He thinks I'm very supportive.
1116	Sounds good.
1116	I'm home with strep (mine and my son's), so I'll catch up tomorrow.
1116	Kay
1117	I'm planning on taking your emails and revising the current draft to create a new one.
1117	Your points were very well thought out, so I would like to have the day to get a new draft.
1117	It looks like I will be at home tomorrow since I'm still not feeling well, but I certainly feel well enough to work on the contract.
1117	Perhaps we will get some input from our team in Conn. gang by noon.
1117	How does this sound?
1117	Stephen, Feel free to weigh in with any comments/suggestions.
1117	Your input is welcome.
1117	Kay PS I can now print at home.
1118	Peter, Thanks for the update.
1118	By the way, is the new version in Word?
1118	Kay
1119	Sounds like a good plan.
1119	I can't wait to hear how it went in Danbury.
1119	Sounds like the CRRA meeting went well.
1119	Kay
1120	Hi Charlotte, I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.
1120	Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.
1120	He is on two antibiotics which he takes twice a day.
1120	I'm trying to figure out how to get these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.
1120	Obviously, if Michael isn't doing great I won't go.
1120	Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad when he has fever.
1120	He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.
1120	Just let me know if you aren't comfortable with the situation.
1120	I can always leave on Saturday, or not at all.
1120	Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.
1120	His wife (and assistant) is Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc. We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234.
1120	Saturday night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.
1120	Michael says hi, by the way.
1120	He is watching me type this.
1120	Kay
1121	That would be great.
1121	We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.
1121	I know he will have things he wants to bring to show you.
1121	Michael asked me for advice yesterday.
1121	("Mom, I have a problem...").
1121	He now has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.
1121	He was torn.
1121	He decided to stick with Ashley.
1121	Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!!
1121	Michael is very excited about the weekend.
1121	He just doesn't think it will be long enough!!
1121	Thanks for everything, Kay
1122	He hasn't left yet, but I'll remind him.
1122	Michael gets his school picture taken tomorrow.
1122	Carol Junell takes the pcitures there.
1122	She did our first family portrait after Michael was born.
1122	Kay
1123	Will do.
1124	Hi Stuart, I'm home sick (and with my sick son) again today, but wanted to get this to you.
1124	Kay
1125	Hi Rose, I'm home sick with a sick kid, but I wanted to make sure you got this little bit of info.
1125	Kay
1126	Hi Dale, I thought I'd send this along.
1126	It is the first draft of the "break out" contract for the ABB transformers which go with the LM's.
1126	I thought Sheila told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the LM break out in shape.
1126	This has not been reviewed with ABB yet (in fact, I haven't read it yet), but just in case you want to give it a look, I thought I would pass it along.
1126	Kay
1127	FYI.
1127	I had previously asked Paul to revise the LM contract to remove all of the references to WestLB.
1127	Kay
1128	If Jeff is happy, I'm happy.
1128	Kay
1129	I'm still at home.
1129	I'll be in tomorrow.
1129	I have a fax machine at home, though, if you prefer.
1129	Otherwise, we can see who we can scare up at the office, or you can have Laura sign and I'll initial later.
1129	Which do you prefer?
1129	Kay
1130	It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it.
1130	I can print it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever you want.
1130	Plus, I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer she hasn't dealt with initial it.
1130	She is very conscientious about what she signs, and who initials what.
1130	Is the attached form the final final form?
1130	Where and to whom do you want it faxed?
1130	Thanks, Kay
1131	I'm working on it now.
1131	Maybe we (Enron) could review it tomorrow morning, then send it to FCE.
1131	I can meet around 10:00.
1131	That way, we can get it to them in time for weekend review.
1131	Does that work?
1131	Kay
1132	Sounds good.
1132	The email was a good idea, also.
1133	Any problem if I add signature lines on the last page of the document (prior to the exhibits)?
1133	I can do that.
1134	Here's the final final final.
1134	I had to put in a page break before one of the exhibits because it wasn't printing right.
1135	Michael probably won't be at school tomorrow, unless he really perks up quickly.
1135	However, I was thinking of bringing him up there to get his picture taken, if he feels up to it.
1135	Do you think there would be a problem with that?
1135	Any idea when and where I should take him?
1135	Thanks!
1135	Kay
1136	Charlotte, Michael hasn't bounced back yet - still getting fever up to 102.
1136	I spoke with Delores, and she said Rey said that Michael had a pretty good dose of strep, so it will take 6 doses of medicine to get it under control.
1136	I'll see how he is in the early am, but I may not take him to school, just so I can watch him another few hours.
1136	If you will be at your office tomorrow I'll let you know how he's doing.
1136	Maybe I can leave on Saturday.
1136	I know he will be very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend.
1136	Kay
1137	By the way, did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of?
1138	Looks fine to me.
1138	Kay
1139	Michael is still running 102 fever.
1139	I spoke to the doctor again today, and he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.
1139	I'm feeling better, though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.
1139	In fact, Christy Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.
1139	I'll explain later.
1139	If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them to you.
1139	Have a great day tomorrow.
1139	Kay
1140	Hi Charlotte, Poor thing woke up with 101.6.
1140	He isn't getting any worse, which means the medicine is doing something, but it just hasn't done the trick yet.
1140	I'll give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute.
1140	I just can't take him to school until he is better.
1140	I would like to hold the option open to bring him in the am.
1140	Once the medicine kicks in, he will bounce back quickly.
1140	Kay
1141	Karen Jones (in Portland) and Sheila Tweed have been working on just the same thing, so I'm forwarding your request to them.
1141	Kay
1142	FYI
1143	Here's today's version.
1143	Michael is still running a fairly high fever, so it would be a big help if we can talk via phone.
1143	Kay
1144	Yes.
1144	If you called 713 973 6325, it is the number my computer is on.
1144	I'll log off before 1000 so you can call on that number when you are ready.
1144	Kay
1145	Sorry to hear about this weekend.
1145	It is kind of sad that Mary Susan doesn't have other options for her birthday.
1145	Not that you guys aren't fun....
1145	Michael and I've been home with strep since Wednesday.
1145	He hasn't gotten better, but I have.
1145	So, I'm not going to San Antonion, just heading for GTown tomorrow.
1145	I haven't decided whether I'm taking Michael.
1145	If he is feeling better, I'll leave him with his sitter, Charlotte.
1145	Since he has been ill, I'll probably head back to Houston EARLY on Sunday, and won't wait for Paige to get up.
1145	Sorry it didn't work out with girls, but I understand.
1145	Love, Kay
1146	I changed the plant stuff around, swapping most of them for Facility.
1146	I think it is a bit more clear now.
1146	Let me know what else needs to be done.
1146	I'll be leaving in around 1230 to buy a bribe, I mean pumpkin, but we won't be gone long.
1146	Kay
1147	Gloria, I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded locally.
1147	The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file, and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe rev 2).
1147	The new document is the one below.
1147	Please save the redline verision in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll, Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.
1147	Thanks, Kay
1148	Never a dull moment!
1148	It is hard to get deals done at Enron, which as shareholders we should probably be glad.
1148	Chicago is only slightly more difficult because of the utility angle - and mind set.
1148	Michael's temperature STILL hasn't gone done.
1148	And of course, now the weekend is coming.
1148	I guess it is time to call the doctor again.
1148	And you!
1148	Kay
1149	This is suitable for framing.
1150	Thanks.
1150	Who was able to do it?
1150	Kay
1151	Neil left town yesterday.
1151	I can't really complain since he rarely travels.
1151	However, he is welcome to pamper upon his return!
1151	Kay
1152	She compared the wrong versions.
1152	I'll try again.
1153	Sorry I lost my temper.
1153	I guess I'm not accustomed to being transferred to someone else to get things done.
1153	No reason to lose my temper, though.
1153	Kay
1154	I had heard that the big E bought out the minority investors last summer.
1154	Hadn't seen this coming.
1154	So what's next for Azurix?
1155	I'm just now printing it out (takes about 15 minutes), but I'm fine with sending out the redline.
1155	Kay
1156	Water is just as liquid as gas.
1156	So to speak.
1157	You'll be happy to know that it didn't take long.
1158	You might want to request ComparRite, just in case it comes up again.
1158	There's isn't any problem getting - both Suz and I have it.
1158	Have a good weekend.
1158	Kay
1159	Dear Mr. Schrum, I attended Sing!
1159	last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her Tri Delta friends.
1159	I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which were within the bounds of what I expected.
1159	Unfortunately, I am not writing to tell you how much I enjoyed it.
1159	I'm writing you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.
1159	The act was beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children present.
1159	During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there were 4 young children sitting in the front.
1159	In fact, at the end of the first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother to watch her perform.
1159	I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring Michael.
1159	Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.
1159	I was glad I had moved back at intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.
1159	Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion.
1159	It was offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university which prides itself on "encouraging contributions toward the well-being of humanity".
1159	My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me in this request.
1159	Thank you, Kay Mann 29 Inverness Parkway Houston, Texas 77055
1160	I'm checking your desk for pom-poms.
1161	Carlos, you have much wisdom for such a young buckeroo.
1161	If Debbie can't decide and if you can't use the PaperCity photo (it realy is a good pic), I'd go with the first one.
1161	I must say that all of them look pretty, well, serious.
1161	Kinda Gore-like, you know.
1161	Ok, that was a low blow.
1161	I was just kidding!!
1161	Kay
1162	I was out sick Wed-Fri, but now I'm back.
1162	Kay
1163	Hi John, Sorry I missed your call last week.
1163	I was out ill.
1163	I'll give you a call once I dig out from under the paper.
1163	Kay
1164	Mr. Keffer, Asking this crowd to vote was like throwing chum to sharks.
1164	Kay
1165	I didn't get your fax last week.
1165	I was out sick so I didn't call Shirley.
1165	Could you resend it?
1165	Thanks, Kay
1166	Hi Paul, I would like to change my previous response to this email.
1166	I would like to get a cleaned up version of the GE contract (without WestLB references) so that I can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the references to WestLB.
1166	The intial read from GE was positive, but the devil is in the details, of course.
1166	Kay
1167	Hi Kathleen, Is the Peoples confidentiality agreement moving closer to the top of the list?
1167	Thanks, Kay
1168	Hi Charlotte, I'm not sure what we are doing at Thanksgiving, but at the most we might go to Palacios, which means that we would be gone no more than Thursday and maybe Friday night.
1168	I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet, but I know we need to get organized.
1168	Also, I think Michael is out of school that Wednesday.
1168	Again, I need to check.
1168	More to come.
1168	As for tomorrow (BOO), we forgot to watch for sundown.
1168	I know, that is hard to believe.
1168	We will update tomorrow!
1168	Kay
1169	Well, once again I'm messed up on my calendar.
1169	I thought you were going to be in FW a couple more days.
1169	Michael tried callling yesterday (I think it was yesterday), but of course we missed.
1169	I think I'm in town this week (cross fingers).
1169	I was home with Michael three days last week - we both had strep, but he was worse.
1169	His fever didn't break for a couple of days, so I had to cancel my trip to San Antonio to join Neil at his officer's meeting.
1169	I did make it to Georgetown, and had a nice time with Paige.
1169	We are hoping for cooler weather soon.
1169	It is muggy!
1169	Tell Dad hi, and happy fishing.
1169	Love, Kay
1170	I may be able to back up Bart if he has a problem.
1170	I have a conference call scheduled but it is likely to reschedule until later in the day.
1170	Kay
1171	SU was fun, but there was a little incident with a streaker (more like a stroller on stage).
1171	Otherwise, it was great.
1171	Paige did really well, and she was front and center for most of their act.
1171	I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.
1171	Neil and I are negotiating.
1171	I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.
1171	It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.
1171	Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday night.
1171	Hi to all!
1171	Love, Kay
1172	Gentlemen, Here's the most recent version of the equipment contract.
1172	I am including a ComparRite redline version, comparing this version to the Oct 11 version sent by Enron.
1172	I look forward to speaking with you soon, Kay
1173	Ross, The email was sent last night, with no indication that it did not go through.
1173	Must be the cybergoblins.
1173	I will resend PLUS attach the documents to this reply.
1173	Kay
1174	Once again....
1175	They have received it but not opened it yet.
1175	Kay
1176	What does your schedule look like Wednesday am?
1176	Thanks, Kay
1177	They should now have at least 3 emails with the contract.
1177	I suspect they may have 4.
1177	I'll know next time!
1177	Kay
1178	We've swapped voice mails.
1178	I suspect I'll hear from him this am.
1178	Kay
1179	Kinda spooky since they are a technology driven company!
1180	1)The cybergoblins ate the attachment.
1180	2) OK 3) Which Peoples is it?
1180	Also, I think enovate should sign at CA.
1180	4) I sent Heather an email re her availability.
1180	There's a bunch of construction near downtown, so I would hesitate to commit to an early call, but I know I'm free after 300 tomorrow.
1180	Kay
1181	Suzanne is going to track down Heather, then will call you to confirm if 330 works.
1181	Kay
1182	The loan documents you prepared.
1183	We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron commercial/financial team. I don't know the substance of the comments. Kay
1184	I forgot about the fence.
1184	I'm still planning on leaving early - maybe 430 or earlier.
1184	Can you leave early, too?
1184	Michael wanted to do something with the spider web.
1184	I would offer to pick Michael up, but I'm not sure that I would beat you if I left at 430 and you left at 500.
1184	Love,
1185	Kinda of like a Mary in a Bathtub, only different.
1186	I'm going to write a $50 check to charity (juvenille diabetes) if that's ok with you.
1186	Kay
1187	I left a check in the top drawer (the one with the key) Kay
1188	Kathleen will be bringing it to you, if she hasn't all ready.
1188	Kay
1189	Here are the form exhibits, as we discussed: Kay
1190	Here's my little bit of info: GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine contracts.
1190	I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our details.
1190	I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but have not received it yet.
1190	ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it, but haven't connected.
1190	The contract is more straight forward, so problems are not expected.
1190	Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been prepared.
1190	Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment?
1190	Sheila may have someone she wants to work on it.
1190	If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the GE contracts.
1190	Austin - this is Stuart's project.
1190	Kay
1191	Suzanne, Please call (not email - he doesnt check it) Paul Pipitone (Andrews & Kurth) and see if he is available for a meeting (or conference call) to discuss the GE facility agreement sometime tomorrow - either am or after 300.
1191	Thanks, Kay
1192	Gregg, Sorry, I thought Suzanne had confirmed it.
1192	We are on for 330.
1192	I can call you.
1192	Kay
1193	At 330 please get Sarah and Heather Brown (Bracewell) on the phone for me, then I'll get Gregg.
1193	Thanks,
1194	Hi John, Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.

1194	Kay
1195	I don't remember this one.
1195	Kay
1196	Rusty, You are going to have to refresh my recollection as to this piece of land.
1196	Kathleen, could you please get with Rusty or Fred to see what's up.
1196	Thanks, Kay
1197	Let me tell, that is one 225 pound pitiful soul when he is sick.
1197	He has a head cold, so he is going home to go to bed.
1197	He will sigh and moan, and carry on like you wouldn't believe.
1197	He will be incapable of discussing anything other than how he feels.
1198	Is the October 13, rev 3 the final version?
1198	Kay
1199	A call works.
1199	It will be the Enron commercial lead (Ben Jacoby), Stuart Zisman, the GE commercial lead and the GE lawyer.
1199	It is about the contract he prepared (although now I wonder).
1199	If he prefers to have whoever will be doing the drafting, that's fine, too.
1199	Kay
1200	Gentlemen: Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.
1200	It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.
1200	It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me otherwise.
1200	I'll get back to you with the location.
1200	Kay
1201	Per my voice mail
1202	Please print the blackline for me.
1202	Thanks, Kay
1203	CST.
1203	That was right, right?
1203	I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning the revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection (objecting=volunteering to turning the next draft!) Kay
1204	Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM ?Mail this article to a friend (Corrected 1:59 pm) NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said.
1204	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron said.
1204	The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator projects with the California Independent System Operator.
1204	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour.
1204	The preliminary order could become a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from the public, or it could be modified.
1204	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer.
1204	The ISO plans to pay a total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for installing the new generators, which the power companies will own.
1204	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the generators for any electricity the new generators produce.
1204	Pricing for the power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered "There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap," Enron's Mark Palmer said.
1204	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects.
1204	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were three times what they were a year earlier.
1204	To meet the state's rising demand for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights on.

1205	I see Ben keeps calling me.
1205	Any idea what's up?
1205	I probably have another 30 minutes on this call.
1206	Probably wouldn't hurt.
1206	Tell him I'll be on for another hour.
1206	Thanks, Kay
1207	Your list is very close to mine.
1207	I'm making a list as I go back through the draft, so I'll update when I get through.
1207	Kay
1208	Hi Dale, We are meeting with GE tomorrow to talk about this.
1208	Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.
1208	Ditto on the ABB agreement which I forwarded not too long ago.
1208	Kay
1209	Do you have Thomas Heatherington's card (Bracewell guy)?
1209	Thanks, Kay
1210	This looks like it belongs in the specs.
1210	What do you think?
1210	Kay
1211	Hi Scott, I have these questions: What do we mean by configuration?
1211	We are telling them that we will give them the configuration by date x, but I'm not sure what we mean.
1211	What was decided on spare parts, if anything?
1211	I know it is repetitive, but could you email me a basic timeline of what you see as the key dates for site designation, shipping, anything else you can think of?
1211	I've started a timeline but would like to cross check.
1211	I was hoping to have it done before noon, but the 930 conference call will impact that.
1211	I have a meeting this afternoon from 230 until 500 or so, so I'm trying to get done before then.
1211	Thanks, Kay
1212	Please call Ben Jacoby and see if we can push our meeting to 230.
1212	Please advise Stuart that I'm planning to meet with Ben at 230, and invite him to join.
1212	Thanks, Kay
1213	Sheila went to these.
1213	I believe they cover the activities related to the development of the various site.
1213	I'm on a conference call or I would have called.
1213	Kay
1214	You don't need to re-number the definitions yet.
1214	Thanks, Kay
1215	Perfect.
1216	Sounds right.
1216	I'll tell Barbara.
1217	I need to do the unthinkable and read something else for a little while, so I thought I would send this to you as is.
1217	Let me know if you want it redlined against something, and if so, which version.
1217	Kay
1218	Please tell Paul it will probaby be 315 or so before we call, and confirm the correct number.
1218	Also, please let Lisa Bills know where we will be meeting, as she is planning on coming late to the meeting.
1218	Thanks, Kay
1219	Hi there.
1219	Hope all is well.
1219	FuelCell files $250 million offering By Matt Andrejczak, CBS.MarketWatch.com Last Update: 4:50 PM ET Nov 1, 2000 Latest headlines WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- FuelCell Energy filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday to periodically sell up to $250 million of debt and equity securities.
1219	Danbury, Conn.-based FuelCell (FCEL: news, msgs) said it would the proceeds to fund expansion of its manufacturing facilities and for working capital.
1219	Under a shelf offering, a company may sell debt, common or preferred stock from time to time, at varying prices and in separate transactions.

1219	Shares of FuelCell closed down $4.44 to $72.13 in Wednesday trading.
1219	?
1219	Matt Andrejczak is a reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.
1220	The word Suzanne heard is that they are moving everyone to the Enron Corp book in the somewhat near future.
1220	They moved me there from EI when I transferred last March.
1220	Kay
1221	Kent, There isn't anything attached that I can open.
1221	Am I doing something wrong?
1221	Kay
1222	I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good.
1223	You have to admire the initiative!
1223	Suzanne is adding your changes to the purchase agreement now.
1223	Kay
1224	Hi there, I'm attaching the latest version of the purchase agreement.
1224	I will prepare a compared version in the am if you will tell me which version you want it compared against.
1224	Talk to you soon, Kay
1225	Greetings, Ok, I know I must be doing something wrong.
1225	I either get a "wrong SAP number", or I end up on the HRonline website, with no Clickathomepilot options.
1225	I'm using my HRonline password.
1225	Any suggestions?

1226	Off the internet: FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM ?Mail this article to a friend New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications.
1226	The first contract is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio.
1226	The second contract, for $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using methanol for fuel.
1226	It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA.
1226	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere.
1226	Costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell Energy.
1226	As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free.
1226	"The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades," said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL.
1226	"This application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."
1226	According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations.
1226	A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources.
1226	The U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity.
1226	At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion market.
1226	"The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in benefits for all concerned," said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of FuelCell Energy.
1226	"Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users."
1226	Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites.
1226	The Coast Guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as lighthouses, structures, and buoys.
1226	Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation.
1226	The methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources.
1226	"This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment", said Walt Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center.
1226	"We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems."
1226	"In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells," said Leitman.
1226	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through combustion.
1226	This method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process.
1226	About FuelCell Energy, Inc. FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power generation.
1226	The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel.
1226	This results in a product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation.
1226	FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW..
1226	The Company has been developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL).
1226	The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and industrial applications.
1227	I accept the terms & conditions of this Pilot Participation Agreement.
1227	Kay Mann
1228	I just completed a lengthy call with A & K concerning the form facility agreement.
1228	A revised draft should be out mid-day today.
1228	I have once again called ABB, but haven't heard back from them yet.
1228	Kay
1229	I think it is a great day to work!
1230	I asked Paige what she was doing for Thanksgiving....
1231	I could nap in this weather.
1231	Maybe I'll leave early.
1232	Hi Jordan, I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.
1232	Peoples and Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.
1232	Each of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.
1232	It is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah Wesner has been involved in the process.
1232	Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to run this transaction through your group for blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.
1232	I can give additional information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.
1232	Thanks, Kay
1233	I'll send the blackline when I get it.
1233	Kay
1234	Any word?
1235	I'll have to check.
1235	I haven't heard of any problems.
1235	Kay
1236	As requested, I went the abbreviated route.
1236	Kay
1237	Please print this monster.
1237	Kay
1238	Have you noticed that almost all my documents are monsters?
1238	Kay
1239	Hi Kent, I believe this to be blacklined against the original document.
1239	Please note there are some comments/questions included.
1239	Talk to you soon, Kay
1240	Gregg, Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.
1240	Since Corp will be loaning the money, I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, so to speak).
1240	Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate is priceless.
1240	Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...
1240	Strange choice for a company name!!!
1240	Kay
1241	I got a draft of the CA from her this am.
1241	I'll give it a look and get it to you today.
1242	Please confirm the version of the document which was the basis of the compared version.
1242	Thank you, Kay
1243	When I run a CompareRite redline I get a different number of changes, so I was unclear as to the compared documents.
1243	Kay
1244	Scott, I ran a redline comparing the version we sent last Thursday and their new clean draft.
1244	It shows a different number of changes.
1244	Here's the Enron redline: Too much paper!
1244	Kay
1245	Hi Gregg, FYI.
1245	Kay
1246	I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.
1246	I'm glad it worked out ok.
1246	I tried calling last night but got a busy signal.
1246	When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't know they were going to send a request for $.
1246	Sorry about that!
1246	We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm about to give up on figuring it out.
1246	She doesn't know if she can get a ticket to the game yet.
1246	I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've gotten.
1246	Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?
1246	We'll probably figure things out in the next few days.
1246	We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans.
1246	I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go again!
1246	Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.
1246	Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.
1246	I can sure see along way today.
1246	Love, Kay
1247	Joel, Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the documents.
1247	Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.
1247	As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as possible.
1247	If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.
1247	Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate most of their legal issues now.
1247	I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.
1247	Hope this helps.
1247	Kay
1248	Sheila, I should have sent this to you as well.
1248	Kay
1249	I'm just about half done with the chart, so I thought I would share it with you for comment.
1250	This doesn't have the latest from what you sent.
1251	Kathleen, Please change the first paragraph as follows: ENA is prepared to furnish you with certain risk analysis information whichis either confidential, proprietary or generally not available to the publi("Confidential Information") in connection with ENA,s disclosure to PERCand/or enovate for its performing independent risk analysis relating to ofthe portfolio of enovate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company.
1251	Sucinformation may include (but not be limited to) and for PERC,s evaluation of daily curves such as price, basis, index, volitility and interest rates asthey relate to the operations of enovate, L.L.C.
1251	As a condition to furnishing Confidential Information, PERC and ENA each agree to the following: As for the paragraph 7, I've asked Gregg if the disclosures will be one timor ongoing.
1251	If the disclosures will be ongoing, we may want to rethink theeffective period to make it two years from the last disclosure.
1251	Gregg also needs a resoluting regarding signing authority, but I've left hia voice mail asking for more information.
1251	Thanks, Kay
1252	Please print the attached on letterhead.
1252	I'm leaving for Connecticut shortly, and will be back in the office on Thursday (or so I exepct).
1252	Please handle the following Call David Runnels at A & K and tell him thanks, but I can't use the opera tickets this weekend.
1252	Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch tomorrow.
1252	Thanks, Kay
1253	Please call him.
1254	Latest version.
1255	I don't have it.
1256	She's making them now.
1256	The trip just came up 30 minutes ago.
1257	Here's a redraft of one letter, second to follow:
1258	Ross, The only thought I have with respect to this request would be that it should not apply if FCEL has failed to comply with its warranty obligations, or has declined to service the modules after the warranty period has expired.
1258	Kay
1259	Lou, Did someone do a PUHCA analysis in connection with the Peoples/Enron LLC formation?
1259	Kay
1260	Joel, I didn't work on the deal, so I'll have to check around the Legal Dept. Kay
1261	Hi Gregg, I'll check around here to see what I can find out, but I thought I'd ask you if you know the answer.
1261	I'll also check with B& P. Is Sarah off of this?
1261	I hope I didn't open a can of worms.
1261	Kay
1262	Hi guys, Was there a PUHCA analysis done?
1262	Thanks, Kay
1263	Hi Kathleen, I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.
1263	As you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben.
1263	I'll check with her.
1263	do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?
1263	If not, you can get a copy of my copy.
1263	It is not a standard agreement.
1263	On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing.
1263	I don't have the CA in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to sign a CA as well?
1263	It is a good question.
1263	Ta ta for now, Kay
1264	I'm HERE!!!
1264	How about the reorg?
1264	Mark H looks like he came out great.
1264	Kay
1265	Could you please print this, and put in a big binder?
1265	Thanks, Kay
1266	Looks good to me.
1267	Here's the agreement I would like to get in front of Mike.
1267	Thanks, Kay
1268	Please print the black line and put with the binder you are building.
1269	Another for the book.
1269	Thanks, Kay
1270	Any practice area preference?
1271	Attached are two letter our commercial lead on the salt soaked unti wants to send.
1271	Kay
1272	Ben, As a retired trial lawyer, I prefer saying less whether than more.
1272	I'll bring the letters down and we can discuss specifics.
1273	Jeff, I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume along.
1273	I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly.
1273	He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied transactional background.
1273	As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.
1273	EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to ENA (or EA, whatever we are called).
1273	He discussed this with Vicky, so she is aware that he is checking out opportunities here.
1273	Thanks, Kay
1274	I thrive on pressure.
1274	My birthday is January 11th.
1274	Is that close to her due date?
1274	Kay
1275	Hi Guys, We don't expect to deal with the facility agreement until around 130, so there isn't a need for Lee to listen to the rest unless he wants to.
1275	Lee, you are more than welcome to come in person, in which case I can give you some exectued change orders.
1275	Kay
1276	Oh well.
1276	Jeff is in London, but will be here on Monday.
1276	Kay
1277	I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.
1277	This week I stayed at 52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison.
1277	Madison is close to 5th.
1277	I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.
1277	The weather is beautiful here.
1277	Hope it lasts a couple of days.
1277	Neil loves his pig.
1277	I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.
1277	Have a great day!
1277	Love, Kay
1278	De nada.
1279	Due to the sensitivity of the information, we'll be specific.
1279	Also, should this be addressed to Bill or Curtis, or someone else?
1279	Kay
1280	I know the feeling.
1281	Please call Paul Pipitone (Houston) and Peter Thompson (he's in DC) and ask them to call in at 130.
1281	I'm not sure Paul will be joining us, but Peter has confirmed.
1281	If we are delayed we'll let them know.
1281	How long did you reserved the line?
1281	I can see the call going until 330.
1281	Kay
1282	As usual, the lawyers are the last to know.
1282	Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days.
1282	Please review the attached and give me a call.
1282	Thanks, Kay
1283	Thanks for the info.
1283	I'll give it a look.
1283	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1284	Jackie, Would it be possible for you to mark up the list of comments, highlighting which are outstanding?
1284	Marked by hand and faxed would be great.
1284	Thanks, Kay
1285	I just opened it.
1285	It came in last night.
1286	I wasn't sure from your email if you wanted to review it now, or wait until Jackie and I sort through some things.
1286	Kay
1287	Here's a rough draft of a different approach to assignment.
1287	Do you think it fits with the possible structures?
1287	Kay
1288	Hi Mike, Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.
1288	I would have sent this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.
1288	Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them contractually allocated to various projects.
1288	Please give me a call or have Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.
1288	Thanks, Kay
1289	Scott, As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's group, although it is based on language they have seen before.
1289	It was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.
1289	We can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured, etc. I am happy to access the resources in their group, however.
1289	FCE hasn't seen any of this language.
1289	It was something I pulled together for you to look at.
1289	As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is too broad.
1289	In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent.
1289	Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff: the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing facilities, etc. If they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something peculiar in Conn. law.
1289	They only need assignment language for an asset sale.
1289	Kay
1290	Gentlemen, Attached are GE's comments which I just received.
1290	They are concerned that we tried to improve the contract.
1290	Oh well.
1290	I hope to get this resolved today so we can wrap it up early next week.
1290	Talk to you soon, Kay
1291	I can assure you that no improvement in the relative risk allocation was intended.
1291	They pointed out what appeared to be some disconnects, and in some cases I ok'd them putting the suggestions in for discussions purposes.
1291	I wasn't trying to play games.
1291	Talk to you soon, Kay
1292	As I fix I was going to offer to let GE pick up 1/2 their bill....
1292	Kay
1293	Hi Mark, I thought I was in my "final" office.
1293	Where am I moving?
1293	Kay
1294	FYI, I expect to be on vacation that week.
1294	Kay
1295	Hi Jeff and Barbara, I would really like to stay where I am, if possible.
1295	I like being close to Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall.
1295	Thanks, Kay
1296	We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the break out contract.
1296	We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be close to final as far as the form goes.
1296	I have also asked A & K to prepare a memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the document.
1296	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1296	Kay
1297	Barbara has asked that I submit a weekly report about what I'm working on.
1297	I haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket items: Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.
1297	Enron owns equity and holds warrants for Fuel Cell stock.
1297	We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the benefit of the warrants.
1297	The commercial team is working on a deal to place 50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.
1297	I have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently completed the LOI with CRRA.
1297	We need to move to more definitive docs with CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete.
1297	The decision about whether the state will fund the project is expected in December.
1297	This deal is likely to continue to take up a large amount of my time, and requires a fair amount of travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.
1297	This transaction is on Dave D and Janet D's radar screen, and Mark is familiar with it.
1297	The potential upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.
1297	Turbopark.
1297	Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects.
1297	Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.
1297	This requires a series of contracts with GE (at least 6) which I am working on.
1297	We also have to move transformers into this facility, so I have been in contact with ABB concerning same.
1297	GE general.
1297	ENA is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with GE.
1297	I've been working with Sheila on this one.
1297	We are committed to finish this project by the end of this year.
1297	Westinghouse warranty issues.
1297	ENA has two significant disputes wiht Westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines.
1297	I'm riding herd on resolving the issues.
1297	VEPCO.
1297	We were attempting to negotiate a PPA with Virginia Power, but ran into some problems, so it won't close this year.
1297	Theres' some miscellaneous follow up work to do.
1297	Illinois development.
1297	I'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power plant sites in Illinois.
1297	Enron/Peoples joint venture.
1297	I'm working with the Enron commercial team in certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running.
1297	This gives at least an overview of what I'm spending most of my time on.
1298	If it says Austin, it must be yours....
1298	Kay
1299	1100 is just fine.
1299	We are all so dependent on our computers, I can hardly remember what we did in the "old days".
1299	Kay
1300	so please let me know if you can't get them printed soon.
1300	Thanks, Kay
1301	Hi Mitch, My suggested changes are highlighted.
1301	Please let me know what else I can do.
1301	Kay
1302	Hi John, Thanks for your call the other day.
1302	The team is currently focused on getting the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.
1302	Also, we have had some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the equipment.
1302	I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.
1302	It may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.
1302	The next big item will be the project development agreement.
1302	The tax credit monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.
1302	Again, thanks for checking in. Kay
1303	Here's how it is shaping up: We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.
1303	That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation.
1303	Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out tomorrow.
1303	Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate open.
1303	We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.
1303	There is a $20 consulting fee.
1303	This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, so this isn't too bad.
1303	I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it.
1303	The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.
1303	If we have a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a reservation at the kennel.
1303	Do we have one yet?
1303	I would say we might want one Fri and Sat night.
1303	Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.
1303	We should be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be home on Tuesday.
1303	Kay
1304	Hi Peter, Do you have a new ETA yet?
1304	I need to manage expectations on this end.
1304	Thanks, Kay
1305	Hi Geneva, The instruction sheet mentions a gift bag.
1305	Do I pick this up at drop off?
1305	Thanks, Kay
1306	Peter, If I can get the clean version, I'm happy to run a blackline here.
1306	Maybe getting out of your system would help!
1306	Thanks, Kay
1307	Blackline to follow.
1307	Kay
1308	Here's the blacklined version.
1308	Kay
1309	Most recent (but not final) Turbopark/GE contract.
1309	More to come...
1309	Kay
1310	Kay
1311	Print job.
1312	Greetings, I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.
1312	The goal is to develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the same points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.
1312	Sheila has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might find interesting and/or helpful.
1312	You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.
1312	Please let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.
1312	Thank you, Kay
1313	Thanks!
1314	Not today.
1314	Let's get feedback from GE today.
1314	Plus, the document has a lot of formatting glitches and it looks terrible.
1314	Does that work?
1314	Kay
1315	Hi Peter, When do you think we will have a pretty compared document?
1315	Thanks, Kay
1316	Scott, Here are letters to Westinghouse, as revised to reflect our comments.
1316	Kay
1317	I got lots done Saturday, but I can't remember what!
1317	You know how that goes.
1317	I bought a few Christmas presents, which felt good.
1317	I went to the grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing.
1317	That felt decadent.
1317	We didn't get hit too badly.
1317	Jack ran off during the worst part of the storm, scaring Neil and I horribly.
1317	A neighbor brought him back.
1317	We are having an electronic fence installed soon, so I hope that will help.
1317	I'm glad Michael got to see Uncle Bob.
1317	He was very impressed that his name was so close to Uncle Bobby's.
1317	I'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week.
1317	Sorry I can't get organized.
1317	Hope you are enjoying better weather today!
1317	Love, Kay
1318	I thought I had sent it out on Friday, but I had just saved it as a draft.
1318	Must have been the full moon.
1318	Kay
1319	Hi Heather, Jeff and Ozzie, The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are "extremely quiet".
1319	At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a facility is to their house.
1319	You may have determined that the noise level will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not reflect the expected noise level.
1319	Kay
1320	Need a sitter.
1320	I'm working on it!
1320	Any idea what time it starts?
1320	Kay
1321	A que hora?
1321	(what time?)
1322	Looks like they have a rats nest to figure out.
1323	Your suggestion is probably cheaper for Enron!
1324	FYI.
1325	Ok, I'm almost done forwarding emails.
1326	Heather, I think the clean one is ok to send to Bob Wright as is.
1326	Kay
1327	My recollection is that I gave it to Sheila around the time it came in, but I wouldn't swear to it.
1327	I'll check around here.
1327	Kay
1328	Peter, Do we have a good clean copy?
1328	If so, please re-send it to me, along with the best of blacklines.
1328	I have so many versions that I want to be clear that we are looking at the same documents.
1328	I also want to send the best of the best to GE, the Enron commercial team and the 4 other Enron lawyers who have received the defective versions.
1328	Thank you, Kay
1329	Here's the blackline I prepared, so you can see which looks better.
1329	Here it is as a Word file, just in case:
1330	Hi Kent, Hope this is helpful.
1330	Kay
1331	Hey Suz, Is Sheila still planning on having the GE call tomorrow?
1331	Thanks, Kay
1332	Hi Don, I'm not connecting this with anything on my "to do" list.
1332	Were you looking for someone else?
1332	Kay
1333	Gentlemen, Things are heating up, no pun intended.
1333	Therefore, it would be helpful if you would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.
1333	I know it is short, but I thrive on lists.
1333	I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that contract, without ever hooking up.
1333	I see that we will be facing a fire drill quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right financing vehicle.
1333	Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues for that document as well.
1333	Thanks, Kay
1334	FYI.
1335	okey dokey
1336	Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone.
1336	Here are the issues which need to be addressed to keep things moving: 1.
1336	Which transformers go where?
1336	2.
1336	How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?
1336	3.
1336	ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the contract allows for them to request payment security.
1336	Unless they are convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment security.
1336	The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except retainage) to facilitate the assignment.
1336	Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break out contracts closed.
1336	I'm available any time.
1336	Kay
1337	Are you going to get a Palm Pilot?
1338	Me again.
1338	I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.
1338	Could you make me a list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments from the text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version against the original master contract.
1338	Thank you, Kay
1339	Here's something to look at.
1339	I'm heading out soon for Master Whalley's birthday party at the Houstonian, but I'll check messages later today.
1339	Kay
1340	fyi.
1340	I'm printing.
1340	Kay
1341	Yes, such as the side letter, assignments, etc. That may be about it, but I don't trust my memory.
1341	Since there is so much to do in such a short time, lists help!
1341	Thanks, Kay
1342	I've found CompareRite to work with long documents.
1342	Plus, these documents started out as WordPerfect documents and were converted to Word, which I think creates problems with Word comparisons.
1342	I figure it is a Gates conspiracy...
1342	Kay
1343	I'll be calling in from out of the office, as will Sheila.
1344	Will Sheila be in the office today?
1345	Vizsla.
1345	I think they are also known as Hungarian pointers, but vizsla is the official AKC name.
1346	What an awful mess.
1347	Please print and fax the email and the attachment.
1347	I emailed Jeff and told him what I'm up to today, by the way.
1347	Kay
1348	Last time I checked I didn't have a fax from you.
1348	Did it go through?
1349	Here's my list of comments to the most recent draft.
1349	It is subject to internal review, but this gives you an idea.
1349	Could we have a telephone conference to knock out as many of these as possible?
1349	Thanks, Kay
1350	Hi Guys, This is just intended to be a list of issues to be addressed in each project specific contract - a "to do" list to finish each one.
1350	Kay
1351	This is the most current clean version of the GE breakout contract.
1351	You have also received a list of site specific references in the contract to assist in the preparation of the final document.
1351	I will contact Kent Shoemaker today to see how close we are on the form.
1351	It is my understanding that the lawyers involved in the projects will take the laboring oar once the form is ready to go.
1351	I'll let you know as soon as I hear something from GE.
1351	I am also trying to set up a meeting with ABB today or tomorrow.
1351	I will send you the current version of that contract as well, although we have not had any input from ABB on it yet.
1351	Kay
1352	FYI
1353	I agree.
1354	You are right on all points (especially the punting one!).
1354	You should have the list of specific "fill in the blank" stuff which I forwarded recently.
1354	Also, we had a discussion yesterday with GE on the form of the assignment/assumption agreement, so there shouldn't be anything required of you from that standpoint.
1354	I'm here today (wasn't yesterday) and will be happy to discuss it with you.
1354	Kay
1355	I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out contracts.
1355	I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm asking your help.
1355	I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on immediately.
1355	I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.
1355	Please let me know what you think.
1355	Kay
1356	I left Kent a message, suggesting that we start with COA, telling him ENA is the assignee.
1356	I'll let you know when I hear from him.
1356	Kay
1357	Are they still available?
1358	Please!
1359	Maybe it is Lisa Alfaro.
1359	If you prefer that an ENA lawyer handle it, I will volunteer.
1359	Your plate is more full than mine (I just ate at the luncheon, and I'm thinking in food metaphors.) Kay
1360	I guess the ESA lawyers have decided that this is not the time to outsource project work!
1360	We are to the point where we need Ben to help pull the technical and financial details together.
1360	I'll see what I can do to get his attention.
1360	Dan is still in the midst of his health issues, so he is fasting in anticipation of a 230 physical.
1360	Roger Balog brought a pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious, and one of clerks made the best collard greens I had ever had.
1360	I am miserable - which means I ate a lot more than greens and a piece of cheese cake.
1360	Kay
1361	Ben, Has the payment allocation chart been updated, and if so, could I get a copy?
1361	Thanks, Kay
1362	Hi guys, I thought it would be a good idea to come up with an plan of action to get the facility agreements closed out.
1362	From what I can tell here, the ESA and City of Austin deals are the most time sensitive.
1363	Sounds great to me.
1363	If we need Ben, it will need to be after noon eastern.
1363	If it is just us chickens anytime after 930 your time is good for me.
1363	Kay
1364	So?
1365	Hi John, Neil and I discussed this last night.
1365	I know we are interested in at least as many games as we had last year.
1365	I'll check with him and get back to you.
1365	Hope all is well.
1365	I haven't forgotten you!
1365	Kay
1366	I never would have guessed smoked oysters.
1366	I think I'm cooking for the 4 of us, plus Lena and any stray friends we find.
1366	We will probably come to Palacios on Saturday and spend the night, although I haven't discussed it with Mom yet.
1366	It is dreary here today, but in a nice way.
1366	I don't mind it too much, although by Sunday we may be stir crazy.
1366	We went to Michael's school on Wednesday, as his class was singing in chapel.
1366	Roger Clements was there, video cam in hand, doing the dad thing.
1366	He is a really big guy, much bigger than I thought.
1366	He looks like a football player.
1366	I see why Piazza didn't take a swing!
1366	I would say "break a leg" for Katie, but with your groups orthopedic problems, I hesitate to use the phrase!
1366	Love, Kay
1367	FYI.
1367	I believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout contracts - one for the City of Austin project, and one for the ESA project.
1367	I heard yesterday that they want the ESA contract by November 22, and the COA shortly thereafter.
1367	I expect to talk to Kent today about where we are on the form, and how to move forward to closure.
1367	Kay
1368	Looks like Lee is still in the loop.
1368	Kay
1369	Dale, What is your availability for a conference call with GE today?
1369	Kay
1370	fyi I'll send you the list of site specific references also.
1371	I'm in a conference call marathon, but I'll holler.
1371	You might just want to look at the sections referenced in the memo.
1371	Kay
1372	I haven't heard from GE yet today.
1372	Is your cell phone still the best way to contact you?
1373	How do we look for a conference call today?
1373	I'll be open in about an hour.
1373	Kay
1374	200 sounds good to me, and an hour should be sufficient.
1375	Per Rose's instructions.
1376	Dale said it was ok for me to send this to you.
1376	Kay
1377	Dale, Looking good so far.
1377	FYI.
1377	Kay
1378	Per our discussion.
1379	I just spoke with GE's counsel, and here's where we are: Change the following for the final draft: 1.80 delete "remaining" 10.2.1 take out the note Otherwise, GE had no comments.
1379	If you look on the spreadsheet I sent you earlier, it gives the unit numbers for each of the projects.
1379	You can figure out the guaranteed delivery dates by matching up the delivery dates from the contracts with the number.
1379	Also, please fix the use of purchase amount in 10.10.6 as suggested by Dale.
1379	The ESA deal has a change order associated with it (change order 3, attached below) and that CO is not reflected in the amounts to be paid.
1379	City of Austin has no change orders.
1379	The assignee is Enron South America.
1379	Thanks, Kay
1380	I tried to figure out how to print the whole thing, but failed.
1380	Did she figure out how to print the entire document?
1380	It really has a lot of information on it.
1380	Kay
1381	Lee, I'm in town next week (fishing a lot, though) and can be reached at the Kay
1382	Dale, Do you have the missing info?
1382	If not, I can send it to you.
1382	Kay
1383	I wanted to pass along the resume of Carlos Sole.
1383	Carlos and I worked together extensively at EECC.
1383	The "reorganization" of EECC has him moving to EES, but he would prefer to work here.
1383	He recently met with V. Sharp, and she understands that he wants to explore opportunities at EWS (I'm learning the new nomenclature).
1383	John Schwartzenburg understands this as well.
1383	I can recommend Carlos as a solid, intelligent, hard working lawyer.
1383	He's a great guy and I believe he would fit in well here.
1383	Thanks, Kay
1384	Hi, Got your voice mail, and it reminded me to sent this out.
1384	I don't know what is up with Jeff, so why wait to send this?
1384	Next comes Finance/M&A (Lance and Travis).
1384	I'm having lunch with Dan today - want to join us?
1384	We are going to Fox Diner.
1384	Kay
1385	Does this project have another name?
1385	I'm not familiar with Fountain Valley.
1385	Is this the same as PSCO?
1385	Kay
1386	I'm packing my office (yes, another move), so I'm generally avialable.
1386	Do you want to come over here around 1130, and we'll load up Dan and go.
1386	This will be a car trip, as FD is on Taft.
1387	Eric, here are some questions from Peter, the AK lawyer who is working on the contract.
1387	If you can respond by return email, Peter can keep this moving.
1387	1.
1387	Payee and Address for Invoices referenced in Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement 2.
1387	Section 6.7.1 Agreement reference [you might see if NEPCO has a reference] 3.
1387	For the recitals, what is the kW capacity of its plant and where is the plant located?
1387	4.
1387	According to the spreadsheet, the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for Units 9-11 was 10/30/00.
1387	The Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 12 is 11/30/00.
1387	Are these still the dates we are using?
1387	5.
1387	Please provide the serial numbers for Units 9-12 for Section 6.
1387	Please provide the names, addresses, etc. for Sections 25.1 and Thanks, Kay
1388	Hi Peter, 1.
1388	I don't think you need to do anything re Enron South America, as Rob Taylor is working on that.
1388	Were you asking about ENA?
1388	Delaware, 1400 Smith, Houston, 77002.
1388	2.
1388	I don't know who is preparing all the exhibits, as I'm waiting to hear from GE.
1388	Don't most of the exhibits just need to be copied?
1388	Is the list you gave me of the exhibits which need to be adapted the right place to look?
1388	3.
1388	No. The November payment has been made.
1388	You should get the other info by email from Eric Boyt.
1388	Thanks, Kay
1389	Dan just dumped me, so we can go any where you want.
1389	Do you have a preference?
1389	Kay
1390	Eric, these are already in my list that I sent you.
1390	Kay
1391	You'll like it.
1391	Do you want to meet by the garage?
1391	Kay
1392	Peter, Enron South America has nothing to do with COA.
1392	Enron North America is the assignee.
1392	As for payments, we can state that as of the signing of the agreements, all payments have been made.
1392	Sounds ok to me.
1392	Kay
1393	That Paul has a cloud over him.
1393	At least he has time to heal before baseball season.
1393	We are planning on spending Saturday night.
1393	Neil and I will stay at the B & Enjoy this great weather.
1393	I hear more rain is forecast for the weekend - hope they are wrong!
1393	Love, Kay
1394	Yes, and I agree.
1395	Fine by me.
1395	I'm supposed to be on vacation this week, but so far I haven't done a very good job of it!
1396	Please print.
1397	Please print and put with other stuff you just printed.
1397	Thanks
1398	His last day is tomorrow, not Wednesday.
1399	Hi Dale, There is another change order #1 which has been signed by ABB but not Enron, relating to the cancellation of a couple of transformers.
1399	I don't think it will be signed until next week.
1399	Can this change order be used as incentive to get ABB to the table on the breakout contract?
1399	I'm sending a copy of this to Kathleen Clark at EECC and Ben Jacoby, just to make sure there aren't any other change orders floating around.
1399	Ciao, Kay
1400	Is it reasonable to expect that Enron as well as Peoples will be involved in the preliminary meetings?

1402	Hey Suz, I'm off to walk my dog.
1402	I'm doing some stuff for Gregg Penman this am, but it isn't too bad.
1402	Paige will be home in time to go to lunch, and Michael wants her to come visit his school.
1402	Hope all is quiet.
1402	Is Dan OK?
1402	Ciao, Kay
1403	Peter, Go ahead and complete the draft with what you have, and transmit it to me with a list of questions which need to be answered to finish it.
1403	Thanks, Kay
1404	That reminds me that I had trouble reaching the pedals in your Bronco.
1405	Looks like the changes are relatively minor, but I feel better!
1406	Eric, Has this info been provided to Andrews and Kurth yet?
1406	It is needed to finish the facility agreement for the LM's, especially if you are trying to move these out of the existing contract on Monday.
1406	Thanks, Kay
1407	Any problem with this?
1407	Thanks, Kay
1408	I like the changes.
1408	I forwarded it to Bill to give him one last shot, but if we don't hear from him by noon, I would go with it.
1409	Good morning.
1409	So did I get moved?
1409	If so, please don't worry about unpacking.
1409	I actually prefer to do it myself anyway.
1409	I'm not checking voice mail, so if anyone calls I'm on vacation.
1409	Period.
1409	I've spoken to Sheila and Gregg Penman, and I'm taking care of what they need, but if I take on anything else, I might as well pack Michael up and come to the office today.
1409	Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.
1409	See you Monday!
1409	Kay
1410	This is the last email I have on the issue of consequentials/LOL.
1410	As I recall, we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the LOL for gross negligence, but it is an important issue for GE.
1410	Steve Swift wants to close out these issues.
1410	Are we ready, or do we need this for a swap for something?
1410	Kay
1411	The referenced section are primarily names and addresses for invoices and official notices.
1411	I'll pass the other info along.
1411	Thanks, Kay Enron Global Finance
1412	FYI, Kent Shoemaker (GE lawyer for LM's) is on vacation today, but I believe he will be back in the office next Monday.
1412	Kay
1413	FYI.
1414	Welcome back!!!!
1414	I was worried about you - tooooo much stress.
1414	Hope you can relax for at least 24 hours.
1415	What a great idea!
1415	Unfortunately, I bought her something already, which is highly unusual for me.
1415	Hope you are enjoying all your guys.
1415	Kay
1416	Hi!
1416	Matt is over until 300, Paige is off with Abbey, and I'm waiting for a conference call to start.
1416	How many places should I set at the table tomorrow?
1417	Kathleen, Is everything ok?
1417	I hope you are just having a nice day to yourself.
1417	What perfect weather!
1417	Kay
1418	I've heard that the turbines are supposed to be moved out of WestLB today.
1418	The contract with GE is not quite finished, although it is close.
1418	Kay
1419	FYI.
1419	I hope to have a conversation with GE today regarding finishing this document, including the exhibits.
1419	Kay
1420	Do the LM facility agreements for DevCo turbines need to contemplate ENA as an agent?
1420	Will it specifically be ENA, or an ENA subsidiary?
1420	Thanks, Kay
1421	Hi there, In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.
1421	In connection with this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning resolution of these matters.
1421	As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.
1421	Your comments would be appreciated.
1421	Kay
1422	I was out on vacation last week, so I just now received this.
1422	I'll give it a look.
1422	Kay
1423	Attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the LM6000's.
1423	This version was prepared for the Austin project and therefore lacks any DevCo specific references or requirements.
1423	Your input as to any lender requirements, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent, would be greatly appreciated.
1423	Thanks, Kay
1424	I love to look up this stuff...
1424	Kay PS It was great seeing you guys last week.
1425	Dear Turbine Torture Club Members: The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.
1425	The following items have been suggested for the agenda: Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for LM's and Frames, if possible.
1425	Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks, to GE soon.
1425	Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.
1425	In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be "moving" soon: City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO) LM's for the ESA project PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo, right?) I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.
1425	There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may be additional issues.
1425	Please advise.
1425	Thanks, Kay
1426	Rose, I suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can assign without consent.
1426	As of now commercial operation is not a defined term (I hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a different milestone.
1426	Thanks, Kay
1427	I just don't know how many questions they can come up with.
1427	I've quit predicting.
1427	Kay
1428	Hi Bob, I believe I gave on October 24, so I'll go again around Christmas.
1428	I'm glad that you've gotten some good news, and here's hoping for a much better 2001!
1428	Kay
1429	You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.
1429	Congratulations on the grandbaby.
1429	That's a BIG deal.
1429	My oldest "baby" is 20, a junior in college, and my Michael is 6.
1429	Every age is special.
1429	Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.
1429	He's in my thoughts, so I appreciate the info.
1429	Kay
1430	Hi Peter, Could I get a compared version of the most recent Austin draft against the original agreement?
1430	Thanks, Kay
1431	Sounds good.
1431	We went to Palacios last weekend.
1431	The water was very silty from the rain, and the tide was low.
1431	There were a few black drum, but not much else.
1431	We did find a stone crab, which was a first.
1431	Kay
1432	Hi Guys, I can't recall if you have made any revisions to the exhibits.
1432	Please advise (and resend) if you have.
1432	Thanks, Kay
1433	Here's a new one.
1433	Michael told me he was hungry (big surprise).
1433	I said, "Michael, do you want some turkey?"
1433	He said "No Mom, did you forget that I'm a vegetarian?"
1433	I had to leave the room as I couldn't keep from laughing!
1433	Kay
1434	I think he will just tell us that chicken nuggests are vegetables.
1435	Have a safe trip back!
1435	Love, Kay
1436	Please note.
1436	I called Cher.
1437	Hi there, Can you dig up Peter Thompson's number for me?
1437	He is in A & K's DC office.
1437	Kay
1438	Here's what I have for an electronic file of the exhibits.
1438	Kay
1439	Please print and fax this to Sheila.
1439	You don't need to print the attachmenThanks, Kay
1440	Hi Carol, I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.
1440	I've used two services, but only one that I can suggest.
1440	For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny Service, or something close to that.
1440	They seemed thorough, and found us a wonderful person.
1440	I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut case.
1440	Good luck, Kay
1441	Thanks.
1442	I think this is the most current version.
1442	Kay
1443	Will do.
1443	Kay
1444	Here's a somewhat refined version, with a reference to the financing reps.
1444	Do we want to be more specific?
1444	Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed assignee: (i) does not have a credit rating of [___] unless (a) the proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with a credit rating of [__], or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability under this Agreement until [appropriate milestone], or (c) is a party participating in or providing financing or financing structures, including, without limitation, structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing, including a special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop and/or construct the project for which Purchaser or Agent purchased the Equipment, if Purchaser or Agent has provided reasonably satisfactory representations concerning the sufficiency of the financing arrangement, or (d) final payment (except for the retention amount) has been made to Seller; (ii) is a direct competitor of Seller in the turbine manufacturing business, (iii) is an adverse party to Seller in any material litigation, or (iv) if purchasing the Equipment, such assignee is not purchasing such Equipment (or rights thereto) as part of a transaction in which Purchaser, Agent or their Affiliates is providing related goods and/or services to such assignee.
1445	I just love the law....
1446	The next step in the turbine challenge is getting a draft working for the ESA transaction.
1446	You will find the turbines referenced on the Excel chart as ESA- Brazil #6 and #2.
1446	I am forwarding the serial numbers for those turbines.
1446	Please get a draft going on this one - we want to close on Monday.
1446	Rob Taylor is working on this from the finance side.
1446	He should be faxing you some language which needs to be included concerning an agency arrangement.
1446	He may also have the names of the assignee and the agent.
1446	Thanks, Kay
1447	Hi Lee, Opps.
1447	I forgot to send this to you.
1447	Kay
1448	More complete info.
1449	Hi Eric, I had a computer malfunction and lost your email.
1449	Could you please resend it?
1449	Thanks, Kay
1450	Opps.
1450	When you wrote back earlier I thought you were responding to me and not Rose's email, so I made a couple of changes and sent it out to everyone.
1450	The Barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the plant (not construct), and I was unclear on the time frame when that had to occur.
1450	I'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we re-traded, and can back off of the changes.
1450	The insanity continues here.
1450	Kay
1451	Please send a reminder out to Mike Barnas, Kent Shoemaker, Steve Swift, Rose Ben Jacoby, Scott Dieball, and Sheila, and once again include the instructions (yeah, I know).
1451	thanks, Kay
1452	And Lisa Bills.
1453	Hi Scott, Do you want to get together a few minutes early tomorrow to discuss indemnity/LOL, etc?
1453	Kay
1454	Michael says that you and he will be putting up Christmas decorations this evening "straight away" "before nightfall" etc. Of course, it is a good thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining.
1454	I was thinking it would be fun to have a family outing this weekend instead of sitting around the house.
1454	Maybe Moody Gardens?
1454	That seems like a fun place to go.
1454	What do you think?
1455	Good morning, and FYI.
1455	Kay
1456	Here's the draft form I received this am.
1456	Look forward to talking to you later.
1456	Kay
1457	Peter (or Paul) Please call so that we can discuss.
1457	713 345 7566.
1457	Thanks, Kay
1458	Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.
1458	The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts.
1458	You do it their way.
1458	There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of loss, insurance, delivery.
1458	I haven't thought through it all, but these issues probably need to be considered.
1458	It may be best to work through GE on a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere.
1458	Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any problems or damage.
1458	I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed then.
1458	Good luck!
1458	Kay
1459	I'll have to ask Neil for Michael's SS#.
1459	I don't have it on me.
1459	I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties.
1459	I think one in on the 16th and the other on the 30th (stupid day for a party).
1459	Are those good days for you?
1459	I just can't get interested in going to the Enron parties - too many people.
1459	We could really stand some shopping time (bah humbug), also.
1459	Kay
1460	fyi.
1460	Please call ME.
1460	Kay
1461	Don't forget Mama and gettin' otta jail.
1462	This is from my daughter.
1463	The first of these two documents contains the key terms of the GE contract for the ESA deal.
1463	It was prepared by GE.
1463	Your comments would be appreciated.
1463	Kay
1464	Here's how the numbers are being handled in another LM deal.
1465	At the risk of sounding like a wimp, I may just go home after my hair apptment.
1465	I don't feel up to snuff, and I think it is my sinuses (check the weather).
1465	I can work from there just as well as I can from here, only in my Kay
1466	I think he needs meds, including Prozac or something like that.
1466	He is flat out having an anxiety attack.
1467	He needs to stay away from the scales.
1468	Poor Dan.
1468	He is making himself miserable.
1468	I'm glad he decided to go to the dinner.
1468	I bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues.
1469	Wow, I didn't know I could control anything!
1469	Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re stack extensions.
1469	I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.
1469	Is this what you are looking for?
1469	The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange for signature from GE.
1469	The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the next week, or be a change to the break out contract.
1469	I do not believe the cost has been included in the payment schedule.
1469	Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this.
1469	Thanks, Kay
1470	More info for your file and use.
1470	Kay
1471	Maybe we should consider going someplace for a couple of days, sans kids.
1472	I meant a shopping date, no Michael.
1473	Any place with a fire place!
1474	I haven't done anything.
1474	I'm just making suggestions.
1475	I've always thought it was my responsibility to let me supervisor know if I'm gone, not yours.
1476	I'm not usually a Galveston person, but it might be worth considering in December.
1476	Might be best with Michael, though, so we could go to Moody Gardens and the Strand.
1476	What I don't like about Galveston is the water (duh).
1476	The San Luis is set up for kids, and has a neat view.
1476	Guess I have itchy feet.
1476	I haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks!
1476	All I see at the house is responsibility, and we never do anything anyway.
1476	Any ideas?
1477	Hi guys, This is the "break out" contract for the LM's.
1477	This particular draft was prepared for the City of Austin project, but we also need a TurboPark version.
1477	Please advise of any comments you might have.
1477	Thanks, Kay
1478	Hi Mike, Here's a draft of the facility agreement for your review.
1478	Thanks, Kay PS I think I have a redline somewhere.
1478	I'll check.
1479	Attached is the first draft of the ESA facility agreement.
1479	which I believe is current through yesterday's discussion.
1479	I would appreciate it if you could forward this to the persons in Transaction Support and Tax who are working on this transaction.
1479	Thanks, Kay
1480	And now the exhibits.
1481	Out of habit I sent this to Lisa.
1482	More.
1483	Attached is a first draft of a letter agreement relating to the LM 6000/Coral transaction.
1483	Please let me know ASAP if you have any comments.
1483	Thanks, Kay
1484	print job
1485	ditto
1486	They moved it a while back.
1487	Thanks for offering your previous risk memo.
1487	I accept all offers of prior work product.
1488	Hi Carolyn, Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC: 1.
1488	Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the transformer as well as the turbine?
1488	2.
1488	Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the equipment, not just the sale.
1488	I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.
1488	3.
1488	Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a reference is fine).
1488	4.
1488	Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?
1488	If fact, please review the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss same.
1488	5.
1488	Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.
1488	We should specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed by a credit worthy entity.
1488	6.
1488	Timing of delivery of contract and funding - in discussing this matter with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.
1488	7.
1488	Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the nitty gritty of our financing structure.
1488	I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of where we are headed.
1488	Thanks, Kay
1489	As soon as I hit the "send" button I recalled another issue.
1489	Enron does not want the LLC used for anything other than the acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.
1489	Other development activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron has an ownership interest.
1489	I'm going to double check this, as it seems the LOI is fairly specific on this point.
1490	For the next step...
1491	Gentlemen, The ESA docs are being reviewed internally for financing and accounting issues.
1491	Thanks for turning the docs in such a timely manner.
1491	COA is on stand by, due to our need to focus on ESA and two new, identical contracts (remember, we have a lot of turbines!) The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe units 17 & 18.
1491	These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the base prices of each will be increased appropriately.
1491	We will pay 75% of the price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option.
1491	The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS: CA Energy Development I, LLC and CA Energy Development II, LLC.
1491	Use Ben Jacoby at 1400 Smith, Houston, 77002 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft.
1491	We don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions, so we will have to work with generics.
1491	We would like to have a draft yesterday, but seeing as that is impossible, please advise when you think it can be ready.
1491	Thanks again and again, Kay
1492	This is for future reference.
1493	A psych student could write a dissertation about that statement.
1494	Michelle, Carlos would be a great addition at ENA in any transactional capacity.
1494	I worked with him extensively (actually, I hired him), and he is terrific.
1494	Thanks, Kay
1495	I'm sending the stuff Carolyn did, and attaching the letter revised to specifically reference the January payment.
1495	I suspect that Coral may request language like Carolyn's version, as it tracts the language in the LOI.
1496	I can see if I can come up with a reason to go to New York if you want to go there.
1496	I know New Orleans has deals that time of year.
1496	There is also Guadalupe River Ranch, and some decent B & B's in Galveston.
1497	Team, I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously forwarded to Finance, Accounting and Tax.
1497	If anyone who didn't get it would like to get it, please let me know.
1497	Also, I am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this week is the final version from Enron's standpoint.
1497	Any information on that point would be appreciated.
1497	Thanks, Kay
1498	Ben Jacoby has asked that I forward the attached drafts of the letter agreement and LLC agreement.
1498	These forms relate to the "turbine only" LLC, but once we get the kinks worked out of this we can move forward with finishing the rest.
1498	These documents are subject to Enron internal review, but in the interest of time we are getting this out for comment.
1498	Thanks, Kay Mann Senior Counsel
1499	Here's a form:
1500	I'm going to leave Sheila a message and let her know about the meeting.
1500	Kay
1501	I think that him leaving word for Michele might be more palatable.
1502	Hi again, Have you been asked to prepare the promissory notes referenced in the letter agreement?
1502	If not, please put this on the list.
1502	Also, what else will need to be prepared to close this deal?
1502	I haven't heard for Coral yet, so I don't know if they bought in on closing early next week yet.
1502	Since funding is required they may balk.
1502	As soon as I know something I will let you know.
1502	Thanks again for your help, Kay
1503	Attached is a revised version of the consent to assignment.
1503	This version is specific to the ESA deal, but I'm told that the TurboPark version can be expected to be close to the same.
1503	Kent, I'm awaiting final Enron input on the facility agreement as well, and I will let you know as soon as I get it.
1503	Thanks, Kay
1504	Chris, We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will have to fly without it.
1504	I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for this equipment as of now.
1504	Here's co#1: Each of these units has one dual fuel option.
1504	The master list of serial numbers is in this document: We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial numbers.
1504	I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.
1504	I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January payment.
1504	Unit 17 to company 1 is fine.
1504	The maximum liability price (or whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel option amount.
1504	Good question on the retention.
1504	I guess we should set it up as if each is in a stand alone project.
1504	As far as I know they may be intending to put these at separate sites.
1504	I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.
1504	Thanks, Kay
1505	I will be happy to review change order #5, and present to GE for their review and approval.
1505	First, it needs to be prepared by someone involved with the project, and Finance needs to be notified that additional funding will be required, if they don't know already.
1505	As I mentioned in my email, there needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should be funded out of WestLB (prior to December 15) or will be funded through I faxed change order #2 to Al so that he has the form.
1505	If this will be funded through WestLB, the current contract value is $352,289,400.
1505	Here is the electronic form: Kay

1509	Hi there, No news here for me, but I thought you might enjoy looking at the second chart.
1509	Hope you have PowerPoint so you can open this!
1509	Kay
1510	Frank worked every Saturday when I was at HMRP.
1511	It needs to also go through Lisa Bills and Ben Jacoby.
1511	It really doesn't matter to me who handles GE signature.
1511	I'd like to get a copy just to stay current.
1511	Plus, it impacts the break out contract (payment schedule and scope).
1511	Kay
1512	Absolutely.
1512	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1513	Please calendar.
1513	Kay
1514	Sorry it took so long to get back to you.
1514	Today has been beyond frenetic.
1514	I agree with your comment #1.
1514	I expect they will ask us for a rep like the one in #2, but they still want to hear it from GE.
1514	Kay
1515	Hi Rob, We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then selling the equity.
1515	I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption agreement.
1515	Is this ok?
1515	Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?
1515	This is the same transaction I called you about this am.
1515	Any thoughts on the notice question?
1515	Thanks, Kay
1516	Coral wants some comfort from GE.
1516	This is their proposal.
1516	Kay
1517	How could resist being part of the Light Brigade?
1518	I really like this one.
1519	The word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance sheet.
1519	If the Coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted.
1519	Therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that the Coral transaction will close.
1519	The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor, and he thinks the agreement is fine.
1519	Kay
1520	Hi Guys, In a conversation with GE today, they indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to insert the performance values in the text of the document, and do away with the exhibit.
1520	Frankly, I like that approach also.
1520	Could you please make that revision and resend the document?
1520	Thanks, Kay
1521	Here's what went out this evening: Kay
1522	Still working it.
1522	Kay
1523	Team, Will ESAT still be the signatory to the contract as agent for the Brazilian Power Development Trust, or will the contract be directly between the Trust and GE?
1523	Thanks, Kay
1524	The security desk downstairs may know who he checked in to see.
1525	I know who can sign for EEPC and NEPCO.
1525	I tried looking up LJM2-Turbine and haven't located it.
1525	I'll try to track it down.
1525	I previously sent the letter to the lawyers I believed to be responsible for the entities, so they have some background.
1525	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1526	Hello.
1526	I would like to receive a brochure and room rates for 2001.
1526	I visited your website and it looks wonderful.
1526	Please send the info to Kay Mann, 29 Inverness Park Way, Houston, TX, 77055.
1526	Thanks, Kay
1527	Am I begging too much?
1527	Can you mail her package tomorrow?
1527	I meant to ask today, but I got home so late I didn't get things together.
1527	I put one of Michael's airplane pictures in there.
1527	If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.
1527	My mom would love to watch him as she wants him to be exposed to Fort Worth culture.
1527	(a better grade of bean dip).
1527	I'm very excited!!!!
1527	Love, Kay
1528	Seems like a good guess to start with.
1529	Just so we are all on the same page, this is the most recent draft of the ESA breakout contract in my files.
1529	Thanks, Kay
1530	Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok, and let's go for it.
1530	Jack to the doggie spa, Michael with Paige.
1531	The dates are the 26th-28th, so we would be back on the 29th.
1532	I haven't read this yet.
1533	This is all I've received on this today.
1534	I'll try to be home by 800 tonight so I can see my baby boy (and his hot daddy).
1534	High class hamburger sounds great.
1534	Love, Kay
1535	The only ABB change order I know about is the one that cancelled two transformers.
1535	It has been signed by ABB but not Enron, but it is agreed.
1535	It resulted in a cancellation charge of around $350,000, and obviously lowered the contract value.
1535	I'll get a copy and send it to you.
1535	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1536	I've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following changes: Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose, I paraphrased on this.
1536	Making the consent effective the later or signing or financing.
1536	I have ZERO pride in authorship.
1536	This is based on ESA, but I would think would apply to TP as well.
1536	I think we should get this to GE no later than 1000 am tomorrow if at all possible.
1536	Kay
1537	Please send out a reminder of the GE conference call to the following: Sheila Rose Lisa Scott Mike Barnas Kent shoemaker steve swift Ben jacoby We don't need a conference room this week.
1537	Thanks,
1538	This has sound.
1538	It is totally hilarious.
1539	Hi there.
1539	Could you send me the Word final of the master GE contract which was the basis for the subsequent facility agreements?
1539	I don't have it in Word- just WordPerfect.
1539	Thanks, Kay
1540	Mike hasn't sent the new assignment language.
1540	To my knowledge we had not discussed including it in this set of agreements, so he may have put it aside to work on the consent issues.
1540	Kay
1541	Good morning, We have made some revisions to the consent agreement.
1541	I did not redline the changes since we were looking at two different documents yesterday.
1541	We added language concerning material adverse event and the need for the financing to occur before the consent is effective.
1541	We could not include Paul's request concerning compelling the Owner to take action.
1541	Please call me (713 345 7566) or Rose (713 345 7726) with questions, or we can address it in our 130 CST phone call.
1541	Thanks, Kay
1542	Tonight will be LATE.
1542	It is a real rollercoaster.
1542	Love, Kay
1543	I'm going I'm going I'm going
1544	Thanks Peter.
1544	I'm actually looking for the Master Agreement, not the initial facility agreement.
1544	I know that Paul (or someone) had converted the original master agreement from WordPerfect to Word.
1544	I thought it would be handy to have the file.
1544	Thanks, Kay
1545	2.
1545	I believe SWPC further agreed that the assignment to the LLCs (and the subsequent transfer of equity) will not affect the terms of the contracts, including the warranties.
1545	Enron North America Corp.
1546	Thanks once again.
1546	I really appreciate your responsiveness.
1546	In a recent email you mentioned that you had a couple more changes to the ESA agreement, then we would be good to go.
1546	Can I get that by the end of the day?
1546	Many thanks!
1546	Kay
1547	You might want to check the payment terms.
1547	Remember this is only for one unit.
1548	Nicely done.
1548	Let it fly.
1549	FYI.
1550	Feed the dogs and kiss Michael.
1551	Chris, What information is needed for the exhibits to the Coral agreement?
1551	I don't remember.
1552	A taste of exhibits...
1553	Opps.
1553	Sorry about the confusion.
1553	We are selling the equity in CA to Coral, so I call it by that name.
1553	I'm looking for a list of what you need as referencedin the last line of this email.
1553	Hope that helps, Kay
1554	yes please
1555	Not unreasonably withholding consent and agreeing to the assignment are a bit different in my mind.
1555	Enron North America Corp.
1556	Sounds good to me.
1556	I don't see why the buyer would need the redacted information, other than curiosity.
1556	Enron North America Corp.
1557	I'm a strong believer in the team approach.
1557	None of us are as smart as all of us.
1557	Just left you a message - I'll turn back to finishing the letter before I leave.
1557	Kay
1558	You go girl.
1559	Please set up a GE conference call tomorrow at 300, and send an email inviting the the following: Lisa Bills Roseann Engeldorf Mike Barnas Steve Swift Kent Shoemaker Ben jacoby Lee johnson Sheila Thanks, Kay
1560	FYI.
1560	Can you make a call tomorrow at 100?
1560	Thanks, Kay
1561	Doesn't it feel good to delegate?
1562	FYI.
1563	Hi Mike, I haven't heard anything from Dave.
1563	Could I call him directly?
1563	Thanks, Kay
1564	I haven't looked at this yet, but I wanted to get it to you.
1564	I'll send the terms and conditions separately.
1564	Kay
1565	More Coral stuff I haven't read.
1566	Hi.
1566	You probably thought that I feel off the end of the world.
1566	Please take a look at this and give me a call.
1566	Thanks, Kay
1567	Scott, We have outside counsel looking at this.
1567	Thanks for the update.
1567	Kay
1568	There are discussions ongoing today.
1568	Karen Jones and Sheila are working it, and I haven't seen a recent draft.
1568	It should be ready by Friday.
1568	Kay
1569	Hi Mitch, Here's a darft of the revised letter.
1569	Please let me know what you think.
1569	Kay
1570	Gentlemen, I'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the breakout contracts.
1570	This letter is intended to preserve the lender requirements/accounting treatment from the WestLB agreement so long as the equipment is a part of the financing package.
1570	I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment, but we are still discussing Mike's version internally.
1570	Kent, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 CST.
1570	If you would like to discuss any of this in the am, please give me a call.
1570	Thanks, Kay
1571	Hi Mark, I need to addressee's name.
1571	Is NPC here?
1571	Thanks, Kay
1572	More dead trees...
1572	Kay
1573	Ta da
1574	What a great addition to my day.
1574	I'm getting close to being finished with the year end crises (I hope I hope I hope), and I'm looking forward to fuelcelling again.
1574	Thanks for being patient.
1574	See you tomorrow.
1574	Kay
1575	Neil, You have my proxy.
1575	Please let Anthony know what you think.
1575	Thanks, Kay Anthony, Venison would be tough to swallow without teeth.
1575	Kay
1576	Sorry, but due to three closings next week I can't be sure I won't be working this Saturday.
1576	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1577	Hi Al, My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for PSCO's break out contract.
1577	If it needs to be paid before year end (which it probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be paid out of TurboPark.
1577	This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at GE, and he is fine with it.
1577	Thanks, Kay
1578	Call me when you can.
1578	Kay
1579	Is this the same thing we were working on?
1579	Kay
1580	Let's discuss in person.
1580	Maybe we should ask Nancy her opinion as well.
1580	Kay
1581	Your thoughts?
1581	Kay
1582	I have to confess to having Illinois counsel involved.
1582	Kay
1583	Hi, I'm back.
1583	I'll give you the short version.
1583	I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent Mark and Vicky a note saying that you had paid your debt to society and are free to explore other options.
1583	Pretty good stuff.
1583	I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.
1583	Maybe I can lay some ground work.
1583	Kay
1584	Who is the labor lawyer that you guys use, and do they do plaintiff's work?
1584	I've had a couple of people ask me for referrals, and I don't know what to tell them.
1584	Thanks, Kay
1585	That's a lot of money for music.
1585	I wonder how they picked that as opposed to something else?
1585	I'm betting on a Taylor Symphony Hall - that's building money.
1586	Hi Scott, I'm tied up in a call and I don't know when I'll be out.
1586	Hopefully, things will lighten up soon.
1586	Kay
1587	Can we meet on this today?
1587	We need to reach resolution on some issues.
1587	Kay
1588	I'm not that wild about the pan sausage.
1588	Hamburger/italian/smoked are good.
1588	Kay
1589	Thanks.
1589	You guys are doing great.
1590	I saw you didn't get these.
1591	This is so nice.
1591	She is one of the lawyers at ENA.
1591	I feel very flattered that she invited me.
1591	Surely it isn't Amway!
1592	Please see if you can get a conference room for the 300 call.
1592	If there isn't one here, try 28 or 29.
1592	Thanks, Kay
1593	At the time I asked you to set it up I did not not the Joe Defner and Mike J Miller would be attending.
1594	I forwarded your email
1595	Please call Sheila and let her know we've made some progress with GE.
1595	Please see if there is time she wants to talk prior to 300 CST.
1595	Thanks, Kay
1596	Please tell Mike that I'm on a conference call, but can step out if he wants to come up.
1596	Obviously, I'm in my office.
1596	Please call him and tell him.
1597	Please call me about this when you can.
1598	I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is correct.
1598	If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the timing of the payments.
1598	At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I don't understand the 5% question.
1598	Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out contracts.
1598	Kay
1599	Any info?
1600	The first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the ESA Facility Agreement.
1600	Peter and/or Chris, could you please send/re-send the most recent version with a email stating any open issues, copying everyone on this email.
1600	We need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow, if at all possible.
1600	My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the January, 2000 payment.
1600	Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon.
1600	That's what happens when I'm not working from my list.
1600	Thanks, Kay
1601	This is going to be a late night, but if all goes well, it may be my last really late one (plus a little weekend work).
1601	We made some progress on some important stuff.
1601	Thanks, Kay
1602	Your call.
1602	Kay
1603	Hi guys, We can't sell the acceleration of the put to GE.
1603	Although off the record they will agree to it, for internal reasons they don't want to go on record with it.
1603	I'll catch up later.
1603	Kay
1604	The good news is they agreed to the current form of the acknowledgement letter, and will send us a letter stating they will sign the letter as is when we close on the facility agreement.
1604	I should have that tomorrow.
1604	You win a little, you lose a little.
1604	Kay
1605	Big whoop.
1606	I just cannot express how wonderful this sounds.
1606	Kay
1607	Hi again.
1607	Here is the consent to assignment which I believe is ready to go.
1607	The only changes I made was adding the requirement to give notice of the financing in 3 (f), and making the release of WestLB specific to these turbines (1(b)).
1607	I will bring signature pages tomorrow, and will forward the override letter this evening.
1607	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
1607	Thanks, Kay
1608	Here's the override letter for the ESA deal, with the new assignment language added: I want to point out that I included the language from the end of the section.
1609	I'm having typing problems.
1609	Notice how I spelled my name below.
1610	Here's the TurboPark consent.
1610	Please call me if you have any comments, as I want to send it out tonight.
1610	Sheila, I've spoken with Lee Johnson and John Schroeder, and they are lined up to sign at 900 tomorrow.
1610	Thanks, Kay PS this is consent to send 12 to TurboPark.
1610	This gives us room if the Coral deal doesn't happen in time.
1611	Here's the consent form for the equipment going into TurboPark.
1611	If you have any questions, please call me at home tomorrow (Friday) morning at 713 973 Thanks, Kay
1612	Ok sports fans, here's a Blue Dog (who named this one?) override letter.
1613	Ok, eagle eye, here's the override for your one train deal.
1614	I'm about done.
1614	How about you?
1615	I left around midnight last night.
1615	Not too bad if you don't have to do it often.
1615	I need to deal with ABB today.
1615	Hope you are sleeping!
1615	Kay
1616	Hi Ben, I got a call from Mike, and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number.
1616	He is very interested in the change order, of couse.
1616	Do I have the pay off number?
1616	What would be a good time to talk about the ABB payment allocation with Herman?
1616	I really want to put that issue to be, because I don't know if we can't put the stuff into TurboPark if we haven't taken care of it.
1616	I'm getting GE consent to put the Coral turbines into TurboPark, if necessary.
1616	That doesn't mean we have to, but I don't want to take any chances.
1616	How would you feel about not having the 1000 call and just having the noon call?
1616	That would give me time to talk to ABB, and we would be able to get the LLC agreement back to Coral.
1616	Thanks, Kay
1617	Good morning!
1617	I was wondering if Michael has settled down, or if he is having troubles attending.
1617	Thanks, Kay
1618	Today I'm going my GE's offices, so I'll be in late.
1618	If the deals I'm working on permit (3 are supposed to close next week), I would like to take as much time as possible off the week of and after Christmas.
1618	I won't take off all that time.
1618	Thanks, Kay
1619	I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.
1619	In the meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.
1619	This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.
1619	That's why it is first in line.
1619	We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).
1619	Also, I'm going to try to get ABB focused on doing their facility agreements.
1619	I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the turbines to confirm the payment terms.
1619	I hope to have it this am.
1619	What is your direct line?
1619	Kay
1620	Hi Rebecca, Is email from around 400 yesterday the final version of the payment schedule for the LM's?
1620	I need to get the facility agreements organized, and that information is obviously important.
1620	Thanks, Kay
1621	Please include these names on the distribution pthompson@akllp.com and Thanks!
1622	Thanks.
1622	I'm on my way to see Lee and John Schroeder, so you can reach me by my cell if you need to.
1622	Have fun at your daughter's school.
1622	How much fun is that!
1622	Kay
1623	Please send it on.
1624	You may have told me the answer to this already, but is there a spreadsheet for the transformers similar to what we have for the turbines?
1624	Thanks, Kay PS Herman and I are swapping voice mails about scheduling something today.
1624	Kay
1625	OK with you guys for me to add this?
1626	Is the procedure for taking something out of TurboPark about the same as Kay
1627	There may be a possible bust in 17.4..
1627	Specifically please look at how the math works on the refund due to termination.
1627	I think that the baseline should be the maximum liability amount, or whatever the proper term might be.
1627	Thanks, Kay
1628	I'm expecting John Schroeder from GE between 2-230.
1628	I really need to see him, so please watch for my phone so it doesn't go into voice mail.
1628	Thanks, Kay
1629	Ben, are you available at 9am on Monday re ABB?
1629	Thanks Kay
1630	While we were on the phone I sent GE an email about the issue.
1630	Kay
1631	I need: the current total contract amount and the payoff amount.
1632	George, I agree with your suggestion, and will make the request to GE.
1632	Kay
1633	There are 13 LM's resident at 16415 Jacinto Port Blvd.
1633	Houston Texas.
1633	I'm working on the transformers.
1633	Kay
1634	I left Dave Onuscheck a voice mail about the issues, and asked him to give me a call.
1635	I was going to suggest that we inbed some wiggle in the specifications, but no big deal.
1635	Kay
1636	A reminder: 900am Monday, my office.
1636	3882 We need the spread sheet on the transformer payments, please.
1636	Thanks, Kay
1637	We would like to have the conference call at 200 CST on Sunday.
1637	Any problems?
1637	If not, can you get the word out?
1637	My number at home is 713 973 6325.
1637	Kay
1638	We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).
1638	Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into TurboPark.
1638	I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the following week.
1638	FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding agreement to see them the turbines.
1638	If it would work to keep them in WestLB, that's great.
1638	However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of stress for you two.
1638	I'll manage Coral and Ben.
1638	Please advise.
1638	Ciao, Kay PS.
1638	Just in case you don't know, your efforts are very appreciated.
1638	Not just by me!
1639	Michael and I had a great time at the zoo.
1639	It was great to not watch the clock.
1639	Thanks, Kay
1640	ENA should sign them tomorrow.
1640	(I assume you are referring to the TurboPark set?)
1641	FYI.
1641	Most recent versions.
1641	Matt, sorry I missed you call.
1641	Roger, does signing the letter agreement cause any balance sheet problems?
1641	We anticipate closing a few days later.
1641	Kay
1642	I forwarded the email to GE and received no comment back.
1642	Kay
1643	Attached is the proposed change order with ABB.
1643	See you at 900am tomorrow (Monday) in my office.
1643	Thanks, Kay
1644	Will do.
1645	Gentlemen, I've revised paragraph 5 to reflect our discussion.
1645	Also, I made a change to paragraph 7 to include technical bulletins per Mitch's request which we did not discuss on our call.
1645	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
1645	Kay
1646	Sounds good.
1647	29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055
1648	I'm thinking GE said "no".
1649	Janette, I'm available.
1649	Kay
1650	I forgot to mention something yesterday.
1650	3 (g) states that within 10 days of closing we will provide Coral with the documents on Exhibit T. I personally do not know if we have all the documents listed.
1650	We need to either verify that we have these documents, or add some language about providing the ones in our possession.
1650	Thanks, Kay
1651	Hi John, I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.
1651	The contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.
1651	Could you have someone give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?
1651	One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.
1651	I assume that an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
1651	Can you have this verified?
1651	I only want the simplest of explanations.
1651	Thanks, Kay
1652	David, I believe you sent me some comments to the Fuel Cell equipment purchase contract.
1652	I now cannot locate those comments.
1652	Could you resend them?
1652	Thanks, Kay
1653	Here's a good place to start.
1653	I'm including a memo from Andrews & Kurth, our outside counsel who drafted the form.
1653	Thanks, Kay
1654	Mitch, The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during the conference call.
1654	They requested something along the lines of what is in the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language: SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to maintain an equity position in either of these companies.
1654	SWPC further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.
1654	How does this sound?
1654	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1655	I hope so, too.
1656	Re: ESA.
1656	Getting close.
1657	He asked me for the comments.
1658	This is really weird.
1658	I do not know why I can't find your email with your comments (I really think I saw them), unless it blew itself up (or operator error on my part).
1658	I will look for a hard copy.
1658	Kay
1659	I know how to get LJM's signature.
1659	Enron North America Corp.
1660	please print
1661	Resending since you didn't get it earlier.
1662	Dave, Here's the change order we would like to process today.
1662	Thanks, Kay
1663	I would line up CA next.
1663	Let me look over what Lee sent then I'll call (or you can call when you get free).
1663	How was the game?
1663	Thanks, Kay
1664	Hot of the press.
1664	This should be very close to the last version.
1664	Kay
1665	There is one completed unit going into TurboPark.
1665	The address is listed below.
1665	Kay
1666	$2.8 million.
1667	Team, I do not know if we have a full and complete set of documents, and if so, how long it will take to get these documents copied.
1667	Ben, can you address that issue?
1667	I don't want to assume that this is a slam dunk, as this is the kind of thing you can trip up on, especially since they are on a tight construction schedule.
1667	I'm not sure I understand his second comment.
1667	Kay
1668	Hi Ben, Have you talked to Janet about you being a director in the LLC's?
1668	Thanks, Kay
1669	Ben, I suggest that we get EECC (or whoever) to put the stuff together.
1669	You can't count on the right people being around after the 15th of December, and 10 days is nothing.
1669	Kay
1670	I circulated today's drafts to Finance, Tax, and Accounting, but have not yet heard back from them.
1670	I'll have to confirm when Enron will be ready to go forward.
1670	Kay
1671	Please print.
1672	The latest, greatest...
1673	Viola.
1674	Ben, It would seem to me that the retained amount on each transformer would be based on the total purchase price, including the option payments.
1674	Any reason to assume otherwise?
1674	Thanks, Kay
1675	Look what just came in.
1676	Any comments?
1677	Guess Neil better start moving the plants, too.
1678	Gentlemen, Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.
1678	I also believe we need the site specific stuff for this project.
1678	Kay
1679	Lee (and others), Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right?
1679	I do not know if I have an electronic version.
1679	If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless there is some reason to handle it otherwise.
1679	Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.
1679	Lee/Mike, do you have more copies of that document that we can attach?
1679	Kay
1680	You are in charge of your own destiny.
1680	Kay
1681	Michael is sick, so he's at home, and taking him to the doctor.
1681	More strep.
1681	My baby had 103 temperature last night.
1681	He was so pathetic.
1681	I will probably stay home tomorrow.
1681	Kay
1682	You are difficult to keep up with!
1683	The ground should be warm enough to keep anything from sticking.
1683	We got a half a cord of wood this weekend, and chili fixin's.
1683	YUM.
1684	It was a compliment!
1685	I'm thinking this is a good one to ignore.
1686	Hi Sheila, I'm not up on this part of the deal.
1687	I plan to be there.
1688	I didn't think about the champagne.
1688	Nice touch.
1688	I like Wick Fowler's - really easy, very tasty.
1688	I just may have to have some.
1688	I don't mind a few days of cold weather.
1688	It kills the fleas and the skeeters.
1689	If all else fails we will just make copies from the other agreement.
1690	We have deleted Exhibit U from the break out contracts.
1690	In other words, the version they received has been superceded.
1690	I'll have to see what I can figure out about where the old reference came from.
1691	Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question came from.
1691	Will we have an exhibit U?
1691	I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.
1691	Kay
1692	Hi Dave, I revised the change order to segregate the signature page.
1692	Thanks, Kay
1693	I changed the 2nd paragraph so that ABB is receiving money, not paying it.
1694	I corrected a typo under summary of charges (changed "by" to "to" Seller).
1694	Kay
1695	I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are plugging things into the text of the document.
1695	I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel guarantees, and where these will be reflected.
1695	Kay
1696	This shows the additional amount related to the Fountain Valley change order, formerly known as Change Order #6.
1696	Hope this helps.
1696	Kay
1697	Hi Suz, Please print the exhibits and fax to me it home.
1697	I thought you might enjoy this one.
1697	Kay
1698	I like that idea.
1698	Do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look like?
1698	I don't have the agreement with me (see below).
1698	At last word the Coral deal was sidelined.
1698	More to come.
1698	I'm at home with a sick child today.
1698	When you have a redlined version of the ESA stuff (redlined against the master), please email it to my assistant, Suzanne Adams, so she can print it and have it delivered to my house.
1698	If it is being printed by AK in Houston, please have it delivered to my house at 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055.
1698	Thanks, Kay
1699	I wasn't clear if the new B-1 is supposed to supplement or replace the old B-1.
1699	It is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent.
1699	That gets a bit more technical than what I'm capable of judging.
1699	You might want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there.
1699	Kay
1700	Suzanne, On my desk (on the window side) you will find a bound volume of a contract for 24 turbine generator sets (between GE and a bank with a long name).
1700	Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.
1700	Peter, could you please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.
1700	Pete, this will give you a full set of exhibits, since you don't have everything.
1700	Suz, you don't have to make a copy, as I believe that copy to be an extra.
1700	If we need a copy Pete can send us a copy later.
1700	Thanks, Kay
1701	Hi Dave, I wanted to check in to see how we are coming with the change order.
1701	Thanks, Kay
1702	The original GE West LB agreement, please.
1702	I suggest that you contact Lee Johnson via email, copying his lawyer Kent Shoemaker, asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee.
1702	Kay
1703	It is my understanding tha twelve LM 6000 turbines will go into E Next.
1703	The ESA and City of Austin LM's are the only ones not making the trip.
1703	Kay
1704	Lisa is a real hoot.
1704	Smart, tough as nails.
1704	She pulls no punches.
1704	Michael seems to feel better, but he has terrible circle under this eyes.
1704	I'm going to insist that the doctor give him 3 rounds of antibiotics.
1704	Being a boy, it isn't so bad.
1704	I just know that the strep is hiding in his sinuses, so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again.
1704	He slept until 800 today, and hour and a half later than usual.
1704	I think that must be his body healing.
1704	He is so excited that 6 flakes of snow might fall tonight.
1704	Paige wrote me today, said she is freezing (she's north of Austin).
1704	Kay
1705	Ta da.
1705	I thought this seemed like a good way to handle it.
1706	In fairness to Pete, we have him working on ALL the GE and ABB break out agreements at once.
1706	I'm going to be reviewing the ESA agreement, which is priority one because of financing requirements.
1706	This will be my final review of the "form" break out contract.
1706	We have not had a tax, insurance, accounting or finance review of the form for ENA, and with TurborPark closing this week it may be difficult to have completed within the next 24 hours.
1706	However, I don't expect any big issues, since it is so close to the original form.
1706	That being said, from the EPC contractor's standpoint, it is so close to being done that there shouldn't be any big issues.
1706	Just thought I'd mention all the pieces which are still coming together.
1706	Kay PS.
1706	Dale, does the LV Co Gen project involve a lease (a/k/a Enron getting off take)?
1707	I haven't heard anything so far, although I need to check my voice mail again.
1707	Kay
1708	Have I received a fax from ABB?
1709	I used to work at EECC, so I know that noone controls that group!
1709	There is a place in the agreement for a contract number.
1709	I think we ought to use the same contract number as before, but add a distinguishing number or letter- like FV or LVCG.
1709	How does that sound?
1709	Kay
1710	Dave Onuscheck left me a voice mail message that Frank had not yet reviewed the change order.
1710	Dave predicted it would be tomorrow am.
1710	That's getting close., but if it is done by then we probably won't be subjected to bodily harm.
1710	Kay
1711	I'm home today (Michael has strep again), but I will check email and you can call me at home.
1711	This is a good start!
1711	Bear with AR, and call me about Barbara.
1711	Sheila knows all she needs to know.
1712	We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.
1712	I hope Carolyn told you I called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.
1712	I'm guessing it is in a coma.
1712	I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which tells you something.
1712	Good time for Michael to be sick!
1712	Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.
1712	I think he is looking good for Mexico.
1712	You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can.
1712	By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.
1712	Did you hear from Rose on the HSR on TurboPark?
1712	We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.
1712	Are more available?
1712	I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.
1712	However, he is not a substitute for a pitcher.
1712	And how is Shane?
1712	Ciao, Kay
1713	Nope.
1713	Not mine.
1713	Two of the deals I've been working on died.
1713	I've had almost NO voice mails today, and a third as many emails.
1713	This is great.
1713	Maybe Neil and I will get to take our vacation after all!
1713	Kay
1714	Good.
1714	I'm ready to get at least one thing off the "to do" list.
1714	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1715	Can you say $100 stock price?
1716	Enron's Lay: "Categorically" Not Taking Job In Cabinet ?Email this article to a friend!
1716	?Printer-friendly version NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp's (ENE, news, msgs) current chief executivand chairman, Kenneth Lay, said Wednesday that he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential administration.

1717	Hi there, Just a note to say hello.
1717	Hello.
1717	Nit Noi sounds good to me tonight, if we don't eat out of the fridge.
1717	I'm having a craving for ethnic food.
1717	Love, Kay
1718	Good morning!
1718	I'm soliciting commitments for those wanting to go to the Nutcracker this year.
1718	I was thinking of trying to get tickets to a daytime performance.
1718	Any interest?
1718	The Sugar Plum Fairy
1719	FYI.
1720	I need to finish up an agreement and have it sent to a man by the name of John "Steinbow".
1720	Please call him and get the correct spelling of his name, his address and his fax number.
1720	If he (or his assistant) needs an explanation, I need the info to complete an agreement requested by Mark Bernstein.
1720	(Mark doesn't have the info, but doesn't want John to know he doesn't have it, so please don't call Mark to ask.) Thanks!
1720	Kay
1721	I had a really big lunch, even cake, so now eating out of the fridge (if at all) sounds ok.
1721	I got a really nice bottle of white wine from Andrews & Kurth.
1721	I put it by the window to cool off.
1721	I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S, and they are really good.
1721	However, K & S represents American Express.
1721	Keffer tells me that you used a guy at Bracewell that you liked, and that this person has now started their own firm.
1721	John drew a blank on the name, but will call me back with the name and number.
1721	Enron also likes Gibbs & Bruin, a litigation boutique in Houston.
1721	I believe the main contact's name is Robin Gibbs, but that is also the name of one of the Bee Gee's, so I could be wrong.
1721	Can you check the internet and see?
1721	If not, I will look in a minute.
1721	Love, Kay
1722	Yes.
1723	Yes, whichever.
1724	Hi Sheila, Did you ever come across the retention letter for PMRW reflecting a fee discount?
1724	Who would have that?
1724	Thanks, Kay
1725	These documents do not go to a third party purchaser.
1725	For instance, they do not get the change orders or correspondence relating ot all of the turbines.
1725	What needs to be pulled together are the technical documents, and any project type correspondence relating to the units being sold.
1725	Kay
1726	Very minor crisis.
1726	A penny for your thoughts...
1726	Kay
1727	The end is in sight!
1727	The break out contracts for the TurboPark LM's need to be finished up (not news to anyone).
1727	Each of these agreements will be between GE and E-Next Generation LLC (DevCo) and GE, unless the project company is already owned by DevCo.
1727	I suggest that each agreement reference be the same as the original, with an adder which makes it clear which project it belongs to (LVCG, FV, CISO1 and CISO2, for example).
1727	Al, your contract needs to be fixed up.
1727	Please contact Pete Thompson at AK in DC to get it rolling, if you haven't all ready.
1727	212 662 2780 Pete, the CA Development agreements should now be in the name of E-Next Generation LLC.
1727	For indentification purposes we can call the contracts CISO1 and CISO2.
1727	Thanks, Kay
1728	But I want you to be in the same group as me so we can work together again!
1729	OK.
1730	Can you get me a draft by Friday am?
1730	Thanks, Kay
1731	Good, I didn't want to ask Ed.
1731	He's very busy.
1731	So which curse word did you use?
1732	At Mark Bernstein's request I am forwarding a confidentiality agreement for your review.
1732	If it meets with your approval, please sign and fax back to me at 713-646-3491.
1732	If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a Thanks, Kay
1733	If you look under my kmann directory you will find a doc called westinghouseproposal to resolve issues on Enron Dec13 SWPC.
1733	Please print 4 originals on ENA letterhead.
1733	Thanks, Kay
1734	This language is different that what GE was told was requested before.
1734	I am more comfortable going back to GE with what was requested previously.
1734	Kay
1735	I need the phone number for Tom Heatherington (sp?) at Bracewell in Houston.
1735	Someone should have a directory.
1735	Kay
1736	It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC, don't you think?
1736	Kay
1737	This is the language in front of GE.
1737	I am optimistic that they will agree to this language.
1737	Kay
1738	Hi Dave, I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that) yesterday.
1738	The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled transformers ($400 off).
1738	With your permission I will substitute the correct version so ABB gets the money.
1738	Thanks, Kay
1739	Thought you might want to see it!
1739	Kay
1740	How's Hop-a-long?
1741	Dick, I'll forward you the copy of the contract on a separate email.
1741	I do not know if there are any additional insurance requirements specified by the lenders.
1741	Kay
1742	This letter is the last part of the contract:
1743	Oh my gosh that is so sweet!
1743	You caught me by surprise!
1744	fyi No action required.
1745	I've redlined the document against the previous version, but I don't think I picked up all the changes.
1745	In addition to the marked changes, there are these changes: D. third line, added "Original" before LM6000.
1745	This change is made throughout the document.
1745	Dated everything December 15; added "with respect to the Subject LM6000 Turbines after "Original Turbine Contract" throughout E. Added "and" between rights obligations in (iii) 2 (c) Added the Pastoria One-Train Turbine Contract in (ii) and (iii). Kay
1746	Congratulations.
1746	Bet labor was easier with your daughter.
1747	Hi Jim, I'm a lawyer in the Houston office, and I can give you a hand on the LM6000 transaction.
1747	My number is 713 345 7566.
1747	Could you send me the full name of the buyer, and we'll get the documents moving.
1747	Thanks, Kay
1748	I forgot about the happy hour.
1748	Where is it?
1748	I think that carpool could be pretty hectic, and since you and I haven't picked him up we don't know the drill.
1748	Picking him up an hour later might be a lot easier, and it doesn't bother him.
1748	Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities?
1748	Kay
1749	NRG Thermal and Millenium Energy are the parties.
1749	More specific names to come.
1750	Next week is Twas the Night Before Christmas.
1751	FYI: The champagne is flowing in New York, as TurboPark closed moments after GE agreed to revise their consent to meet WestLB's last request.
1751	Kay
1752	Per Rose's instructions.
1752	Kay
1753	Here's the latest...
1754	Please print.
1755	No. Why is Rebecca Walker telling Cheryl how to do this?
1756	Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and assumption agreement.
1756	The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.
1756	If there is a subsequent problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.
1756	I believe Enron has coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened until there is a certainty of closing.
1756	A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this transaction.
1756	We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark transaction.
1756	I'll make the changes.
1756	Hope this information is helpful.
1756	Kay
1757	My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the big stuff, even if it is your deal.
1757	Everything that she is working on now was one of her lawyers' deals, but "things just weren't getting done".
1757	She can be very unclear in what she expects from you.
1757	She is the ultimate micro-manager.
1757	She may hire the outside counsel on "your" deal, then tell you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.
1757	This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working closely with someone.
1757	Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and she is very, very nice.
1757	I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion.
1757	Kay PS.
1757	I thought this time I would give you full disclosure...
1758	Peter, the distribution list on this is different from the ESA deal (each contract has a different list - isn't that special?) I will forward it to the correct people.
1758	Lee Johnson and Kent Shoemaker get copies on all of them from GE's side.
1758	Thanks, Kay
1759	Hi Carolyn, In order to discourage Ben from continuing to direct outside counsel, please address as much correspondence as possible to me, or to me and him.
1759	Ben is terrible (and shameless) about violating Enron policy in this regard, and I don't know that I can stop him, but I do need your assistance in curbing him as much as possible.
1759	Thanks, Kay
1760	Michael has some stuff at school today that I would like to attend.
1760	I hope to leave here around 130.
1760	Kay
1761	How about a conference call at 1100 (Central) time?
1761	Kay
1762	Scott, I'm handling outside counsel, and spoke with him this week.
1762	I'm prepared to give legal advice on the issue.
1763	You'll be delighted to know that the call has moved to 1000 your time, noon central.
1763	Kay
1764	Things are getting better since TurboPark closed....
1765	In the TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.
1765	I know some (but not all) of it.
1765	I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.
1765	Maybe after the first of the year those group members who will be working on the power origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and accounting folks.
1765	Kay
1766	Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430, she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.
1766	Should I just leave him after gymnastics?
1766	I don't really want to come back the office, but I do want to go to Anne's.
1766	Hmmm.
1766	If Paige is home by 500, everything might work.
1767	Is it foggy or raining?
1767	I can't see anything out my window.
1768	Each project must have its own break out contract - that's the deal struck with GE and with the lenders.
1768	There will be no change orders to the master contract relating to specific projects.
1768	The break out contract must be entered into "as soon as practicable".
1768	This appproach has been taken with Austin, LV Co Gen, and ESA, and all of those contracts are just about finished.
1768	Please call me if you have any questions.
1768	Sheila also has a good understanding of the structure.
1768	Kay
1769	With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I believe to be the execution copy.
1769	Some things have been cleaned up, and Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.
1769	I'm going to start collecting signatures.
1769	Thanks, Kay
1770	The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain issues with Westinhouse relating to the Gleason and Wheatland projects.
1770	It also reflects that Enron isn't going to go after SWPC for a return of an option payment for the Blue Girl equipment.
1770	SWPC has requested that everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack.
1770	Please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature for your respective groups.
1770	I'll handle the LJM and ENA signatures.
1770	Please call if you have any questions.
1770	Kay
1771	Not exactly a "yes, we can close on Wednesday".
1772	I'm at home with a sick child today, but should be in the rest of the week.
1773	Lee, If this will be a dual fuel unit, it seems we should at least have a place holder guarantee, even if the details aren't included.
1773	Any problem with that approach?
1773	Kay
1774	I haven't tried yet.
1774	Things are ok.
1774	Michael is mad because I won't let him open a present.
1775	It won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact ABB's lawyer directly.
1775	His name is Dave Onuscheck, and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com.
1775	I'm home with a sick kid, and I don't have his telephone number with me.
1775	Peter Thompson has worked on the form.
1775	Do you have the draft with the memo of issues?
1775	Kay
1776	This may sound like a silly question, but why?
1776	Is this something Ben wants Matt doing?
1776	1-4 are all the CO's I know about.
1776	I'm out today, but we can discuss it tomorrow, and I can explain my point of view.
1776	Kay
1777	Looks ok to me.
1778	I've heard of some of the stuff.
1778	These items should be dealt with in the facility agreements for the individual projects.
1778	ABB has had a form of this agreement to comment on for a while, but we haven't heard anything.
1778	Hope this helps a little.
1778	Kay
1779	Hi Dave, I was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility agreement?
1779	We would like to make some progress on the form this week.
1779	In fact, you may hear (or have heard) directly from Dale Rasmussen, who is an Enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue.
1779	There are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in words and made a part of the individual facility agreements, or integrated as changes to these agreements.
1779	Thanks for your assistance, Kay
1780	After 2 parties, I'm getting party burn out.
1780	How bad is that?
1780	Kay
1781	Dale tells me that he really needs ABB to get with it.
1781	I sent an email (yet another) to ABB's lawyer asking for comments.
1781	Kay
1782	Michael is sick with some nasty virus.
1782	I'm a bit afraid to commit until he starts looking better.
1782	Poor kid had strep last week.
1782	Maybe he'll perk up by Thursday, but the doctor says it is a 10 day ordeal.
1782	I bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it.
1782	Kay
1783	I will be there!
1784	I'm in today.
1785	It is basically the same.
1786	Thanks, Kay
1787	Planning on it.
1787	Free food...
1788	I know Ben wants us to substitute the one signed by the other guy.
1788	I'll take care of it.
1789	Hey, they are making me crazy and I'm just reading your emails.
1789	Kay
1790	Thanks.
1790	I rsvp'd.
1791	Rose, FYI.
1791	I wasn't sure you had this.
1791	Kay
1792	Hi Heather, Hope you got situated in your new, swanky spot.
1792	Can't wait to see what you've done with it.
1792	I'm attaching Paige's resume, since she is interested in a summer internship.
1792	Any help you can give in directing it to the right person would be appreciated.
1792	Thanks, Kay
1793	Please send out an email reminding folks of the GE conference call tomorrow.
1793	Thanks, Kay Mike, Scott, Steve, Sheila, Rose, Ben, Kent, Lisa
1794	I will initial and handle signature.
1795	I believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding.
1795	Will closing and funding take place tomorrow, or will funding be a day later?
1795	Kay
1796	The assignment and assumption document has been signed by ENA and is being hand-delivered to Rose Engeldorf.
1796	Kay
1797	De nada.
1798	These are the current drafts of the proposed documents relating to the Intergen transaction.
1798	Kay
1799	Please print attachments.
1799	Thanks, Kay
1800	I suspect we will need a D & B on the Sweetgum entity being proposed by the new counterparty.
1801	We are waiting to hear.
1801	We have received documents from them, but no definitive word.
1801	Kay
1802	The name is in the draft agreements I forwarded.
1802	Maybe Fred can find out from the commercial people where the main office is located.
1803	Sounds good to me.
1804	FYI.
1805	900 am this am.
1805	For your info.
1805	Crazy day.
1806	Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000 turbine contract as it was moved into TurboPark.
1806	This letter highlights the 97-10 and lender requirements.
1806	I hope you find it useful.
1806	This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog equipment.
1806	This shows one approach to assignment under TurboPark.
1806	This is also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for assignment: Kay
1807	So true so true so true.
1808	Hi John, I took very poor notes from your phone call.
1808	Did you want to see a form of LOI?
1808	For what type of transaction?
1808	Thanks, Kay
1809	Did Sheila want Scott to participate?
1809	Looks like the call will be too late for him.
1810	I presume you haven't heard anything or else you would have said something.
1810	I haven't heard a word...
1811	Can't hurt!
1812	Boyd, I would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing.
1812	I also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses.
1812	Kay
1813	Latest docs.
1814	I don't believe Ben agreed to absolutely free transferablity on their part.
1814	To ponder.
1815	Here tis.
1816	Gentlemen, This is now back to being the CA Development I and II deal.
1816	Please change the name.
1816	Please send it to me and Lee Johnson tomorrow, if possible.
1816	Kay
1817	Lee Johnson would like to come in tomorrow or Friday to sign the Facility Agreement.
1817	Are we ready to go?
1817	He really wants to get this done before the holidays.
1817	Thanks, Kay
1818	Pete, Please call me after you have reviewed this.
1818	Kay
1819	Can someone in your office (or the Houston office) put together the execution copies of this agreement?
1819	We will need three originals.
1819	Thanks, Kay
1820	Per your request.
1821	Hi Matt, Here's the InterGen deal (formerly the Coral deal, now with new counterparty).
1821	We plan to meet with them tomorrow to see if we can wrap up the agreements.
1821	Any comments?
1821	Thanks, Kay
1822	I have a 130 closing at King & Spalding tomorrow.
1822	I also have a 1015 meeting with Lisa Bills, her office.
1822	thanks, Kay
1823	RE: Notice letter.
1823	We sent out a notice letter to GE last Friday regarding closing of a financing.
1823	Could you print me a hard copy so I can show you what changes need to be made?
1823	We need to send out another letter this week.
1823	Kay
1824	For the purposes of completing the facility agreement, we need the name/address of the contact person for invoices, etc. Thanks,
1825	Hi Carlos, Could you please get Dick to sign this?
1825	Can he sign for NEPCO also?
1825	Two original sigs is enough.
1825	Thanks, Kay
1826	I'm trying to clean up after Blue Girl.
1826	Can you tell me again who signs for LJM so that I can get signature?
1826	Who does their legal work?
1826	Thanks, Kay
1827	First installment of finance comments.
1828	The attachment at the bottom is the turbine letter.
1828	Kay
1829	Hi Janet, The attachment at the bottom is the LLC agreement.
1829	Kay
1830	Brett, I think Friday is perfect.
1830	I will confirm which is the final version, and send to you and John.
1830	Kay
1831	Did they have anything later than 900?
1832	You won't get me to bet on this one.
1833	I suggest taking out contact information and say that Purchaser will notify Seller in writing on or before January 15, 2001 as to the name/fax of the contact.
1833	Kay
1834	otherwise known as CA Development I and CA Development II
1835	Attached is the form of override letter to be executed at the same time as the GE facility agreement.
1835	It addresses accounting issues and lender requirements.
1835	I should have a final draft of the GE facility agreement later today.
1835	Kay
1836	How about notices going to CA Development, "care of" this contact.
1836	CA doesn't have any employees.
1837	Placeholder.
1838	Guess we need to make the final decision.
1839	Jim, We are meeting with them at 230 cst to see if we can reach final agreement.
1839	Kay
1840	I'll be in a meeting at Keffer's office for the foreseeable future.
1840	I'll turn on my cell phone when I leave the office.
1841	Not really.
1841	It was a format agreed to for all the LM's because the intent in most cases is to sell the project (and the equipment), and the terms in the override letter only apply when the equipment is in the financing structure.
1841	Kay
1842	I had the call anyway with Mike and Steve.
1842	We actually made progress in outlining the issues.
1842	Mike should be generating an email.
1842	We voted to take next week off.
1842	Hope that's ok.
1842	Kay
1843	no Ben
1844	I know you were anxiously awaiting these documents.
1844	Kay
1845	More fun for your file.
1846	Mark, How do you feel about their changes?
1846	Note that we MUST mark everything confidential and they don't want to agree to the non-circumvent.
1846	Kay
1847	For your information/approval.
1847	Kay
1848	I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third party escrow arrangement.
1848	Kay
1849	EECC may have this.
1849	Can you check with whoever your team is working with, or do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement?
1849	Kay
1850	As you predicted.
1851	I've had to do multiple CA's this week.
1851	I MISS YOU!!!
1851	Hope you had a great holiday.
1851	Kay
1852	Please accept changes and print two execution copies.
1852	Thanks.
1852	Kay
1853	No one has said anything to me about closing next week.
1853	Lee Johnson is on vacation next week also, so GE won't be around.
1853	Kay
1854	Per Carolyn's request.
1855	Per Carolyn's request.
1856	Please print.
1857	don't want you to feel left out
1858	Carlos, Could you tell me which of the 4 documents to print, etc?
1858	Unfortunately I have about 10 things getting signed today and I'm perplexed with what I need to do here and I can't these to figure out.
1858	Which one are you Thanks, Kay
1859	Lee Johnson is coming in today to sign off on the turbine contract.
1859	Is ESA ready to go with this one?
1859	Thanks, Kay
1860	I'm looking for the eggnog.
1860	Skip the gummis, I'll take rum!
1861	I'm working on a deal today where we are trying to get to definitive docs.
1861	It may require a DASH.
1861	Mark tells me you two have his proxy, so I want to let you know that I may be searching for you later.
1861	Kay
1862	Please take the form of the Cayuga confid agreement, and substitute this name.
1862	This is CA day!
1862	Kay
1863	Sorry, but I don't know.
1863	Probably in the next 3 hours.
1863	Maybe Jeff will be around.
1863	I have this feeling that I will be turning off the lights tonight.
1863	Kay
1864	Ben is trying to set up a conference call with ABB for next Wednesday.
1864	Dale, are you available?
1864	Pete Thompson is on vacation next week, but I suspect he would be glad to call in. Kay
1865	Great.
1865	GE and Brett's rep (John Ayres) are initially the pages now.
1865	If we can get the signature page right, we can get it over with!!!!!
1866	Hi Pete, We may have a conference call with ABB on Wednesday.
1866	Would you or Chris be able to call in?
1866	Thanks, Kay THANKS and Merry Christmas!
1867	Kathleen, I will initial and leave these in my office in a file folder with your name.
1867	Carlos has my proxy on the consent.
1867	I'm also leaving you with a couple of original CA's for Fred.
1867	He was going to email them to the other side for comment, so HANG ON to the pages I signed.
1867	Thanks, Kay
1868	Carlos, Please email the document to me when it is done.
1868	Thanks, Kay
1869	Please include pthompson@akllp.com and ccobb@akllp.com on the email with dial in instructions.
1869	thanks, Kay
1870	Hi George, I'm looking for the GE acknowledgement letter which we need for this deal.
1870	Can you email it to me?
1870	Thanks, Kay
1871	Carolyn, I wasn't sure you had the last version.
1871	This is the version agreed to by GE, which should be attached to the letter agreement.
1871	I will email an exhibit which needs to be inserted.
1872	This is an exhibit to the CA agreements.
1873	Here's the draft of the facility agreement that ABB has had to review, along with a memo for AK about certain questions.
1873	Kay
1874	I don't have any language like that on hand.
1874	I suspect it will be in great demand!
1874	Have a great holiday, Kay
1875	Hi Kathleen, Let's discuss this sometime this am.
1875	Kay
1876	Carolyn, Please forward all original documents to me.
1876	Thanks, Kay
1877	Hi Carolyn, Please email me the execution version of the documents signed last week, as well as the current version of the other documents.
1877	Were the originals put in the mail?
1877	My assistant isn't here, so I can't tell what I have yet.
1877	Thanks, Kay
1878	Happy New Year!
1878	I'm available all day except 200-330.
1878	Thanks, Kay
1879	We've handled the notices on a project specific basis.
1879	Kay
1880	Good morning.
1880	I didn't wake Paige up this am.
1880	I told Michael he could wake her up when he wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.
1880	It feels good to be back.
1880	Last week really wasn't a very good week to take off, and I was really stressed.
1880	It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two weeks!
1880	I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.
1880	Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?
1880	Love, Kay
1881	Please print and put in binder.
1881	Thanks, Kay
1882	Thanks.
1882	Suzanne just gave me the documents.
1882	I like having the electronic versions as well.
1882	I can't believe it feels so good to be back.
1882	I must be crazy.
1882	Kay
1883	Hi again, I'm looking for the language regarding invoicing which was requested last week.
1883	I want to address it with GE today.
1883	Thanks, Kay
1884	A small change...
1885	Matt, Do CA Energy Development I and II have federal EIN's?
1885	Thanks, Kay PS to all, my answers to other questions: Carolyn has corp documents Not registered to do business in Texas
1886	What would we have on the LLC's?
1886	Thanks, Kay
1887	FYI.
1887	I've been meeting with the finance folks at Enron.
1887	I'm still unclearon when we will be able to close.
1887	I do know that they believe 5 businessdays notice will be required to close, which is problematic considering the"earlier of" language relating to closing within two days of approval of thfacility agreements.
1887	I doubt that there will be "minute books" for either of these entities.
1887	Idon't expect any documents to exist other than what you've received.
1887	I'm confirming this fact today.
1887	Kay
1888	GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.
1888	I don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and I didn't see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.
1888	Any problem with Ben receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?
1888	Thanks, Kay
1889	They need to have their partner sign a confidentiality agreement, or at least we need to add language that they won't disclose it to them without having them sign a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as this one.
1889	Kay
1890	Do you know if the books are done, or are the papers in a stack?
1890	I don't wato make extra work.
1890	Thanks, Kay
1891	fyi.
1891	I haven't checked yet.
1892	Hi there, and happy new year.
1892	I have a stack of turbine contracts which were waiting for signature.
1892	I believe the override letter needed signing as well.
1892	Should I send the unsigned originals somewhere?
1892	Thanks, Kay
1893	Hi guys, Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.
1893	Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.
1893	If we don't get an immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can process them here.
1893	I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.
1893	By the way, I haven't given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last met.
1893	Kay
1894	Looks good to me.
1894	George left me a message looking for an update.
1894	If you talk to him, would you let him know that I sent the invoicing language to GE, but my contact wasn't in the office.
1894	I expect to hear from them soon.
1894	Kay
1895	Hi guys, I'm faxing you some changed pages as requested for the CA Development deal.
1895	For some reason my email wouldn't go through.
1895	I should have an answer to the invoice question tomorrow.
1895	If all else fails you can send the invoices to Ben and we can process them here.
1895	Kay
1896	Mr. Jody Pierce 1400 Smith, EB 2480
1897	Fred, I forwarded you the notice prepared by Global Finance.
1897	It requires essentially the same information.
1897	Kay
1898	Please do.
1898	Give Lil a big ol hug for me.
1898	I miss her!
1898	Did you hear that Carlos is joining us?
1898	I don't think he has told John S.yet.
1898	Kay
1899	Hi Brett, I haven't seen the fax yet.
1899	I'll check around.
1899	Maybe it got stuck in the wrong pile.
1899	Kay
1900	I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase option for the equipment for the CA transactions.
1900	We need two separate notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.
1900	Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
1900	Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the participation agreement and the development and construction management agreement.
1900	I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.
1900	By my calculations, Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.
1900	Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks and/or DevCo.
1900	It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.
1900	Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.
1900	I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.
1900	Thanks, Kay
1901	Hi Roger, We are going forward with the first deal to move stuff out of TurboPark.
1901	I don't know if you want to see these types of documents, but what the heck, here it is!
1901	Kay
1902	I haven't seen it come back.
1902	I spoke with Lynn around Christmas, and he said the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last week.
1902	I'll be glad to follow up.
1902	I was out last week and just haven't worked to that point on my "to do" list.
1902	NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.
1902	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1903	I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, with a simultaneous sale of 80% of the equity to a third party.
1903	This deal is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.
1903	I thought I would share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.
1903	Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to take something out of TurboPark.
1903	Five to fifteen business days' notice is required.
1903	There will be other documents involved as well: Bill of Sale Assignment and Assumption Agreement UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment) I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.
1903	More to come on this one.
1903	As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.
1903	Kay
1904	I've been told by Global Finance that this is how TurboPark stuff gets invoiced.
1904	I'm thinking it might help if copies are sent to project people.
1904	What do you think?
1904	Kay
1905	I need LJM.
1905	Someone in Global Finance has offered to help with that.
1905	Kay Enron North America Corp.
1906	Lee, The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.
1906	Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?
1906	I would think that we could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.
1906	The banks won't care.
1906	Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?
1906	Kay
1907	I went to Sheila's meeting.
1907	Barbara and Jeff were there also.
1907	Hmm.
1907	Don't know about the faxed signature.
1907	Feel free to call Carolyn Campbell at King & Spalding and ask.
1907	713 276 7307.
1907	Find out about faxed signature, and whether tomorrow is too late.
1907	We need the escrow account in place by FRIDAY.
1907	Is Mike Miller in?
1907	Ozzie would be fine, I guess.
1907	Thanks, Kay
1908	You know me.
1908	I don't care one way or the other.
1908	Is there a reason why you want to skip it?
1908	We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.
1908	I just thought that would be fun to do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.
1908	We can always just go for a visit.
1908	In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.
1908	Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.
1908	You'll be Michael's guide one of these days.
1909	I think it is two separate documents, one for each purchaser (CAED I and CAED
1910	Any response on the amendment to the letter agreements?
1911	WHOA.
1911	We are not wiring money, we are receiving money.
1911	This should occur either Jan 12 or 15.
1911	Minor detail.
1911	Kay
1912	Please email me the execution version of the escrow agreement.
1912	Are we using one, two or three?
1912	Thanks, Kay
1913	Sorry about the serial emails.
1913	I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.
1913	Please prepare a closing list.
1913	Between this and the financing side, I'm chasing quite a few documents.
1913	I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to know we have the amendment finished.
1913	Thanks, Kay
1914	I prefer the weekend.
1914	It gives us a reason to get in and get out.
1915	Opps.
1915	We do have to pay for the account.
1915	I was afraid we were going to send the big hunk of dough!
1916	Please print.
1917	It is amazing what I find if I check my email.
1917	Disregard the request for escrow agreements!
1917	Kay
1918	This could become interesting if it holds up.
1918	Kay
1919	Sounds promising.
1920	Hi Mark, I thought I would forward this to you for your information, since Dave may be getting involved.
1920	Kay
1921	When do you want to go?
1921	The weather should be getting nice later this week, and I need to gush about the IAOC.
1921	Kay
1922	FYI (note the closing list).
1922	Kay
1923	Sounds good.
1923	I prefer to keep it kind of small, if that's ok with you.
1923	Thanks, Kay
1924	I don't want to be the one that blows it, so I'm glad to keep you in the loop.
1925	Lisa, The previous draft of the notice just mentioned the assignment and assumption agreement, so I went generic with closing docs.
1925	Happy to list them individually, however.
1925	I live off of lists.
1925	Kay
1926	It happens to all of us!
1926	I still have a bizillion roses in my yard.
1926	I love them, and I don't baby them.
1926	I figure if they die, I replace them, since they aren't that expensive.
1926	I would love to include my friend Carlos Sole from EECC for my birthday lunch.
1926	Kay
1927	I'm proof reading now.
1927	I need a sanity check.
1927	Does the GE acknowledgement look goofy?
1927	Maybe I should set it up in a separate letter.
1927	I lifted the language from the consent.
1928	For your review:
1929	Any interest in extending it to Jan 22?
1930	I'm checking.
1931	Pete, I'm getting comments that people are having trouble opening the ABB docs.
1931	Please send the docs directly to: david.onunscheck@us.abb.com and michael.o.
1931	Thanks, Kay
1932	Here's a conformed version:
1933	Per Lisa's request please find a revised notice: Kay
1934	Attached please find drafts of the following: Notice Assignment and assumption agreement (with GE acknowledgement) Bill of sale Exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice I expect that there will be sets of documents for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II.
1934	CA Energy Development II will include a transformer as well as a turbine generator set.
1934	Please let me know if you have any comments.
1934	Kay
1935	This is a deal that will close soon.
1935	Please print and put these in a file folder.
1935	There will be other docs coming.
1935	Thanks, Kay
1936	For your review.
1937	I won't do anything about this until you reach a consensus.
1937	Kay
1938	Brett wiggs tells me that he faxed me signature pages last week.
1938	He is with Enron South America.
1938	Did you see anything?
1938	Kay
1939	Looks like your stuff.
1940	Rose, Have you seen the signature pages?
1940	We need the agreements and the override letter.
1940	Kay
1941	Hi there, Thanks for taking my car in. I admit I feel like men get treated better by car servicing people than women.
1941	I'm not just saying that, either.
1941	On the issue of Charlotte, is it your idea that she will take care of Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?
1941	I know in her email she had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a regular basis.
1941	I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience for you...
1942	They still have to fund at the same time.
1943	Works for us.
1944	Hi Brett, We haven't been able to locate it.
1944	Could you resend?
1944	Where should I send your set of docs?
1944	Thanks, Kay
1945	Even more current...
1946	Are we ready to sign these today?
1946	How many originals do we need?
1946	Thanks, Kay
1947	The ABB breakout contract and the GE breakout contract are just about done.
1947	I'm not volunteering for change order duty.
1947	Do you think this is a good Roger task?
1948	FYI
1949	Hi Jeffrey, I'm not handling change orders for the individual projects.
1949	I'm checking with Stuart (he's the COA deal lawyer) to get a consensus on the best way to handle this.
1949	Kay
1950	Lisa, Thanks.
1950	I forwarded Roger the docs separately, but thanks for the reminder.
1950	I am capable of forgetting!
1950	Kay
1951	The GE facility agreements are nearing completion.
1951	There will be facility agreements for Fountain Valley (aka PSCO) and for LV Co Gen. The form is attached for your review.
1951	In addition to the facility agreements, the parties will execute the override letters, in the form we developed last month.
1951	Here is the override letter: Please advise if there are any issues which need to be addressed.
1951	Thanks, Kay
1952	Hi Dale, Just got your email re assignment out of TurboPark.
1952	Here are the draft documents being reviewed by the lender for the movement of equipment out of Kay
1953	For your information and contemplation.
1953	Kay
1954	Ben, What's up?
1954	Kay
1955	Hi Lynn, Happy New Year!
1955	I haven't seen the executed agreement come back.
1955	Has it been signed yet?
1955	Thanks, Kay
1956	Please send the docs to me only, and I will talk to Ben.
1956	Thanks, Kay
1957	He's re-trading on the retainage.
1957	Let's discuss.
1957	Kay
1958	I'm having trouble with Ben directing outside counsel.
1958	I'm going to discuss it (politely), but I just want you to know what's up.
1958	Kay
1959	I'll check to see if he is here tomorrow.
1959	You ought to visit Frank (yes, the TRADING lawyer), Ned, Dan and the rest.
1959	It feels quite international around here.
1959	Kay
1960	ok.
1960	I'll go look at the questions again.
1961	Please print two copies, put one in a folder.
1961	Thanks, Kay
1962	Please email directly, copy to Ben, Fred and me.
1962	Thanks.
1962	I really appreciate all your good work, and will pass that along to David Runnels and Paul Pipitone soon.
1962	Kay
1963	Way cool.
1964	Yes, please.
1965	I need to go to DC next Tuesday.
1965	I'll get with you tomorrow.
1965	Kay
1966	Where are we with regard to the escrow agreements and the amendment to the letter agreements?
1966	The latter is especially critical to Enron.
1966	Thanks, Kay
1967	I'm trying to get off the phone with you know who.
1967	I'd better meet you downstairs or wherever we are going.
1968	We need to change the alcohol and drug stuff.
1968	Please call me to discuss tomorrow morning - I'll be in after 900.
1968	Thanks, Kay
1969	Sounds good to me.
1969	We really need to get this amendment signed today.
1969	Please do what you can to expedite.
1969	Thanks, Kay
1970	Perfect.
1971	Sure.
1971	The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows: instead of a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide ABB with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.
1971	Kay
1972	John, Enron owns two GE 7EA turbines, which may be sold in a structure similiar to the CA Development structure.
1972	We would like to update the letter agreements to address this possibility, and would appreciate K & S's assistance in that regard.
1972	The counterparties are not yet known, but I have heard Evista and Cayuga mentioned.
1972	If this sounds good to you, I will initiate the approval process for your retention in this matter.
1972	Thanks, Kay
1973	I've contacted John Keffer and asked them to help.
1973	I will initiate the approval process to get he and Carolyn retained.
1973	Kay
1974	We discussed this with Mike last night.
1974	He is going to get the number for us, as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere.
1974	Kay
1975	Team Turbineb, Number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements.
1975	We are also trying to get the ABB and GE facility agreements finalized so they can be tendered to Intergen today.
1975	Meanwhile, on the TurboPark front I am revising the relevant documents so the drafts can be sent to the banks today.
1975	Once the assignment and assumption agreement form is approved, it will need to be signed by GE.
1975	This doesn't have to be done today.
1975	We are also trying to get both the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters signed today.
1975	Carolyn, have the escrow agreements been fully executed?
1975	Kay
1976	I'm at home this am, as I want to go by GE's offices this am to get some signatures.
1976	Kay
1977	Hi.
1977	I'm at home, trying to waiting to visit GE's offices which are at 610 and 290.
1977	Michael has been invited to have pizza with Stephen this evening.
1977	Tommy and Julie are going out, and Stephen has a sitter (Sam won't be there), so he wanted to have a buddy over for pizza.
1977	I told Julie that Michael's calendar is open for this evening.
1977	Hope that is ok for you.
1978	I kinda hate to leave the premises since the sitter isn't sitting for us.
1978	However, it is supposed to be a beautiful evening, so we can have some adult time on the back patio.
1978	I put a couple of steaks in the fridge.
1978	Love,
1979	She didn't leave me a voice mail.
1980	Who's the lucky counterparty?
1981	Lee, You should be receiving a package shortly containing the following: 1.
1981	Changed pages for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II facility agreements.
1981	These are the same pages that were faxed to you and Kent a few days ago.
1981	I also included a couple of original pages (73, 74, I think) which were missing from one of the originals.
1981	This need to be initialled and executed.
1981	2.
1981	Acknowledgement letters for each of CAED I and CAED II which need your Here's the form: 3.
1981	Assignment and assumption agreement to move the equipment from TurboPark to the CAED I. There will be one for CAED II as well.
1981	This document is being reviewed by the bank, so I'm not convinced it is in final form.
1981	You will note that there is an acknowledgement section for GE.
1981	I cut and pasted from the consent to assignment from the TurboPark documents, but shortened the whole thing considerably.
1981	Here's that document: 4.
1981	Signature pages (signed by Enron) from the ESA deal, both the facility agreement and the override letter.
1981	Obviously, we need your signature.
1981	I will forward the final CA facility agreements to you once again, along with the blacklines against what you initialled.
1981	Thanks, Kay
1982	First flight out in the morning to National, I'll check on the return flight.
1982	For now book me on the 500 out of National.
1983	I can never get both of your email addresses right at the same time.
1984	I'm trying to figure out how to have a birthday party in DC or NYC.
1985	Sounds good.
1985	Mike will be here in a bit to sign.
1985	Thanks, Kay
1986	Please prepare for signature.
1986	Thanks, Kay
1987	This will need to be signed by ABB today.
1987	I would guess 3 originals.
1987	Ben, I suggest we let Kathleen coordinate the assembly of the docs to be signed.
1987	Kay
1988	Use this one:
1989	Please send a copy of the ABB facility agreement for CA II to Ben Jacoby and Kathleen Carnahan.
1989	Thanks, Kay
1990	yes
1991	No one is signing for CA Development today.
1991	Ben or someone from the commercial team initials, not legal.
1991	I just initial the signature.
1992	Please call todiscuss.
1993	Please call to discuss.
1994	I've sent JRigby the execution versions of the break out contract and the override letter.
1994	I've asked him to call me to discuss.
1994	FYI: The turbine contract was originally drafted by Brian Barto, then Kathy Clark took over.
1994	Scott Dieball (EECC Legal) was actively involved in the negotiations, as was I. In facct, it was the first deal I worked on after I transferred to ENA from EECC.
1994	Kay
1995	The ABB and GE agreements for CAED were signed by ABB and GE.
1995	There was a revision to the ABB agreement (deleting irrelevant data sheets) that Kathleen Carnahan will send to you.
1995	Thanks for all your work on these.
1995	We are definitely making progress.
1995	Kay
1996	Don't know yet.
1996	I'll decide Monday.
1996	It is hard to get a hotel, so Claude made me one in connection with Heather, who is there on other business.
1997	Attached are drafts of the documents to effect the transfer of two GE turbines and one ABB transformer to CAED I and CAED II.
1997	The dates and amounts are bracketed, as pending the determination of the closing date.
1997	We will need sets for both CAED I and CAED II, with II receiving the transformer.
1997	These will be prepared with the forms are agreed.
1997	These documents are subject to internal Enron review, but in the interest of time I am sending the documents to everyone.
1997	Thank you, Kay
1998	I'm working like a dog, so it is going quickly...
1999	How about 1100 am on Monday to discuss the NEXT deal?
1999	It works for John et Kay
2000	Fred, Is the ABB transformer currently in existence (already delivered)?
2000	Thanks, Kay
2001	Here's the electronic file.
2002	This goes with the GE contract.
2003	I can't believe we have a puppy.
2003	Everything smells like puppy to me, even though I took a very long shower.
2003	Michael and Pal had a nice visit this morning.
2003	Pal is still whining a bit.
2003	I brought one of our puppy books to the office, and I'll sneak a peak when I can.
2003	I did read about the up at night stuff, and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with you, the whining should stop pretty quickly.
2003	I hope the resting on the chest didn't mess it up, but boy, was I desperate.
2003	He did great using the grass when we got up.
2003	He definitely knows why we go outside.
2003	Kaley picked on him a little, but she was at her food bowl.
2003	I set up the little crate where she can't look in it, so he has an escape.
2003	We should walk the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes.
2003	We probably need to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the electronic fence.
2003	Thanks for taking the pig rat back.
2003	Love,
2004	I'll put it on your desk.
2005	I sneaked in 10 minutes of reading.
2005	The book made me think that we shouldn't let Kaley growl about food.
2005	I'll double check.
2005	How's your day?
2005	Kay
2006	Looks like this needs to be cancelled.
2006	Thanks, Kay
2007	I don't remember seeing an agreement, which isn't to say that I haven't.
2008	This is the turbine contract for the 7EA's.
2008	Kay
2009	The DCMA states in 6.01 that notice can be given by the designee.
2009	Karl thinks the notice must come from the DCM (ENA).
2009	Does it matter?
2009	I don't mind ENA giving the notice in this case, but I wanted to see what the team thinks.
2009	Kay
2010	I believe this letter is applicable to the Blue Dog turbines:
2011	Peter, I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before.
2011	Essentially, it is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by E-Next Generation, but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is assigned to a third party.
2011	We will need something along the same line for the ABB equipment.
2011	If you can send me a redline of the final form of the ABB facility agreement against the master, we can discuss how to proceed.
2011	Thanks, Kay
2012	Hi Suzanne, I haven't seen a revised flight schedule from TAP.
2012	Have they made the change yet?
2012	Thanks, Kay
2013	Hi Elizabeth, I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or purchase/sale of commodities.
2013	A little birdie told me that you worked on something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.
2013	When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.
2013	Thanks, Kay
2014	Carolyn, These should be the correct blacklines to include in the transmittal with the GE facility agreements.
2014	Carolyn and I are coordinating the delivery of the facility agreements to Kay
2015	Please print on letterhead.
2015	Kay
2016	Do you want to print, sign and fax, or shall I take to Janet or someone else to sign?
2016	Kay
2017	Looks good.
2017	I'm checking to see who will sign.
2017	Have you received the delivery yet?
2018	Subject: Re: Comparison of ABB Agreement
2019	You should have also received the original GE agreements and acknowledgement letters.
2019	The transmittal letter has been signed and is being faxed to you and delivered.
2019	Kay
2020	Looks to me like notice will be given Wednesday or Thursday.
2020	The changes are being made to the CA I documents now.
2020	Kay
2021	I had Ozzie sign it, and it has been sent to Carolyn.
2021	Kay
2022	The stuff is being delivered in accordance with the notice provision of the letter agreements, which means the original goes to "President".
2022	A copy is also being delivered to George, so he would be a good one to make distribution at Intergen.
2022	Kay
2023	Will he be there tonight, or shall we go for tomorrow am?
2023	Kay
2024	I will be travelling to Washington DC tomorrow (Tues) with Mark Bernstein.
2024	If we finish up tomorrow, I will travel back to Houston tomorrow night, and will be in the office on Wednesday.
2024	I hope to take this Friday as a vacation day.
2024	Kay
2025	Is the notice the only change?
2025	If so, it looks ok to me.
2026	Here's a set of CA I revised docs.
2026	If these are ok, we will get CA II lined up as well.
2026	I'm on the road tomorrow, but should be back in the office on Wednesday am.
2026	Kay
2027	Please create a duplicate set of documents in my CA Development folder, just changing the name to CA Energy Development II LLC.
2027	I'll need both sets.
2027	Thanks, Kay
2028	Hi Lisa, I'm back, and will finish up these docs this am.
2028	The notice provision does not require that all the closing documents be completed as of the date of the notice, although I expect to have the package finished anyway, including the CA II documents.
2028	We expect the escrow to be funded today, so as far as I know we will want to give notice today, although it might be later than the am, depending on when the escrow is funded.
2028	Ben, Fred, are you ready for us to give notice?
2028	Kay PS.
2028	Laurie Mahon says "hello".
2029	I'm attaching the notices for CA I and CA II.
2029	Please pay particular attention to CA II, since it is the first time it has been circulated.
2029	Obviously, we will need to insert the final purchase numbers.
2029	Lisa, I set it up so ENA is consenting, which tracks the language in the DCMA.
2029	Kay
2030	So long as the equipment is held by E-Next, Jody Pierce needs to get the invoices, although copies can be sent elsewhere.
2030	Kay
2031	Sounds good, but if today isn't a good day, it is not a problem.
2032	I would like to have a chance to read it, which I haven't.
2032	I still finishing up the Intergen docs.
2032	The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to react, which might result in some changes to the contract.
2032	In the case of the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the equipment after assignment.
2032	Kay
2033	She says you worked together at Chase.
2034	I haven't talked to anyone.
2034	I've got 10 docs going out this am, but I'm almost finished.
2035	Well, you must be famous in the I bank bidness, as she claims to know you.
2036	Attached are assignment and assumption agreements for CA I and CA II.
2036	The only changes to the GE form were those changes suggested by Lisa, and a little clean up.
2036	Kay
2037	Opps.
2037	Didn't mean to leave you out!
2038	Here are the two bills of sale for the Intergen transaction.
2038	The only change to the form was the insertion of the date.
2038	The CA II bill also reflects the sale of the transformer.
2039	I love Vincent's and it is close, so I say we go for it.
2040	I'll be forwarding multiple emails containing the Intergen documents.
2041	This is a new transaction, so you can put in your two cents worth early!
2041	Kay
2042	Here's the guts of the deal.
2043	Fred, As we discussed, we need the physical addresses where the equipment in TurboPark is being stored.
2043	As I understand it the equipment is in at least a couple of places, and we haven't advised the banks of that fact.
2043	Thanks, Kay
2044	Sounds great.
2044	I'm starving also.
2045	I still plan to be out on Friday - guess I should use my discretionary holiday first.
2045	I should be in NYC Wednesday and Thursday.
2045	I don't need you to do anything in that regard yet.
2045	Thanks, Kay
2046	I'll hang it up.
2046	Kay
2047	Viola!
2048	Lisa, GE is asking for fully executed copies of thedocuments they signed in connection with the TurboPark transaction.
2048	If I can get copies I will be glad to make distribution.
2048	Kay
2049	It looks like things are moving forward on the Intergen/CA deal.
2049	If we can verify the status of the wires we will want to give notice today.
2049	Fred Mitro is working on this and will give you a call to up date the status.
2049	I have not seen the final numbers to plug into the notices.
2049	Is this information available?
2049	Kay
2050	Hi Lisa, Sounds good to me.
2050	We will be sending unsigned docs, with signature pages to be provided later?
2050	Kay
2051	The closing dinner for the big financing will be on Feb. 8.
2051	Just thought I'd keep you current!
2051	Love, Kay
2052	Please locate Jody Pierce's fax number, and send it to Peter.
2052	Thanks, Kay
2053	One.
2054	When I asked the question, I was told that the invoices needed to go to Jody.
2054	If there's a desire for the invoices to go elsewhere, it will need to be addressed with Lisa Bills, with Roseann Engeldorf being consulted.
2054	I do not know if the financing documents limit or otherwise specify the handling of invoices.
2054	Hope this helps.
2054	Kay
2055	I haven't talked to Ozzie today.
2055	When I spoke with him last night, we were arranging to meet in NYC next Wednesday, and I told him we could celebrate there.
2056	I expect to be out of town Wednesday and Thursday of next week (don't worry, Ben can ALWAYS find me).
2056	I would like to review the stuff before I leave town.
2056	Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look?
2056	Do you guys think we need or should give Intergen the assignment docs and the bills of sale?
2056	Kay
2057	So do we have someone to watch the menagerie?
2057	I can probably get out around 600.
2057	I could probably leave sooner, but I wouldn't get anywhere any quicker!
2058	Sounds fine to me.
2059	I had a HUGE lunch (Vincent's), so something light sounds good.
2059	We could do the usual appetizers at Grotto.
2060	Thanks.
2060	Did you have a good one?
2060	Michael was all "cracked up" over the card you sent!!
2060	Kay
2061	Hi Pete, Please send a copy of the FV break out contracts to Sheila Tweed (Al works for her).
2061	She needs the info this am, and doesn't want to wait until Al gets in. She would also appreciate a list of the outstanding issues.
2061	I'll talk to you in a bit on the ABB override letter.
2061	I don't think there will be much to it.
2061	Kay
2062	Sheila, Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.
2062	I've asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.
2062	I need to do an override letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.
2062	I spoke with Lisa about that yesterday.
2062	Kay
2063	Neil left to go hunting this am, Paige leaves for school tomorrow, leaving me, Michael and our new puppy (mid life crisis dog) to our own devices.
2063	I'm taking the day off tomorrow, and Monday is an Enron holiday, so I'm looking forward to some Kay time, working in the yard (weather permitting), watching Oprah, etc.
2064	Hi there, I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for GE's acknowledgement.
2064	It is pretty close to what you saw last week.
2064	It would be a big help if we could have these executed by GE today or tomorrow.
2064	A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals picked up from Lee's office.
2064	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2064	Thanks, Kay
2065	Attached are electronic versions of the final docs for the CA Development transactions.
2065	If there are no other comments we will get the Enron signatures.
2065	How many originals are needed?
2065	Noticed was faxed to the Admin Agent this am.
2065	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2065	Kay
2066	I never get both of these email addresses right on the same email.
2066	Kay
2067	Here's what I have on H-2.
2067	Sorry Pete, I thought I had sent it to you previously.
2067	Kay
2068	I think you can just include the electronc file and the appropriate person can print it off when they print the Word file with the rest of the contract.
2068	I don't have any better idea than that.
2068	Kay
2069	Please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this am (name in footers).
2069	Thanks, Kay
2070	I haven't seen the originals.
2070	I can send you an email which has the name of the files, but I do need them printed so that the footer appears with the name as opposed to the temp file number.
2070	Thanks!
2070	Kay
2071	Viola!
2072	Carolyn, On the insurance, I would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements, $10m in coverage (without aggregate), deductible no greater than $25,000 for which they are responsible.
2072	We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better.
2072	Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine contract.
2072	The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at closing.
2072	Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table?
2072	Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.
2072	Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the indemnities lasting longer.
2072	I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2 years in this deal.
2072	I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the facility agreement.
2072	14.
2072	I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the equipment is being acquired from ENA.
2072	I would also eliminate "or any other third party" on the fifth line.
2072	Defined terms: "Commercial operations" isn't in the definitions of the turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their somewhere (an EECC specialty).
2072	Please verify.
2072	Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement?
2072	Thanks, Kay
2073	I just sent my comments to you and Carolyn.
2073	Kay
2074	KIDDING!!!!
2074	I'd go with Bubba, but that's what we call our cat.
2075	Pete, I have a question.
2075	Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to be listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?
2075	If so, what amount goes in there?
2075	Will this defeat what we are trying to do in keeping the original price a supposed mystery?
2075	Thanks, Kay
2076	Attached is the GE override letter to accompany the facility agreements.
2076	I'm trying to figure out the ABB form.
2076	Kay
2077	I would think that the LOC's for #s 2 and 3 should be for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II, since we will close on those transfers next week.
2078	The practice has been for someone from Enron familiar with the project (not a lawyer) initials each of the pages for both contracts, inlcuding exhibits.
2078	So, we need to make arrangements for that to happen.
2078	Each of GE and ABB do likewise.
2078	So, who is the lucky person for your project?
2078	Kay
2079	It doesn't need to be a VP.
2079	It was a function previously performed by EECC contracts people.
2079	Ben initialled on the Intergen form, and John Ayers (I think a develop engineer) initialled for ESA.
2079	I'm off on a day of vacation this am (the Enron kind), so I picked up email early.
2079	Kay
2080	Hi Kathleen, I left a stack of initialled docs on the appointed chair in my office.
2080	If you will email me Janet's telephone number, I will call and leave a voice mail about you bringing her the docs to sign.
2080	Thanks, Kay
2081	I agree.
2081	Please revise the form accordingly.
2081	Thanks, Kay
2082	Fred and Rebecca should be talking to Accounting about this.
2082	Do you want me to respond to your email and copy them?
2083	Have you talked to Karl yet?
2083	Do you mind calling him?
2083	Thanks, Kay
2084	I think your suggestion about the effective date was quite logical, but it seems to me that it is more of a Sweetgum issue than ours.
2084	Unless you think we have a problem, I'm ok with going along with George on this.
2084	I presume the original LLC agreement allows for either the Member to sign or an Officer of the LLC.
2084	I also assume that Janet Dietrich is an officer of both CA's.
2084	Therefore, I'm fine with your suggestion.
2084	Kay
2085	The agreements haven't been executed, so please revise.
2085	Could you also set me up a stand alone release, so that I can replace the release GE submitted on some of the other turbines?
2085	Thanks, Kay
2086	I ordered these for Christmas, and am totally aghast that these orders are just now being processed.
2086	What is going on?
2086	I am appalled that this wasn't handled weeks ago.
2086	Kay Mann
2087	Thanks for hanging in there and getting it done.
2087	How come you didn't tell me that you didn't get Ben's initials?
2087	I never expect to have to follow up with you to see if you did what we discussed.
2087	I just always assume that you've taken care of it, unless you tell me otherwise.
2087	I don't want to change my expectations.
2087	Deal?
2087	Kay
2088	Ok, I'm out of it.
2088	Where's she going?
2089	Please do what you can to find out what is going on.
2089	I know you forwarded these to Carolyn, but I would still appreciate it if you could investigate, or ask Carolyn to do so.
2089	Kay
2090	Congratulations on your promotion.
2090	You deserve it!!!!
2090	Kay
2091	Hi Elizabeth, Congratulations on your promotion!!!!!
2091	Kay
2092	Unless someone else volunteers, I guess I'll do the ABB override letter.
2092	I've mentioned it to Pete Thompson, but he is in our offices today, so he can't do it.
2092	Rob Taylor did the initial draft of the GE version, but Rose finished it, with a bit of help from me.
2092	It should be a fairly short letter.
2093	This is where I will be this afternoon.
2093	Kay
2094	My trip may be back on for tomorrow.
2094	I'll know more later.
2094	I have a meeting from noon-500 this afternoon, at the Hyatt.
2094	Today looks crazy.
2094	Does Charlotte know how to pick up Michael, and about Rosco?
2094	Love,
2095	John, Attached is the term sheet concerning the matter we've been "voice mailing" about.
2095	Please call me at your earliest conveneince concerning conflicts, Thanks, Kay
2096	Kathleen, There were three original assignment and assumption agreements: One of CAED I (GE) and two for CAED II (one for GE, one for ABB).
2096	I only see two in my packet, and only two are referenced in the transmittal letter.
2096	HELP!!!!!!!!
2096	This is obviously urgent.
2096	Kay
2097	I'm thinking that the 1st paragraph of the GE override letter needs massaging, since it refers to the master agreement.
2097	I'll be glad to do it when I can, but I'm knee deep in the ABB agreement at this point.
2097	Kay
2098	The Intergen LOC should be in CAED I and CAED II's names, issued after closing on the 18th.
2098	The PSCO deal team should handle the PSCO LOC, which should be in the name of the PSCO project company, I think, after that deal closes this week.
2098	Al Larsen and Sheila Tweed can address these.
2098	Hope this helps.
2098	Kay
2099	Here's my stab at it: I'll be in an off site the rest of the day.
2099	I have no pride of authorship.
2099	I'm unclear which entity will be signing the agreements, so I've left some
2100	GE posts an LOC in lieu of retainage.
2101	Please cancel the hotel.
2101	I suspect the whole trip will cancel, but I don't want to give up the flights yet.
2101	Kay ps THANKS!!!
2102	Hi.
2102	My trip was postponed until next week.
2102	There's a happy hour (official/formal) for my client groups.
2102	It would probably be a good idea for me to stop by, but it isn't mandatory.
2103	FYI.
2103	Seems like this is something you should ok.
2104	If the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of E-Next (aka the project company) it would seem that the Transfer Date should probably be redefined to reference an assignment to an unaffiliated company.
2104	Same thought on the GE override.
2104	This is because the override will still be in effect if E-Next owns the equity in the assignee.
2104	Kay
2105	Hi Ben, I got an opinion from outside counsel.
2105	I'll give it a look so we can discuss.
2105	I'll move it up on the list.
2105	Kay
2106	I feel fairly confident that you received change orders 1-4.
2106	If not, please advise.
2106	One of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the LV Co Gen equipment.
2107	Pete, I sent change order #4 to you and Paul on November 3rd, via email.
2107	I will resend it if you can't find it.
2107	Kay
2108	See attachment.
2109	I have a conflict.
2109	How about 300?
2110	Pete, I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC (our affiliate).
2110	From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the Fountain Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for plants comprised of 6 or more units.
2110	It would seem to be applicable in this case.
2110	Was it deleted intentionally?
2110	Thanks, Kay
2111	Please add back in. You might want to hunt down that fax and see what you think about the suggestions.
2111	Kay
2112	Enron is entitled to an additional output guarantee when we have 6 or more units installed in a facility.
2112	Peter missed the point, and I didn't catch it because I really didn't look at FV very closely at all.
2112	Rigby caught it.
2112	He disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional guarantee, and I will try to figure out his point.
2112	Kay
2113	Good question.
2113	I'll ask around.
2114	Here's the slide presentation from yesterday's meeting with the NE Power Team.
2114	Kay
2115	Pete, I suggest that Exhibit S state that GE has received all sums owing, without a reference to who paid it, since they will have been paid from multiple sources.
2115	Thanks, Kay
2116	Just wanted to confirm that we are moving ahead for the Intergen closings.
2116	Lisa, I spoke with Karl, and he has promised to let me know if there any hitches on their end.
2116	His preliminary assessment was that everything was ok, but he wants to check.
2116	Ben, Kathleen will be bringing the documents to you to initial this afternoon, then I will sign off so Janet can execute the documents.
2116	Rebecca, please confirm that Carolyn has the final wiring instructions for the movement of money out of escrow.
2116	I presume that we would like to close early enough to see money move tomorrow, since the payoff amounts have been calculated based on closing tomorrow.
2116	I don't know what is required to make the payoff to TurboPark, so I hope someone knowledgeable is handling that end.
2116	My trip was postponed, so I'm around.
2116	Kay
2117	Wow, Rebecca was reading my mind!
2118	Please make the requested change to the signature blocks on the following docs in my CA directory: EXECUTIONCOPY Bill of Sale (CAED I) EXECUTION COPY Assumption with GE ack (CAEDI) EXECUTION COPY Bill of Sale (CAEDII) EXECUTION COPY Assumption re ABB (CAEDII) EXECUTION COPY Assumption with GE ack (CAEDII) (I think this is the correct name) When this is completed, please email these agreements to Karl, copy to me and Kathleen Carnahan Thanks, Kay
2119	For your review.
2120	Pete, I intended for you to call me about Rigby's comments to discuss.
2120	I don't know that ENA is willing to accept all of what he wants.
2120	Please call to discuss implications of his comments.
2120	Kay
2121	Evidently we are experiencing some technical difficulty on this end.
2121	The task should be finished shortly.
2122	Gee, when's the Super Bowl?
2122	That was nice of her.
2122	My day is HECTIC, but what's new.
2122	I can't seem to get any traction on getting things done.
2122	Michael wanted to go to Jilian's tonight, but I told him no.
2123	Enron has signed the docs, except for the revised escrow instructions, yet to be received.
2123	Ben will be coming to your offices at 900, so he can sign the instructions at that time.
2123	I've pulled the financing documents from the stacks.
2123	I hope to have a copies of the docs tomorrow, and if so, I'll have something to give Intergen.
2123	See you tomorrow!
2123	Kay
2124	I love these stories!
2125	I'll be in meetings in and out of the office until around noon.
2125	I sure would like to get out of here by 600 tonight.
2125	Wish me luck!
2125	Thanks for putting the dogs out and taking Michael to school.
2125	Sorry about the doggie accident.
2125	It will take time.
2125	I checked the kindergarten website, but it didn't have any info re Wear White Day.
2125	I can pretty well figure out what he is supposed to wear (white), but I'm not sure why.
2125	I believe the 19th is MLK's real birthday, if that has any significance.
2125	That's not much info, I know...
2125	Hope you have a good day.
2126	He also has white tennies.
2127	Yes, please.
2128	Hi Chris, Happy New Year.
2128	Hope all is going well with you.
2128	We miss you!
2128	I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.
2128	The guys around here are kicking around some different asset management ideas, so I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into some different approaches.
2128	Do you have anything you can email me?
2128	Thanks, Kay
2129	Heather, Attached is the CA we discussed.
2129	I changed the last paragraph to add the expiration of the exclusivity provision, as I think this is probably a bit easier to enforce.
2129	Kay
2130	John, I appreciated your help.
2130	I'm glad we got to do a real deal, even if it was a strange one.
2130	More to come!
2130	I'll check on the sitter, but dinner on the 2nd sounds great.
2130	Kay
2131	Hi.
2131	Hope things are going well for you and your shadow.
2131	I don't feel so good, so I'm seriously considering going home.
2132	You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in the future.
2132	I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA.
2132	I do not know their function or role.
2132	As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say that it would depend on the comment.
2132	Essentially, the deals are ENA deals, not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility.
2132	Also, ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the contractor.
2132	The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals) is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a contractor.
2132	So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and the EPC contractor.
2132	Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the negotiation process.
2132	Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how things worked when I was with EECC.
2132	On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place?
2132	I'll let you know if I think of anything else.
2132	I suspect Sheila will have some insight, also.

2133	Antitrust Division Won't Challenge Electricity Distribution Cooperative WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could find no lessening of competition in any electric power market.
2133	The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide electric service predominantly to rural consumers.
2133	Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income to its member/customers.
2133	Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1, 2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas will change greatly.
2133	Consumers now purchase electricity only from the regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is located.
2133	Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's door under regulated distribution charges.
2133	The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's regulated transmission and distribution activities.
2133	To ensure that the utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the transmission and distribution system operations are required to function independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at retail.
2133	The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an alternative energy service provider.
2133	Distribution cooperatives, under the act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or they may assign them to an affiliate.
2133	The rates for the standard service package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission.
2133	The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers throughout Arkansas.
2133	All retail marketing activities outside the traditional local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through the joint marketing venture.
2133	If a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for any and all consumers.
2133	The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its default customers to the joint venture.
2133	Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint venture is likely to market.
2133	The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members.
2133	Procompetitive Effects In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not appear to have any anticompetitive effect.
2133	He commented that "while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition."
2133	Melamed added that "the existence of other, larger potential entrants into [the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate, any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the distribution cooperatives."
2133	The business review letter is available at Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004.

2135	Did you check out the link to the spandex picture?
2136	Hope you feel better soon!
2137	Could you let me know how many there are, so I'll know how we want to handle this.
2138	I'm feeling fine today.
2139	Shall I check with Charlotte about dinner at Keffer's?
2140	Hi.
2140	We can get a computer hook up through Time Warner for $15 month.
2140	Could you ask John if he likes it?
2140	Can it be installed anywhere in the house?
2140	Thanks, Kay
2141	Sandra, Can you confirm that a non-smoking room was requested?
2141	Thanks, Kay
2142	Hi Charlotte, We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.
2142	Can you take care of Michael?
2142	The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him off.
2142	Michael got a hair cut this weekend.
2142	I think it makes him look taller.
2142	I wish it worked that way for me!
2142	It is very short, and I think very cute.
2142	Kay
2143	Your vote?
2144	I think I'm going to be in NYC tomorrow, otherwise I'd say your place.
2144	I'll find out what Neil thinks.
2144	Thanks, Kay
2145	John, We have a sitter lined up, so Feb. 2 sounds great for dinner.
2145	Neil and I are looking forward to it.
2145	Kay
2146	I am scheduled to be out of the office Tues-Thurs of this week.
2146	I will be in New York with Mark Bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the Co Op City deal.
2146	This is one of the asset management deals I'm working on for the NE Power Team.
2146	I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still the possibility that it might cancel.
2146	Kay
2147	This looks like too much trouble.
2148	Hi there.
2148	Is this required by our agreement, or just a nice touch?
2148	We have a fairly long list of people who we would have to track down, and it seems to me that these people can be replaced (or have been) without the formality of resigning.
2148	I'll send you the list separately.
2148	Thanks, Kay
2149	Yes, but you would have to track down all those people.
2150	You might have this info anyway....
2151	Please calendar for Sheila and me.
2151	Thanks, Kay
2152	Are you ok?
2153	I didn't go back and check, but I believe the bills of sale or the assignment/assumption agreement may help, as one of these should have the serial number.
2153	I think you may have a spread sheet that ties serial numbers to unit numbers.
2153	At least I hope so!
2153	Let me know if this doesn't get you what you need.
2153	Kay
2154	Here 'tis.
2154	I don't think it compared the charts, but it found lots of other things to compare.
2154	Kay
2155	I think you should send them back to Lee and let him dispose of them.
2156	Here's something to look at.
2156	Kay
2157	I figure longer life expectancy is just to make up for all the crummy female days we have.
2157	We probably have the same number of quality days as men.
2157	If that!
2158	I saw pictures on the tv screens on one of the floors, but I didn't hear about the capture.
2158	How did they do it?
2159	This term sheet relates to a new deal of Mark Bernstein's.
2159	We haven't responded to it yet.
2159	I suspect you will be consulted about it soon, so I thought I would give you a heads up.
2159	Roger and Herman have heard a bit about the project, and Joe D has been briefed.
2159	Looks like more for TurboPark.
2159	Kay
2160	Yes, this is issue is still around.
2160	Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.
2160	In it SW is clearly taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery under the contract.
2160	I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, I have another question.
2160	What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?
2160	Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it have some greater significance?
2160	Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?
2160	I assume not, but I want a sanity check.
2160	Thanks, Kay
2161	He is chatty in the am.
2161	I enjoy the ride with him.
2161	I'll let CB know that I'm in town.
2161	Kay
2162	Should have included you guys as well.
2163	Here's the current draft for a sanity check:
2164	Does this mean they didn't have to induce?
2164	Please tell her congrats if you talk to her.
2164	Kay
2165	My trip cancelled, so I'm around.
2165	I can pick Michael up at your place if this is easier for you.
2165	Kay
2166	You might check out this link and look at the classes.
2166	I haven't been able to take anything but orientation yet, but I hear great things about the classes.
2167	This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).
2167	Is there any special deal on payment for the change order?
2167	I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc. Kay
2168	Sounds fine to me.
2168	Kay
2169	Could you forward the attachment referenced in your email?
2169	(we all do that)
2170	FYI
2171	Hi Ben, Has anyone asked you to take a look at this?
2171	If not, I would be interested in your comments.
2171	Kay
2172	Hi there.
2173	I'll send you the final doc's so we can discuss.
2173	I generated the forms, then finance and the banks commented on the forms.
2173	Kay
2174	As promissed.
2175	For Tom H.
2176	Are any of these available?
2177	Sheila would like to re-schedule tomorrow's call for Friday.
2177	Could you send out an email to the GE/Enron group to find the best time?
2177	Thanks, Kay
2178	I think Sheila probably got this invitation.
2178	I'm planning on going assuming I'm in town.
2179	Hi.
2179	Charlotte is taking Michael home because they were going to McDonald's.
2179	Will you be leaving for home at 600?
2180	Mitch, I need to get the LJM signatures.
2180	I've spoken with the Finance folks who can help with this, and I'll try to get that wrapped up asap.
2180	Kay Enron North America Corp.
2181	I'll follow up.
2182	You sound so pitiful.
2182	I haven't forgotten you!
2182	Kay
2183	ABB is asking for its original of the facility agreement.
2183	In fact, I need to get originals of the ABB and GE facility agreements to ABB and GE.
2183	When can I get those docs?
2183	Thanks, Kay
2184	Hi.
2184	Who can meet when?
2185	Here's the latest...
2186	I can only open it if I launch it.
2186	I can't view it.
2186	You might try that.
2186	I think I can print it.
2187	Please see if you can get me 30 minutes via phone with John Klauberg at 130 today.
2187	He mentioned in his voice mail that he might want to bring in someone else from his firm, which is fine.
2187	Mark Bernstein will also be on the call.
2187	I'll call him at 130 (CST) if he is available.
2187	Thanks, Kay
2188	So are you Gold?
2188	If not, go ahead and use the miles if you want.
2189	I'm glad that Michael had the opportunity to meet Dr. B. Thanks for making that happen.
2189	Kay
2190	Tomorrow is fine.
2190	Kay
2191	ENA Legal (TBD) 1.
2191	ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project (O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement, etc.).
2191	2.
2191	ENA Legal represents the interests of advises the origination and development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as required.
2191	and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.
2191	3.
2191	ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the structure.
2191	Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1.
2191	EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been agreed.
2191	2.
2191	Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO while at the same time working with the deal team.
2191	to procure equipment for the same project.
2191	ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained.
2191	3.
2191	Comments returned to EE&CC need to either be incorporated in the next draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to vendors.
2191	4.
2191	EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as possible.
2191	Forms of "standard" agreements should be discussed/agreed to enhance consistency.
2191	5.
2191	Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should be prepared by EECC.
2191	EECC should provide information concerning the existence of such service agreements.
2191	6.
2191	ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts personnel have been tasked to prepare.
2191	EECC Legal can assist by providing input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.
2192	Just got it, so I haven't read it.
2192	Please let me know what you think.
2192	Kay
2193	Looks fine to me.
2194	I'm sorry, I thought that you would remember that this is one of the Chicago/People things, since we recently discussed Jones, Day,, etc. My bad.
2194	Kay
2195	I presume that you would just as soon continue to follow this?
2195	Kay
2196	FYI.
2196	These is in essence the sale of two of the Illinois development sites that I worked on.
2196	I'll follow up.
2196	Kay
2197	No TurboPark?
2197	No GE or ABB issues?
2197	I feel like I'm missing something....
2197	I'll get up to speed asap.
2197	Kay
2198	FYI.
2198	No action required.
2199	Well, I hope this won't be too complicated.
2199	Did you hire Cory, and if so, what did you think?
2200	Here is one option.
2200	The problem would be getting him picked up when I'm out of town.
2200	Charlotte might be able to help.
2200	Also, there's the Presby church.
2200	I wonder if SOTW has something.
2200	He might enjoy a visit.
2200	I just got to work and got my computer up and going.
2200	Yes, the whole ordeal was 1 1/2 hours.
2201	I just noticed that I forgot to send you the originals of the letter agreements.
2201	I will have the ABB contract picked up at the same time.
2201	Thanks, Kay
2202	I'm all for getting as much booked in Q1 as possible.
2203	At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.
2203	I'll miss the Turbopark closing dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a headache.
2203	I will miss getting the pat on the back.
2203	I didn't want to miss Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.
2203	As you know, things are subjec to change.
2203	Kay
2204	Hi Charlotte, We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.
2204	They pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if you might consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).
2204	I suspect most days he could go to your place.
2204	I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would run it by you early on.
2204	I have to think about how much travel I might have, as it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.
2204	Paige has applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we would be in good shape.
2204	Here's a link.
2204	They have some neat themes.
2204	Have you heard of any other good day camps?
2204	You seem to be plugged in fairly well.
2204	Thanks, Kay
2205	Hi Kathleen, I'm having difficulty reading parts of paragraphs 15 and 17.
2205	Are these jumbled on your screen?
2205	Thanks,
2206	We have 4 of each of these available at $19 (or whatever face value is).
2206	Just let me know what you want to do.
2206	Thanks, Kay
2207	Well, there's an argument to be made that the remedy for breach of an option agreement is us suing them for specific performance, ie, making them sell us the land.
2207	Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement, I don't worry about arbitration.
2207	Let me think about it, though.
2208	Guess what?
2208	The closing party isn't until Feb. 8.
2208	I had the wrong week!
2208	Glad I didn't show up on the wrong day....
2208	BEAUTIFUL weather.
2208	Might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail (or equivalent) tonight.
2208	I had Mexican food for lunch, so popcorn for dinner!
2208	Love, Kay
2209	I called him.
2210	Good idea about taking the sausage.
2210	Are you going to the store?
2210	If you do, I could use some Diet Coke, silver and gold.
2211	Well?
2212	This is the same lady from yesterday/this am.
2212	How does the fifth ticket work?
2213	Ok.
2213	My hubby tells me the tickets you want are available, and he'll put your name on them, so to speak.
2213	Kay
2214	Note change from Def to Clay.
2215	OK.
2216	Ann, I'll be there.
2216	Thanks, Kay
2217	Any idea what the going rate is for a limo on a Thursday?
2217	Nothing extraordinary needed, just your basic version.
2217	Thanks, Kay
2218	It should be under Diaz, Ann, if she got an invite.
2218	Surely she got invited.
2219	Corey, Thanks.
2219	Was the doc based on any previous Enron transactions?
2219	Thanks, Kay
2220	I wanted to make sure that you saw this.
2221	I was supposed to make a "To Do" list of the World Hunger Team: Limit of liability/Indemnity - Steve has provided a draft.
2221	Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes, the basic issues remain for discussion.
2221	Confidentiality - Mike has circulated a revised draft.
2221	Termination - This ones on my list.
2221	Warranty - Scott has some comments to discuss.
2221	We also discussed streamlining the time lines, etc. Kay
2222	I don't think Carolyn needs them, but I will think about it.
2223	Hi Clark, Good to hear from you.
2223	I'm headed to NYC this week, so lunch doesn't look good.
2223	I would love to see Nancy, though.
2223	She did a very nice job for us.
2223	I can't find any information on Corey.
2223	Can you give me a little background information?
2223	I couldn't find him in the BP directory or website.
2223	Hope all is well with you, and I hope we can get together soon.
2223	Kay
2224	Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on: Co Op City asset management arrangement: In this deal, Enron would build a small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op City.
2224	We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.
2224	We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the balance sheet and maximize the mark.
2224	We are working on a term sheet, and I will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.
2224	Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO Houston is involved.
2224	I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.
2224	Sell of two development projects in Illinois.
2224	Two of the sites we have developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me about supporting the transaction.
2224	Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of experience of the person they have designated.
2224	I've asked Clark Thompson for some information on his background.
2224	SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the equipment.
2224	We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of this equipment.
2224	We are also trying to sell the equipment (a turbine/generator set) to Calpine.
2224	Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.
2224	We received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.
2224	We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them buying 26 megawatts.
2224	We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and the project development agreement with the State.
2224	It is quiet right now, as funding is figured out.
2224	There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.
2224	GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a standard contract for buying turbines.
2224	I've heard a rumor that we will be buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.
2224	I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.
2224	Kay
2225	I have a meeting at EECC which is scheduled from 1130-130, but there is a risk it will run long.
2225	300 would be better.
2225	Thanks for setting this up.
2225	Kay
2226	Do we have a ca with either Co Op City or a company called Riverbay something or other?
2226	Thanks, Kay
2227	Works for me.
2228	I saw Scott Dieball at Mr. Izzo's going away reception, and shared the happy news that we voted unanimously for him to set up the next conference call.
2228	Kay
2229	There's a monthly birthday party thing at 300 up here.
2229	I know you don't always get the word, so here's the word.
2229	How's your brother?
2230	How about a ca with PB Power (or Parsons Brinckerhoff Power)?
2230	Thanks, Kay
2231	Gotta hear about your trip.
2231	Was it fun?
2232	How about some new carpet?
2232	I HATE THE CARPET IN THE BEDROOM, although it does hide dog hair well.
2232	If we want to stick with dark carpet, I like the green upstairs.
2233	Well, there's no instant gratification with that, although it is logical.
2234	FYI.
2234	You are welcome to join us.
2234	Kay
2235	Yes, please.
2236	I need a reciprocal confidentiality agreement with: One Penn Plaza New York, NY 10119 attn: Mr. Stephen Losi re: potential asset management transaction with Riverbay Corporation relating to Co Op City.
2236	One year term.
2236	Thanks, Kay
2237	Make that Brinckerhoff.
2238	Did I write you back?
2238	Everything is going well here.
2238	I like the work a lot, and I have some nice clients.
2238	I can't wait for Carlos to get here, though.
2238	I went to Izzo's going away reception last week.
2238	Boy, there are a lot of new faces over there.
2238	In in New York the rest of the week.
2238	Maybe next week.
2238	I hope you keep baby pictures with you at all times!
2238	Kay
2239	Geez, lots of choices.
2239	Your vote?
2240	You're right, it sounds better spoken than it looks written.
2240	I get the point, though.
2240	4ish my time looks good.
2240	Kay
2241	Could you check with Ben to see if he wants a set?
2242	When you get a minute I need to discuss the last attachment for the Co Op term sheet (the asset management one).
2242	Here's the current state of the draft: We do not have a current CA with PB.
2242	I will have one in the am to send out.
2242	Do you want Jude, et al to look at the EPC contract stuff?
2242	Kay
2243	Absolutely.
2244	Lisa, I've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet.
2244	We will have some comments on the asset management attachment, but I don't have those together yet.
2244	In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement.
2244	Therefore, I'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so that we can send you other documents.
2244	Thanks, Kay
2245	This is important stuff.
2245	Pop quiz material.
2245	Kay
2246	Have you asked Rusty?
2246	I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday.
2246	I made the changes myself.
2247	Here's the option we discussed yesterday.
2247	It has some farm tenancy stuff which I want to make sure you see.
2247	Thanks, Kay
2248	Let's discuss.
2249	Sorry about this.
2249	I forgot!
2249	I'll give it a look.
2250	I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically.
2250	I've forwarded the current version to Herman for his review and approval.
2250	Due to some of the changes, Enron may need some revisions as well.
2250	Kay
2251	Here we go with a renewal that puts us to 7.6%, but the purchase price is not so much.
2252	Hi David, The owner is willing to do this cost plus.
2252	Do you have a cost plus form that you like?
2252	It was good to see you yesterday, by the way.
2252	Do you want me to include you on follow up emails on this?
2252	Kay
2253	View it, don't launch it, then you can print it.
2254	Hi.
2254	I paged you soon after I left the school, but never heard back.
2254	I also tried your cell, but it said it wasn't on.
2254	Are you plugged in today?
2255	Ace, I'm a lawyer at ENA.
2255	We are selling some of our peakers, and in conjunction with the sale we have agreed to not contest Siemens Westinghouse retaining the Blue Girl reservation payments.
2255	SW has asked that LJM sign off on the agreement, and Rose has suggested that I send the original agreements to you, and indicated that she would help coordinate signature.
2255	Your help is appreciated.
2255	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2255	Kay
2256	I've sent it to the Finance group who will obtain LJM signature.
2256	If I have any problem (ie, it looks like it won't be done this week), I'll let you know so maybe you can expedite on the commercial side.
2256	I'd like to give them a day or two first.
2256	Kay Enron North America Corp.
2257	I need your EXCEPTIONAL help with this...
2258	I just noticed a glitch, which I'll fix.
2258	Do you have any comments?
2259	Imagine that.
2260	I made it to NYC with no problem.
2260	The weather is nice enough, but windy.
2260	I'm on my way to a meeting.
2261	Fred, If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to the form, then duplicate it.
2261	Do you see any problem with this?
2261	I will have to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.
2261	I brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form.
2261	Have they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still kicking tires?
2261	I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's most important, especially since I'm on the road.
2261	Do we want to continue marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?
2261	I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.
2261	No TurboPark!!!
2261	On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.
2261	Monday would be 1000 times better, if this is at all possible.
2261	In that won't work, I will have more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.
2261	Thanks, Kay
2262	Please give this a look and take a first stab at it.
2262	Thanks, Kay
2263	OK.
2263	Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway.
2263	Kay
2264	Hi.
2264	There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something close.
2264	I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.
2264	Could you email it to me?
2264	Thanks, Kay
2265	Please email me whatever version of the doc you sent to them.
2265	When it is time for discussions meaningful discussions I would like to be involved.
2265	Thanks, Kay
2266	Hi John, I'm out of town, but will give this a look when I return.
2266	Kay
2267	Did I send this to you yet?
2267	Kay
2268	I'm flying home tomorrow, but I won't be in the office.
2268	Does today look better?
2268	WE NEED CARLOS!
2268	I've picked up several new deals this week, a couple of them would be perfect for Carlos.
2268	Kay
2269	Hi John, Mark and I are still working at the hotel, waiting to hear from the counterparty.
2269	Could you forward this to Jon?
2269	I don't have his email address.
2269	Thanks, Kay
2270	I agree that we don't need outside counsel on the call at this point.
2270	If I'm available, I'm happy to participate.
2270	The scheduling problem is due to my travel plans.
2270	I'll join in if the call is at a time I can fit in. Otherwise, I'll catch up with you later about the results of the call.
2270	Kay
2271	Thanks.
2271	Do you have some free time today?
2271	I'm not sure about our schedule, but if we have free time which matches up with you, I would like to spend some time discussing the issues.
2271	Kay
2272	Gentlemen, As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power plant.
2272	We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use something that is acceptable to NEPCO.
2272	I will then take the laboring oar in order to get a working draft prepared for this project.
2272	As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.
2272	Thanks, Kay
2273	kinda cute...
2274	Here tis!
2275	Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having someone fax it to me?
2275	I'll email my fax number to you.
2275	Much Grass, Kay
2276	thanks
2277	Here's the first one...
2277	Thanks, Kay
2278	Please print the second agreement (the letter agreement) and fax to me.
2278	Thanks, Kay
2279	It doesn't look like it is going to work out to meet today.
2279	We should be back next week, though.
2279	Kay
2280	Many thanks.
2280	When I first started in the E & C bidness all our company did was cost plus work.
2280	I may have some old exhibits about how the mulitplier was used to capture benefits and burdens, both for field people and home office.
2280	You know the goal is to never create an original document!
2280	Kay
2281	I'm in NYC, returning tomorrow.
2281	Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling, but I really didn't think we would hear from him again before today.
2281	We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind.
2281	Paige got a new one for Christmas, and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House.
2281	We enjoyed our visit also.
2281	Thanks for everything.
2281	Sorry to hear about the girls.
2281	Tis the season.
2281	I hope Lisa has a nice birthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.
2281	Gotta go meet someone.
2281	Love, Kay
2282	You might hear from Mac tonight (hope so!).
2282	You can give him my cell phone for when he gets in, and we can leave a key under the doormat.
2282	Gotta go meet Mark.
2282	Love, Kay
2283	Yes, but let me review it before anyone else sees it.
2283	Thanks, Kay
2284	I know we don't do the bbq, but I would think about this...
2285	Not yet.
2285	We are working on a solution.
2285	Kay
2286	How's about we talk about it?
2286	I think that's more efficient.
2286	As long as we talk before the next call, we should be in good shape.
2286	Kay
2287	Hi there.
2287	This came in while I was on the road.
2287	Mac mentioned his girlfriend, but he didn't mention the Rice thing.
2287	Hmmm.
2287	We would love to have him at UH, since he won't aim any higher, and we thing it beats SWTS.
2287	He and his friend were wonderful house guests.
2287	I hope no one got worse on your b day.
2287	Many happy returns!
2287	Love, Kay
2288	Hi there.
2288	Nothings comes off the list.
2288	New additions are as follows: New transaction with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, relating to the creation of a jointly owned control area to address generation, transmission, and retail load delivery.
2288	It is brand-spanking new, so I don't know much more than this.
2288	It is being handled by Ozzie Pagan.
2288	New opportunity with New Jersey Natural to develop projects using Fuel Cells.
2288	Heather Kroll is the contact.
2288	Sale of Blue Dog (GE) turbine.
2288	Likely buyer (at last word) is NRG.
2288	Could be complicated if GE protests.
2288	There's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from GE, but I haven't been contacted.
2288	The rumor came from GE reps, who asked if I was working on it.
2288	Sheila isn't handling, either, last I knew.
2288	Everything else is the same.
2288	I expect to be in NYC in the middle of the week to continue negotiations on the Co Op City deal (with Mark Bernstein).
2288	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2288	Kay
2289	This is a slam dunk.
2289	Don't screw it up.
2289	Ok, seriously.
2289	Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.
2289	John, it is hard to believe that you could have acutually have married UP.
2289	Good for you.
2289	Please thank Debbie for a perfect night.
2289	John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership.
2289	For real?
2289	I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.
2289	I don't expect a problem, and am ready for it if it surfaces.
2289	No big deal.
2289	Kay
2290	I checked all my emails, and I don't have any indication that I received/reviewed this version of the document.
2290	The redline is the redline against the last version I have on file.
2290	If the other folks sign before it has been reviewed internally, it is possible that changes will be required.
2290	It won't be extensive.
2290	I will ask Karen Way to call me before making changes to drafts, or at least advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly.
2290	Kay
2291	This should be good enough.
2291	Thanks, Kay
2292	Attached is a red-line of the revised form against the form John S. sent me.
2292	Please advise of any comments as soon as possible.
2292	Kay In the interest of time I'm sending it out before I've reviewed it, so forgive the typos, etc.
2293	Please email the letter to me before Ben signs it.
2293	Thanks.
2294	Hi Pete, Here's the contract we discussed on the telephone.
2294	To make life easier, please set the exhibits up as a separate electronic file.
2294	It is a heck of a cut-and-paste job, but it will really help when we start blacklining docs.
2294	Thanks, Kay
2295	It is a CompareRite document.
2295	If you "view" it in email, then you can save it as a Word document.
2295	If this doesn't work, let me know and I'll create a Word doc.
2295	Kay
2296	Yes.
2296	I got someone else to help me.
2296	Thanks anyway.
2297	Hi there, I've made some suggested changes on the CO you sent.
2297	In the interest of time I'm sending this to David Marshall, since this largely deals with ROL and insurance, and I couldn't tell if he has read this previously.
2297	Thanks, Kay
2298	I should have included you.
2298	Sorry!
2299	I had Mexican food for lunch, so LITE dinner for me.
2299	I had lunch with Oz and Heather.
2299	Oz drove us in his new MB convertible.
2299	Really nice.
2299	It is a 430, silver.
2299	How's your day?
2300	Please check the last couple of pages and see if I'm close.
2300	Kay
2301	Please print all of these.
2301	Thanks, Kay
2302	I'm having copies made of the due diligence binders.
2303	When I travel for more than one day, I usually take my computer and use it on the road.
2303	Hope you are enjoying this perfect weather!
2303	Love, Kay
2304	I hear Erik Kingshill is moving on.
2304	Also Paul Myford is looking for a new spot.
2304	What a lot of changes.
2305	Opps.
2305	I thought we were talking about the same CO. Could you please send me a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by reference?
2305	This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.
2305	Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?
2305	I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.
2305	Thanks (and sorry for the confusion), Kay
2306	Hi there, Please get someone to hang my white board behind my door.
2306	Thanks, Kay
2307	JD approved referral of this to Keffer et al.
2307	Fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty - his preference is yesterday.
2307	I would think that a discussion with Fred about the deal might be in order today, even if by phone.
2307	What is your availability?
2307	John/Carolyn, have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any notions about how to structure this deal?
2307	Is the format ok?
2307	Can we make it more seller friendly without being ridiculous?
2307	When the initial draft is ready, it will need to go to Matt Gockerman (ENA Tax) and Herman Manis (structuring accountant).
2307	Ciao,
2308	Fred, I suggest a phone call among the team today to make sure we are all on the same wave length.
2308	What is your schedule?
2308	Thanks, Kay
2309	That just means there is plenty of work to go around!
2310	Here's a first draft.
2310	I can't find a working printer to print to (what a way to work), so I haven't printed it yet.
2310	If you can print a copy, I would appreciate it.
2310	Kay
2311	I'm tied up but you don't need me anyway.
2312	They put it in the middle of the wall.
2312	Please have them come back and put it behind my door.
2312	Thanks, Kay
2313	Here's the answer to the tax and accounting questions.
2314	Come look.
2315	We need to finish up with the site specific agreement for the equipment, then they can have the whole enchilada.
2315	I would think it could be ready in a week.
2315	I'll get A & K to dust it off.
2315	Kay
2316	Hi there, Did I ever send this to you?
2316	This one is back on the radar screen.
2316	Thanks, Kay
2317	Hi Pete, I'm attaching parts of an email I received from one of our technical folks regarding the C of Austin turbine contract.
2317	I have to send it in pieces because it is so large.
2317	Thanks, Kay
2318	Here's what Eric wrote: I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.
2318	Those changes are redlined.
2318	Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them.
2318	These were related to exhaust temperature and energy.
2318	I know this is a simple cycle plant and they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it anyway.
2318	It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined cycle.
2318	If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust guarantees.
2318	Let me know what they decide.
2318	Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to your file.
2318	(It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.) I therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.
2318	It is now attached as a separate word file.
2318	Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.
2318	Exhibit "U" is not in my hard copy.
2318	My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."
2318	If you get something from GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.
2319	For your reading pleasure.
2319	I would add that I told them that their role would need to be defined by you, the developer, and Technical Support.
2320	I'm faxing a page because the email wouldn't go through.
2320	Kay
2321	Next Monday?
2322	I'm a little concerned about the neighborhood (no offense), but I thought you could drive by at lunch.
2322	They also have a facility at the St. Regis school.
2322	Lastly, if you watch as you drive home (I know you are looking around anyway) you might see a church with a sign up, etc. Maybe Grace Presby might have something.
2322	I'm concerned about bringing Michael downtown because of my travel schedule.
2322	Kay
2323	By the way, I was talking to my friend and colleague Rose, and she tells me that the company has hired a car to take Rose, another person and me home on Thursday after the big party.
2323	Nice touch, huh?
2323	We all live close to each other.
2324	Lee asked that I pass this along.
2324	Please let me know if you want some tickets.
2324	Kay
2325	I will have a minute in about an hour.
2326	Hey there.
2326	I'm back in the saddle again.
2326	I'll get crackin' Kay
2327	I'm not leaving town...
2328	Yes, I'd be glad to talk to him.
2328	I know we want to build generation in New York (the next state to have brown outs).
2328	Until Carlos gets settled in send the guys to me.
2328	Trust me, it won't take long to get him settled in!
2328	Kathleen, do we have a land holding company for that region?
2328	I want to think about a two-tiered approach due to balance sheet issues created by expensive land.
2328	I'll think about it from a TurboPark standpoint also.
2328	Kay
2329	Yeah well.
2329	Next week!
2330	It is just too far out of your way.
2330	I'll try to see if I can catch a ride somewhere.
2331	Innovative is a euphemism for something, but I can't figure out the right word.
2331	What every means "Company Most Likely to Exhaust its Lawyers with Impossible Structures and Processes"....
2332	Gentlemen, This was my first written request for a cost plus contract.
2332	The request was made to NEPCO because at that time NEPCO was supposedly still involved in the project.
2332	I left subsequent voice mails for Dave and John Schwartzenburg, then mailed a follow up email to the gang at noon on Thursday, February 1st, copying various folks at EECC.
2332	John Schwartzenburg was out of town, but went out of his way to accommodate my request so that by Thursday evening, I had a form from EECC.
2332	I worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project, and forwarded it to EECC on Monday.
2332	I received no response to the revised draft.
2332	I have recently heard that the EECC form that I spent worked on is being scrapped, and we are starting over.
2332	Is this true?
2332	Kay
2333	As a follow up to my previous e-mail, here is the second request, which was in my opinion adequately addressed by John Schwartzenburg.
2333	I am frustrated with beginning the process over again.
2333	Kay
2334	Where's Ben's name?
2335	I NEVER talk to him anymore.
2335	I haven't talked to him in TWO weeks!
2335	I usually don't go more than a day or two, at the most.
2336	Good one.
2336	Nothing worse than an aimless off site.
2337	Renee, Question: Are the GE performance guarantees completely voided by the use of inlet chillers?
2337	The first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me.
2337	I'm not sure how the stuff included in the second series of bullet points fits in. Are these changes in scope, suggestions, conditions?
2337	I think we would be better off increasing the length of the change order to include the pertinent stuff, but not attaching the letter as a reference.
2337	Thanks, Kay
2338	Do you need the electronic file?
2338	All I sent was the redline.
2339	Hi Randy, Could you fax or email me a copy of the EECC Mou with PB or Riverbay, or whoever.
2339	My fax number is 713 304 8716.
2339	Thanks, Kay
2340	Per your voice mail.
2340	Kay
2341	Does this mean the LV Co Gen deal has fallen apart, or are there some new LM's in our future?
2342	Makes sense to me.
2343	Dick, Thanks for your reply.
2343	I have since been assured that we will build on what has happened thus far, which is a huge relief to me.
2343	If we see forward progress tomorrow we will be all smiles.
2343	Again, thanks for your reply.
2343	Kay
2344	One thing to put on the list (which may be there all ready) is that we want our officers/directors to effectively resign at closing.
2344	Another detail (and note who is getting this email): I've had three instances recently where agreements have been forwarded to the counterparty prior to legal review.
2344	As much as I hate to suggest this, it may be best to have the drafts forwarded to Enron Legal before the commercial team receives the docs.
2344	Kay
2345	Has Herman seen this or the 1st amendment?
2346	Please let me talk to Ben.
2346	Thanks, Kay
2347	Just use a regular CA (yes, I changed my mind), describe as a power generation transaction (no equipment reference).
2347	Thanks,
2348	I don't think we need the language, especially since the guarantees won't apply to retrofitting the plant later.
2349	Ben Jacoby is having an offsite Friday at the Hyatt for the East Development group to discuss 2001.
2349	He has asked me (and I think Roger) to sit in. I'm planning on attending.
2349	I'm sure either or both of you are welcome, although it won't be a problem if you don't attend.
2349	Kay
2350	Here's a first stab at the LOI.
2350	I just guessed on the attachment.
2350	I have a couple of questions: Any thought as to how we get/split money (other than the obvious up side for us)?
2350	Do we want to work toward a "Project Development Agreement" which will set forth the basis for how we develop projects on a project-by-project basis?
2350	Or do you envision a different next step?
2350	Talk to you soon, Kay
2351	Please call Lee Johnson and tell him that one of our development lawyers, Roger Balog, would like 2 tickets for Friday.
2351	I hear Ben wants a ticket for Thursday, but I assume he communicated that to Lee.
2351	Thank him for me, but I have my closing dinner tomorrow, and no sitter Friday.
2351	Thanks, Kay
2352	Do you mean LITERALLY across the street?
2352	Yikes.
2352	That's making it tough to ignore.
2352	Steak doesn't really appeal to me.
2352	Maybe a Ciro's salad?
2353	Lee just called, and he is here, so if you haven't called him yet, please don't.
2353	Kay
2354	Hi there, Lee doesn't remember getting a fax from me yesterday.
2354	Did you get a confirmation back?
2354	It was the same fax that was sent to Pete Thompson.
2354	Thanks, Kay
2355	I'll forward the email and you can print and fax.
2355	No big deal.
2356	Thank you.
2357	Gregg, I think I'm in good shape and can look at what John sent tonight.
2357	Ed, just stand by and I'll holler if I need anything.
2357	Thanks, Kay
2358	Brian, I didn't get the revised draft.
2358	Kay
2359	ok.
2359	I thought it was a lot to ask.
2360	Here 'tis:
2361	Hi there, I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.
2361	This form of contract assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the procurement of the equipment, and how it will be procurred.
2361	This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron review and comment.
2361	Thanks, Kay
2362	Karen, It appears to me that revisions were made to this agreement, and the agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me being consulted.
2362	Perhaps you did email this to me and I can't locate the electonic file.
2362	In any event, in the future, please call me on the telephone BEFORE revisions are made to documents and presented to the counterparty.
2362	If you can't reach me by phone, send me an explanatory email.
2362	Also, please email me redlines against prior drafts.
2362	This will faciliate my review.
2362	Faxing drafts does not work for me.
2362	I will send you the required changes tomorrow.
2362	Thank you, Kay
2363	Hi, Things are going just fine here.
2363	I'm looking forward to spring - baseball and gardening.
2363	I want more weather like last weekend.
2363	I was in NYC last week.
2363	I managed to get lost walking around Midtown.
2363	I know, that's impossible.
2363	I was talking on my cell and walking.
2363	I walked from Bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater district.
2363	Oh, I should add I was headed to the Omni at 52nd and Madison.
2363	When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead, it clicked that I was off track.
2363	My feet hurt so badly when I got back I could hardly stand it.
2363	Are you going to spring training this year?
2363	Gotta get back to work.
2363	Thanks for writing.
2363	Kay
2364	Scooped me on Ray.
2364	I like him.
2364	I heard Debbie Chance is transferring to another group, and that Reagan is going to be an originator (not a developer).
2365	Here is a draft for your review, and if you think appropriate, distribution to NJR.
2365	Please let me know if you want changes made.
2365	Kay
2366	Same city, different Westin.
2366	This one is on the Riverwalk, the other was near the Hyatt.
2366	I like San Antonio for the trip though.
2366	Easy!
2366	Busy as usual.
2366	Love, Kay
2367	I'm getting hourly updates.
2367	I haven't talked to John today.
2367	Carlos tell you about the security guard by HR?
2368	OPPS.
2368	I registered twice.
2368	I'm just taking up one seat that day!
2368	Kay
2369	Hi.
2369	How's it going?
2369	Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?
2369	We could ask your mother to sit for a little while.
2369	I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.
2369	The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know if I ever want to change groups.
2369	I thought that was nice.
2369	I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.
2369	I figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't a lot of "mom/son" opportunities.
2369	(be realistic) Maybe we should take a Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.
2369	Love,
2370	Could you check out the sitter thing?
2370	We could drop off Michael and take the Enron Field shuttle.
2370	I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do it.
2371	Hi John, The enovate version looks fine.
2371	I suggest this change to the Peoples version: iv) is required to be disclosed to comply with any applicable law, order,regulation or ruling or to enforce enovate,s or PMW,s rights in court or in an arbitration proceeding in connection with the Limited Liability CompanyAgreement of envoate dated April 26, 2000, as amended, modified, and supplemented from time to time (the &LLC Agreement8).
2371	If PEC is requested or required (by oral question, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, PEC will promptly notify ENA of suchrequest or requirement so that ENA may seek an appropriate protective orderor waiver in compliance with provisions of this Agreement.
2371	If PEC and ENAare both parties to the proceeding, PEC will agree to an appropriate protective order.
2371	Thanks, Kay
2372	John, I think I misspoke (or miswrote).
2372	The change I suggested would belong in both versions.
2373	Pardon the delay, but I inadvertently left you off the email.
2373	Kay
2374	He's going to be at the birthday party or at Matt's.
2374	Maybe we should drop him off.
2375	Attached is the form of option agreement for the Schaeffer option which passes muster.
2375	The changes are relatively minor, but have significance from an accounting and legal perspective.
2375	Kay
2376	Looks good to me.
2377	Hi John, Just opened my email.
2377	I have a meeting tomorrow off campus.
2377	Next week looks good, though.
2377	Any free days?
2377	Kay
2378	Sounds great.
2379	Here's where I'll be tomorrow.
2380	I think it is fine to send it to Lee and Kent.
2381	Chris, Your invoice for December reflects final revisions to the documents through December 20th, so I'm assuming the draft the Schaeffer's signed was done subsequent to anything transmitted on December 13th.
2381	However, emailing documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help.
2381	Thanks for your response, Kay
2382	I appreciate the heads up - I'll try to chase down the fax (it hasn't been delivered yet).
2382	Can you email me the blacklines just in case?
2382	Thanks, Kay
2383	In your presentation today you mentioned an assessment agreement and an interconnection agreement.
2383	Roger says he isn't working on it.
2383	Who in Legal is handling those docs?
2383	Thanks, Kay
2384	How many times do I have to say EMAIL IT?
2385	FYI.
2386	Gentlemen, Attached for your review is a draft of the letter of intent.
2386	Please let me know if you have any difficulty opening this document.
2386	Kay
2387	I'm leaving now.
2388	Fred, When you need something for a project, please come to me first (or whoever might be the appropriate ENA lawyer).
2388	Going directly to the outside lawyer creates problems.
2388	For instance, it is Enron policy that we do not pay outside counsel for work not referred to them by an ENA lawyer.
2388	Thanks, Kay
2389	I have your rodeo tickets.
2389	The total is $114.
2389	Kay
2390	My only advice is to be very specific in their scope.
2390	These guys run up bills worse than anyone.
2391	FYI: another instance of work being sent directly to outside counsel.
2391	In this case it was an additional assignment related to an ongoing project.
2391	Kay
2392	Previous correspondence on the topic of assignment to outside counsel.
2392	See 10/10 email from me below.
2393	Hi there, Any comment?
2393	Thanks, Kay
2394	Lee, I've forwarded your email to Eric, and have asked for his response.
2394	The changes were his.
2394	Thanks, Kay ps Thanks for the invite Friday.
2394	We had a great time.
2395	Hi Mark, Here's the latest, incorporating the "arrange for" approach on the EPC and Kay
2396	Good morning, Just checking in. Michael and I had a good morning.
2396	No weird outfits today.
2396	Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.
2396	So what do you think about the stone thing?
2396	I like the way Bob's front yard looks.
2396	I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.
2396	Our yard is looking better, though.
2396	Hope you are having a good day.
2396	Love,
2397	fyi, we have staff meetings on the first and third Wednesdays, at 130.
2397	The meetings usually last an hour or less.
2398	Did anything get set up?
2398	I'm booked at 200, but otherwise available.
2398	Kay
2399	Please draft a letter to the guy listed in the first email below (Hartzell at ITM), using the stuff in Chris' email as the body of the letter.
2399	Save under General LOI, and I'll finish the letter.
2399	Thanks, Kay
2400	Hi.
2400	This is one of my top priorities.
2400	I think it looks fine.
2400	What do you think?
2400	Kay
2401	FYI.
2401	I have jury duty on Wednesday, Feb 14.
2401	Kay
2402	Hopefully you will get some credit for it, also.
2402	I just love Lisa.
2402	I think she's a ton of fun.
2403	Looks like it is ok to keep the same.
2403	How's the GE master form agreement coming along?
2403	When do you think we will have a draft?
2403	Thanks, Kay
2404	FYI.
2404	Note that PSEG wants to sign a binding LOI.
2404	Carlos and I will discuss how to move forward.
2404	Thanks, Kay
2405	Fred, Sounds "do able".
2405	Please contemplate what would be acceptable as "outs" for them and for us.
2405	A,lso, will you be getting RAC involved soon since we are contemplating a binding agreement in the near future?
2405	My best guess is that the LOI will be prepared in house, but I will discuss this with Carlos, and we will advise K & S of their role.
2405	Thanks, Kay
2406	I sent him an email earlier, and he left me a voice mail back.
2406	I'll call him and see what I can find out.
2407	Hi Pete, We want the GE form to be on an individual turbine basis.
2407	As for work priorities, I would put it in front of the City of Austin agreement.
2407	Thanks, Kay
2408	Sheila, I have jury duty on Wednesday.
2409	How depressing.
2409	I really was liking the idea of a Durango.
2409	I do think Lisa and Bobby have been pleased with theirs, but maybe they've just been lucky.
2409	Mitsubishi isn't attractive to me, but I don't know why.
2409	I really can't think of much unless I go back to the idea of the small Lexus.
2409	The big one is just too expensive.
2409	I don't want a Ford (that knocks out a lot), you don't like the 4 Runner, and the Land Cruiser is too expensive also.
2409	I don't remember being particularly impressed with either the Yukon or the What else is there?
2410	Please print.
2410	Thanks, Kay
2411	I'm having a set printed.
2411	Kay
2412	Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am.
2413	Poor baby!
2413	At least it is only twice a year, or in her case, this one last time.
2413	I think I may take him fishing with my dad and mom in Palacios.
2413	He really loves it, and my dad is in declining health, but can still get around.
2413	I hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together.
2414	I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.
2414	Fridge foraging is fine.
2414	I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace myself.
2414	Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly.
2414	Guess I should go look.
2415	My dad has the same thing as Sheila's mom (athlersclerosis).
2415	He gets tired easily, and doesn't walk very well.
2415	But at least he can still walk!
2415	He's only 70, but this stuff is progressive.
2415	A long future is unlikely.
2415	Michael adores his PopPop, and March is a nice time of year on the cost.
2415	If I'm there I can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad, which helps.
2415	What kind of vehicle to you have?
2415	I've decided that I need an SUV.
2416	Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a Lexus or a Toyota?
2416	With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America.
2416	How can we be so sure?
2416	Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.
2416	Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus.
2416	Despite its greater size, the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or better its upscale cousin.
2416	Braking will likely prove impressive, too.
2416	Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop).
2416	Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped.
2416	Helping to meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood of the RX.
2416	Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs.
2416	of torque at 4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i).
2416	The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a 2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs.
2416	of twist.
2416	The four-speed automatic transmission provides a "snow mode" for easy starts on slippery surfaces.
2416	With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle tough terrain.
2416	But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls.
2416	Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs.
2416	VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck (car?) back under control.
2416	In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors.
2416	Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.
2416	Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded.
2416	Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard.
2416	Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features.
2416	Leather upholstery is available on V6 models.
2416	Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001.
2416	We'll bet demand outstrips supply.
2417	Thank you.
2417	I really liked Don.
2418	?EDMUNDS' REVIEW Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a new path to the premium outlet center.
2418	Though the exterior may exude that tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty.
2418	Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked against newer competitors.
2418	So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar powerplant.
2418	When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter, DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque.
2418	Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25 foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear.
2418	The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged at speeds up to 50 mph.
2418	On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands.
2418	All-Mode operates in 2WD, automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on the dashboard.
2418	We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling, further enhanced by solid unibody construction.
2418	The interior, one of the friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated instrument panel.
2418	A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws.
2418	You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents.
2418	All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD player and ABS.
2418	Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE.
2418	Those same models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after Christmas, don't we?).
2418	A "Birdview" navigation system, shared with the Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it.
2418	While the "Birdview" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions.
2418	Get a map.
2418	Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a relatively small vehicle).
2418	Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations.
2418	Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower.
2418	With this updated, competitive package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of the Dodo.
2419	Here are the AES documents.
2420	Did I miss anything?
2421	This might be really helpful.
2422	I had a nice trip in. I tried a slightly different route, and it was uneventful.
2422	Kinda slick, though.
2422	How much does it cost to mail a letter now?
2422	Is is $.34?
2422	Of course I have a bunch of 33 cent stamps.
2422	I have no clue how much rock that would be.
2422	I should measure the length of the beds, then I could compute how much to get, at least sort of.
2422	There's some grass to be dug up also.
2422	I think I will start with the Advil today!
2423	I've been researching the Pathfinder today.
2423	Nissan has a pretty good website.
2423	I like the little videoscreen - how's that for a toy?
2423	I'll go back and look at the Toyota.
2424	Please call John Keffer and re-schedule Thursday's lunch - two meeting have come up.
2424	Friday is good for me.
2425	The posted number was a mistake.
2426	I'm going!
2427	Hi Randy, Here's what you missed.
2427	My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing issues at this point since I don't have the outside counsel doing anything now.
2427	When John called me last week and asked the question I gave him that opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.
2427	Sorry about that!
2427	Kay
2428	John and Randy, I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions to the Co Op City EPC contract.
2428	Specifically, I deleted language he had added to the waiver of consequential damages.
2428	Bob had added a provision that said that the waiver was "subject to" the indemnification section of the contract.
2428	I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the contractor's point of view.
2428	Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.
2428	Just wanted to pass this along.
2428	Kay
2429	Hi.
2429	Lisa (Mellencamp) and Chuck are getting married, date unknown.
2429	He has given up his apartment and has moved in. That makes 6 teenage girls under one roof, although 3 of them are there every other weekend.
2429	I really like both of them, so I think this is nifty.
2429	Kay
2430	I want to go to this on Thursday.
2430	I rsvp'd myself.
2431	Hi Charlotte, What's your preference today?
2431	I can either meet you at our house, or pick up Michael at your place.
2431	Kay
2432	This looks good to me.
2432	We'll track down Janet if that is ok with you.
2432	Kay
2433	Yes.
2433	At least now I don't also have lunch with John!
2434	As far as I know it is fine.
2435	Do you want to include Mike Sandridge also?
2435	Kathleen?
2435	I'm happy to volunteer my assistant, Suzanne, to help with the logistics, restaurant suggestions, keeping track of rsvp's.
2435	Kay
2436	I'm all for that.
2436	I may take him out very early to look at the tractors.
2437	Oh, yeah, that's right.....
2438	Hi Sharon, Michael will pass on next week's appointment.
2438	He and I have the day off together, so I'm making some special rodeo plans.
2438	His winter report from his teachers was good.
2438	He is meeting or exceeding expectations in all categories.
2438	We recently visited at school and watched him for about an hour, and he was attending very well, sitting still (well, relative to the other kids), following instructions, raising his hand to be called upon, etc. You should have heard him speak Spanish - it was so cute.
2438	We visited in the am, and I haven't seen him in the afternoon without meds.
2438	The class schedule hasn't required an afternoon dose as of yet.
2438	Hope all is well with you.
2438	Kay
2439	Hi Tana, A little birdie tells me that you have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk Management Glossary booklets.
2439	Am I getting close?
2439	I've found it to be very helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.
2439	Could I get a copy for him?
2439	Any other good power references?
2439	Thanks, Kay
2440	Good afternoon, I'm forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet, showing revisions from your original version.
2440	We look forward to seeing you soon.
2440	Thanks, Kay
2441	I don't know the dynamic between the Intergen team and Team Coral.
2441	Assuming there's no bad blood, I don't suppose it would hurt.
2441	I just don't know enough about the situation.
2441	I have jury duty today, by the way.
2441	Kay
2442	Thanks for agreeing to help.
2442	Please call Ben Jacoby to get things going.
2442	Kay
2443	You might find Stephanie and ask for a copy.
2443	This is a very nifty reference tool.
2444	Hi Mark, I don't know what these folks are up to.
2444	In fact, I didn't know that Scott Laidlaw was involved.
2444	When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA developer.
2444	Any word from the Co Op/PB team?
2444	I have jury duty in just a little while, so I'll be out of touch for a short while.
2444	Kay
2445	Please calendar.
2445	I don't know if I'm going to be out of town.
2446	Anything for the grocery list, my sweetie pie?
2447	Hi Steve, Here's what NJR received.
2447	Kay
2448	I thought you might enjoy this.
2448	You should have seen Michael's eyes while he was riding in that Mercedes convertible yesterday.
2448	He was speechless, and you know how rare that is!
2448	I suspect we will be hearing about it now...
2448	Kay
2449	We had a good time.
2449	I always enjoy Ozzie and Heather.
2449	Carlos joined us, too.
2449	Ozzie has a new Mercedes convertible, and he drove me to Michael's babysitter to pick him up.
2449	Michael's eyes were the size of saucers!
2450	must be for real
2451	Let's discuss.
2452	Rusty, I will get with Kathleen and we will prepare on a form.
2452	However, you will need to provide one of us with the details on a case-by-case basis, so that we (Kathleen) can generate the CA's and track them in the legal department database.
2452	If we have the following information, a CA can typically be generated on a same day basis: name, address of counterparty, including name of contact person type of deal contemplated what type of information is being provided whether both parties are providing information whether exclusivity/non-circumvention provisions are desired Thanks, Kay
2453	Thank you.
2453	I appreciate it.
2454	Sounds like a good approach to me.
2455	1.
2455	Remedies, Jurisdiction, Arbitration and Governing Law.
2455	Money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Optionor, and the Optionee shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies upon proof of any such breach.
2455	Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by Optionor or any of its Representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Optionee.
2455	Excepting the right of Optionee to seek such relief, all claims and matters in question arising out of this Agreement or the relationship between the parties created by this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
2455	The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
2455	There shall be three arbitrators.
2455	Each party shall designate an arbitrator, who need not be neutral, within 30 days of receiving notification of the filing with the AAA of a demand for arbitration.
2455	The two arbitrators so designated shall elect a third arbitrator.
2455	If either party fails to designate an arbitrator within the time specified or the two parties' arbitrators fail to designate a third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointments, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA.
2455	It is expressly agreed that the arbitrators shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, the parties hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover punitive or exemplary damages, either in arbitration or in litigation.
2455	The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York.
2456	I set up a directory called "Confidentiality Agreements" and put a form in there based on what KC sent me.
2456	I'm so proud of myself.
2457	Yes.
2458	Choice of law doesn't impact place of arbitration.
2458	We just need a starting position...
2459	Hi Pete, Here's some language to be included in the form contract.
2459	Thanks, Kay
2460	More for the contract...
2461	Hi there, On the options we should delete the reference to the Federal Arbitration Act, so that the sentence with that reference ends with "binding arbitration".
2461	I changed it on the confidentiality agreement, but missed it here.
2461	Carlos caught it.
2461	Kay
2462	One of us can.
2463	Carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails, so I'm sending this along.
2463	Kay
2464	Hi John, I haven't been able to find you number.
2464	I wanted to discuss the confidentiality agreements, and whether you envision that other confidentiality agreements may be necessary or required.
2464	Thanks, Kay
2465	Hi Gregg, I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).
2465	If you have it I will follow up with a phone call.
2465	I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this afternoon.
2465	I'll try to track her down tomorrow.
2465	I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.
2465	Kay
2466	As you know, Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate.
2466	Our group in Chicago is looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate.
2466	We had initially envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how Enron would invest the funds, etc. The other owner of enovate, Peoples, has proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this arrrangement.
2466	This is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise, so I'm writing you guys for input, direction, etc. Suggestions?
2466	Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote?
2466	Kay
2467	Gentlemen, I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this time.
2467	Kay
2468	Hot off the presses.
2468	I'm looking at it now.
2469	Hi.
2469	My meetings in Florida are scheduled for Feb 28, March 1 and March 2.
2469	I do not know when I will be leaving, but if there is a way to leave on the morning of the 28th, I will do so.
2469	More details to follow!
2469	Kay
2470	Steve, My best days are: Kay
2471	I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years.
2471	Oh my gosh.
2471	At least I know how to work out, and I know not to take it to the limit the first time out, but it is still hard to move.
2471	I didn't exercise my legs or my back much, figuring that's what I'll need most this weekend for yard work.
2471	I think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball.
2471	I took an abs class, since I need to get my abs (and back) in shape to protect myself from injury.
2471	I could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus!
2471	The Met was plenty convenient.
2471	They have a spa there now, with all the spa stuff.
2472	No can do.
2472	Thanks anyway.
2473	So when are you leaving today?
2474	Talk to you when you get back.
2475	Pete, These comments are from our Finance group.
2475	These are FYI at this time; further discussions to follow.
2475	Kay
2476	Hi!
2476	I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.
2476	You gotta love President's Day.
2476	We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired today.
2476	I'm too old to go out on a school night!
2476	Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the blockage.
2476	When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.
2476	Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.
2476	Sounds dangerous to me, but I don't really know anything about it.
2476	Too bad about Katie's asthma.
2476	I was worried that Paige has it, but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.
2476	Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze.
2476	I'm not sure of the difference, but I believe this dr.
2476	Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.
2476	We asked this spring and he said not yet.
2476	I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't want to push him either.
2476	Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play.
2476	Maybe we can come watch Annie play.
2476	Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week.
2476	Everything else is business as usual around here.
2476	Say "hey" to everyone.
2476	Love, Kay
2477	I think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to any particular terms in the definitive docs.
2477	I don't see why we would need to DASH exclusivity.
2477	See you soon, Kay
2478	Barbara, Here's the latest word I have on the meeting, which sets it for tomorrow.
2478	Is there something later which sets it for today?
2478	Thanks, Kay
2479	Hi Shirley, Is this meeting still set for tomorrow?
2479	I heard a rumor that it had been changed again, but I don't know if it is correct.
2479	Kay
2480	No problem.
2480	I appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it.
2480	Kay
2481	Bronco is on the sofa upstairs.
2482	Just a reminder.
2483	I think Tuesday, 2/27, looks good.
2484	Hey there, I'm going to try very hard to make it to Dick's farewell party.
2484	Who did the invitations?
2484	It is so clever.
2484	Kay
2485	This has sound...
2486	Hmmm.
2486	Very interesting.
2486	I doubt AIG thinks of itself as being in the middle.
2487	Pop quiz to follow...
2488	Hi there, Could you send me three brochures?
2488	I'm working on getting a couple of friends together for a 2-3 night retreat to LAS.
2488	Please send the info to Kay Mann, 29 Inverness Park Way, Houston, Texas, 77055.
2488	Thanks, Kay
2489	Hey, at least you can sew...
2490	Speaking of tennis, Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play.
2490	Neil said no, since he doesn't know how.
2490	I told him I can play, and now Michael thinks I should play with him, then he will teach Neil.
2490	Very elaborate plan!
2490	Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house?
2490	Can you believe we never broke a window?
2490	We have a detached garage, but the door is metal.
2490	I can't imagine how loud that would be!
2490	I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.
2490	Pushing NEVER helped.
2490	She can swim and ride, so I guess it worked out ok.
2490	She never showed any interest in playing on a sports team, even though she used to go to my softball games.
2490	Whatever.
2490	Time to go home!
2490	Love, Kay
2491	Congratulations on your promotions, which demonstrate that ethical standards (coupled with stubborness) deserve to be rewarded!
2491	Kay
2492	Hi Pete, Here are some comments from GE re confidentiality.
2492	Please hang on to the comments pending further direction.
2492	If you are available today for the conference call, it might be helpful for you to listen in for a while.
2492	If you have a conflict, don't worry about it.
2492	Thanks, Kay
2493	I haven't worked with any workout folks.
2493	Do you know Lisa Mellencamp (in ENA Legal)?
2493	She isn't in that area any more, but she used to be.
2493	She might know the players.
2493	Kay
2494	As I mentioned to Scott, we are engaged in active discussions with PB (on behalf of Co Op City) concerning whether Enron will have any role in the EPC activities.
2494	In light of those discussions, I suggest that the meeting scheduled for today be postponed until after Mark and I speak with PB tomorrow afternoon.
2494	I discussed this with Mark, and he is fine with postponing the meeting.
2494	Thanks, Kay Shelby Malkemes
2495	Hi there, I'm thinking of working out after work - hopefully kind of early.
2495	Ok with you?
2495	I should still be home before 730.
2495	Michael took Bronco to school.
2495	I'm sure he will have him at the CC.
2495	Kay
2496	Well, I told Michael that Bronco could ride in the wagon, so I guess he needs a wagon big enough for Bronco!
2497	I have a new pager, and although I'm not positive I will keep it long term, here's the info: To call by phone and enter a page: 888 710 7935 To send an email message: 8887107935@pagenetmessage.net I'm still trying to figure it out....
2498	I now have a pager.
2498	My number is 888 710 7935.
2498	You can also send me an email at 8887107935@pagenetmessage.net.
2498	Kay
2499	Alas I've been caught.
2499	I am working on a CRRA deal re fuel cells.
2500	You may have seen this...
2501	very interesting!
2502	Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
2502	The problem was, Ford's Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases, was even more expensive.
2502	For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer.
2502	The result is a fine SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content.
2502	This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies.
2502	Both engines come mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.
2502	The new V8 offers copious and refined power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers.
2502	Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing.
2502	Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its "New Edge" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps.
2502	Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone.
2502	Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however.
2502	An all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame design debuts this year.
2502	This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance to 9.2 inches.
2502	At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically improved.
2502	The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering characteristics.
2502	A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling even more, while increasing interior room.
2502	Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002 Mountaineer.
2502	A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment, although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does intrude through the floor.
2502	New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors.
2502	Among the Mountaineer's new safety features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles.
2502	Later in the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac traction/stability control system will also be available.
2502	The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension.
2502	There are plenty of SUVs on the market, but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float your boat.
2503	Hi there, Does anyone have a Finance/Accounting blessed professional services agreement?
2503	Thanks, Kay
2504	I'm worrying again about summer.
2504	Maybe we should check out the Y on Voss to see what they have, if anything.
2504	What do you think?
2505	I know I will be hearing from Gregg about this soon.
2505	Any progress?
2505	Thanks, Kay
2506	Here's the CA you requested.
2506	Kay
2507	Mr. Sorte, Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this confidentiality agreement to your attention.
2507	Regards, Kay Mann
2508	My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent out, and won't be for a day or two.
2508	It can't be sent out until the CA is returned to you signed.
2509	Hi Carolyn, Is this the most current version?
2509	Thanks, Kay
2510	The form we have has this as the first paragraph, which is different from the form attached.
2510	Could you conform the NW one to the form?
2510	Enron North America Corp. (&ENA8 or the "Protected Party") is prepared to furnish [__________________] (&*8 or the "Receiving Party") with certain information which is either confidential, proprietary or otherwise not generally available to the public in connection with: (i) the potential salof one or more of the Protected Party's power plant development projects and/or one of more of the special purpose companies which own such projectsin [states], (collectively, the &Projects8) for purposes of evaluating one or more transactions between Protected Party and * involving the Projects(collectively, the &Proposed Transaction8).
2511	No biggie, and understandable.
2511	When we sell the equipment we structure itlike we did on the CA deal - we sell the special purpose companies that wilown the equipment at the time of sale.
2512	Sorry, I lost track of the versions.
2512	Here are my two questions/comments: What are we gaining or losing by putting a drop dead date of March 2004?
2512	On 2.11, I think relinquishing them from "damage" is broader than it needs to be, since the contract language is "risk of loss".
2512	However, if the deal is that they are off the hook for cosmetic deterioration during storage, I think that can be addressed specifically in the change order.
2512	Kay
2513	Well, maybe it makes more sense to write it like this: (see below)
2514	Hi Karen, Sorry I haven't sent the notice.
2514	Brain cramp or something.
2514	When are you here next week?
2514	Kay
2515	In fact those are the only two days I'm around!
2515	Hope to see you.
2515	I'm in
2516	Hi Steve, I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last draft.
2516	Guess you can say this is a sanity check!
2516	If it looks good to you, then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.
2516	Kay
2517	Bob, My husband and I will continue to keep Michael in our prayers.
2517	By the way, I really appreciate your updates.
2517	I'm eligible to give blood again, so let me know when Michael needs more donations.
2517	Kay
2518	Good afternoon, I'm attaching for your review a revised LOI.
2518	Thanks, Kay
2519	Hi Rusty, Since Carlos is working on the Pontiac and Plano sale, I'm going to forward this to him for his handling.
2519	That way things will stay better organized.
2519	Thanks, Kay
2520	Is the promissory note structure still necessary, given the increase in theHSR threshhold?
2521	My memory has failed me once again!
2522	FYI.
2522	We are staying at the Marriott Sawgrass, or something like that.
2523	I will be in Jacksonville Florida this week negotiating a transaction with New Jersey Natural Gas.
2523	It is a project development deal utilizing fuel cells.
2523	The commercial lead is Jeff Ader.
2523	I will leave tomorrow afternoon, returning on Friday afternoon.
2523	Kay
2524	The dynasty begins....
2525	I have a PSA which needs to be made 97-10/TurboPark compliant.
2525	Could you work on it?
2525	I'll bring it around.
2525	Thanks, Kay
2526	Hi Carlos, Here's the PSA I mentioned.
2526	Kay
2527	hotel info included at the bottom
2528	I think the pager is just too cool.
2528	I don't think Mark has talked to Jeff or Barbara about the move.
2528	Kinda awkward!
2529	No idea.
2529	Whenever he gets around to it, I guess.
2530	Sheila, If you are working on this I think it makes more sense for you to have Ed handle the CA.
2530	I don't want to get in the middle.
2530	Thanks, Kay
2531	Fred, Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen project, and I think the form is in good shape.
2531	However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix.
2531	Does GE know this is coming?
2531	What are you projecting for a closing date?
2531	We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.
2531	Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?
2531	If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.
2531	We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.
2531	In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal.
2531	Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest.
2531	I can get started on the process if you are ready.
2531	If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.
2531	We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.
2531	Kathleen, please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.
2531	Kay
2532	I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.
2532	Thanks anyway.
2532	Kay
2533	Please get with Fred to get something working.
2533	Thanks,
2534	Hi Pete, Can you send me the most recent version of the LV Co Gen facility agreement?
2534	Also, in a separate email could you send me the C of A?
2534	I want to make sure I have the latest, greatest of each.
2534	Thanks, Kay
2535	Fred, Do you have the names/addresses of the interested counterparties?
2535	It saves time to do all at once.
2535	Thanks, Kay
2536	Hi, Has Reggie made any progress on the short file cabinets?
2536	Thanks, Kay
2537	Sounds good.
2538	Hi Chauncey, Are either of the restaurants very formal?
2538	I want to make sure I bring the right clothes.
2538	Thanks, Kay
2539	Here's a new deal for you.
2539	I've got two follow on deals for K & S, so this one might be a good one to use someone else, if you need and want to.
2539	(I hear the rustling of the pines..) Clear outside counsel selections with Jeff, then Mark, etc. Kay
2540	Hi there, Did you come up with a "form" llc agreement in conjunction with the form letter agreement, or is the Coral LLC agreement the latest thing?
2540	Thanks, Kay
2541	Here are my car questions: How much would a tricked out Sequoia cost if ordered from the manufacturer?
2541	Is there a 2000 Escalade available with the cargo doors?
2541	I think I probably want to drive each one more time.
2541	Off to a meeting....
2542	Feast or famine!
2543	If you are available I think it would be a good idea.
2543	No big deal if you can't.
2544	Well, I just don't know what to tell you.
2544	If nothing else I think the ball was punted to the east.
2544	Kay
2545	Maybe this is more like rugby.
2545	I passing the ball to Carlos, who will get with you and Kathleen to figure out what's what.
2546	I set it as my new wallpaper.
2546	The file was too big - SU wouldn't let it come in.
2547	Southwestern University.
2548	I've just learned that this is a "West" deal for the sale of the LV Co Gen units.
2548	This deal was described as being the same as the Intergen deal.
2548	King & Spalding helped me on that one, and when I thought this was an East deal I contacted Keffer for a conflicts check (there is none).
2548	I haven't gone to Mark with it yet, though.
2548	We have forms, etc for this, and I'm happy to provide whatever support I can.
2548	Please advise as to how you would like to proceed.
2548	Kay
2549	more information
2550	Thank you.
2550	This is very helpful.
2551	Please print and fax the redlined version to me at the hotel.
2551	Thanks, Kay ps I'm in room 706
2552	Here's another document I need to have faxed to me: Thanks, Kay
2553	Hi.
2553	Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
2553	Kay
2554	Charlotte, Great story!
2554	Neil is at the Astrodome now.
2554	You might be able to reach him on his cell or by pager.
2554	If I hear from him I will have him give you a call.
2554	I'm in Florida, and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by.
2554	Wouldn't Michael go crazy?
2554	Bye, Kay
2555	I haven't heard back from Dale.
2555	Sheila and I have swapped voice mails.
2555	Kay
2556	Westinghouse has agreed that LJM doesn't need to sign it.
2556	I sent SW a letter confirming that agreement.
2556	Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon.
2556	Otherwise, the agreement is fully executed.
2557	Lynn Dekrey is the guy Mitch negotiated the deal with.
2557	Lynn left me a message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a day we could expect the letter.
2557	I would expect it this week.
2558	Gentlemen, Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?
2558	The munies are specifically citing Section 100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have faxed me an opinion of the Mississippi AG interpreting this section.
2558	If you will email me your fax number I will fax it to you.
2558	Kay
2559	Here's the revised form for the Blue Dog equipment: Kay
2560	Hi Carolyn, Could you check this and see if I did anything stupid with the revisions: Thanks, Kay
2561	Sorry for the delay.
2561	I ran into some complications.
2561	I left it "in blank" so we can fill in the commercial specifics depending on the purchaser, etc. Kay
2562	I did write it for them, and sent it to Lynn.
2562	We are waiting for them to sign it and send it back.
2562	Kay Enron North America Corp.
2563	Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a bit for lessons learned.
2563	I will forward the updated letter agreement which has been improved also.
2563	It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the defined terms are different.
2563	I will also forward the Intergen docs so you can see some of the definitions, etc. One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is exercised.
2563	I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.
2563	I don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.
2563	Kay
2564	See my previous email.
2565	I don't know if this was the final one...
2566	We had to amend the agreements to give us more time.
2566	The new version I sent you fixed that.
2567	As I mentioned, I think the "new and improved" versions are better starting points, but here's what we used.
2567	I don't recall whether the concept of a development fee has been vetted with the accountants, as it wasn't applicable to the Intergen deal.
2567	Kay
2568	I've sent Sheila and Dale electronic copies of the documents.
2569	Hi there, Please look this over, spell check, print and fax two copies to me, as we will be signing this doc this afternoon.
2569	Ciao, Kay
2570	Anyone know any good lawyers in Mississippi, or any lawyers knowledgeable about Mississippi law?
2570	Power background would be nice, but I know that may be too much to ask.
2570	Thanks, Kay
2571	Stuart, If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).
2571	The letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need to sign.
2571	I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I requested it anyway.
2571	Kay
2572	Yes.
2573	Just let me know when you get bored...
2574	Thank you for your helpful comments.
2574	Good points.
2574	On the timing issue, we still have the time sensitivity, but I hate to give it a precise day.
2574	Maybe the way to address that is within 10 BD's, as mutually agreed.
2574	I don't have the doc in front of me (I'm in Florida), but I thought it said ENA was taking responsibility for increases in the Purchase Amount as it exists the date of closing.
2574	I'll check.
2574	I agree with deleting CO definition.
2574	It doesn't add anything.
2574	Again, thanks.
2574	Kay
2575	Greg, I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it.
2575	However, it doesn't answer the question for me as to whether a Mississippi court would uphold such a clause, or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue.
2575	Due to the importance of the issue I will consult with a Mississippi firm to get a handle on the question.
2575	Thanks for your help, Kay
2576	I'm so ready.
2577	Travel plans for Monday.
2578	Hi Leatha, Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade.
2578	We liked it, however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.
2578	I like the extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.
2578	When we asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
2578	They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
2578	When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a third.
2578	So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options.
2578	The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to "work on it".
2578	The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.
2578	I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus.
2578	Thanks, Kay
2579	Rosco was in for his shots today.
2579	On Feb 3 he weighed 14.6 lbs.
2579	He now weighs 27 lbs.
2579	His paws look too big and his head is too small.
2579	What an adventure!
2580	Please find his contact information for me.
2580	Thanks, Kay
2581	Ben, What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?
2581	I had heard a rumor that we were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.
2581	Is this the same deal?
2581	I know on the international side there were hoops to jump through before such an engagement could be signed off on.
2581	I'll have to check to see what the drill is on this side of the street.
2581	Kay
2582	latest on my system, but I'll check.
2583	Hi Cindy, Would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people make their reservations?
2583	I'm thinking maybe ten rooms for May 4, 5, and 6, out on the 7th?
2583	I would like it best if the individuals could call you directly to make the reservation.
2583	How does that work for you?
2583	Thanks, Kay
2584	This is the one I get to go to, right?
2585	I'll check.
2585	Thanks for the help.
2585	Kay
2586	fyi.
2586	Comment?
2587	Have you checked this out?
2588	I have a staff meeting and will be unable to join.
2588	I do plan to be on Friday's call.
2588	Kay
2589	I had to cancel due to my travel schedule.
2589	I have a staff meeting every first and third Wednesday, which I've told Sheila about.
2589	On those weeks I'll miss the call.
2589	Ta ta, Kay
2590	Many thanks!
2591	That is very cool.
2591	Rosco has gone from 14 pounds to 27 pounds in one month.
2591	That's a half a pound a day.
2592	Great trip back.
2592	I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.
2592	Don't make a point of spending your vacation there!
2592	Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy?
2592	I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.
2592	Kay
2593	Hi Marchris, I'm in ENA Legal, and I'm looking for the right person to discuss this with.
2593	Christi Nicholay suggested I get you involved.
2593	Please give me a call at 713 345 7566 to discuss.
2593	Thanks, Kay
2594	They haven't signed the other ones.
2594	We moved the equipment straight out of TurboPark and into the llc, then on the same day sold down the equity of the Please call to discuss at your convenience.
2594	Thanks, Kay
2595	Here are my responses: 1.
2595	Development fee is a commercial question.
2595	This will need to be vetted with Herman if we go with it.
2595	Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next week.
2595	2.
2595	I have a call in to Dale.
2595	3.
2595	No LLC.
2595	Kathleen will handle.
2595	The closer the creation is to the signing of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up.
2595	Someone needs to name it.
2595	We should also look at a minimal list of officers.
2595	4.
2595	I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it up.
2595	I'll get back to you.
2595	The concept is that ENA is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.
2595	I thought the language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed!
2595	As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the definitional questions.
2595	It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract with GE, but I won't make that assumption.
2595	Drop dead date on put/call Dec. 5.
2595	This needs to be discussed with Ben.
2595	6.
2595	This should be set up as a new matter, since these aren't the Blue Dog turbines.
2595	You can send the bill to Sheila with a copy to me.
2595	I'll open the doc and take a look at it asap.
2595	Kay
2596	Re; enovate/Peoples
2597	I heard a rumor that you have TurboPark closing docs.
2597	Could I get a copy?
2597	Thanks, Kay
2598	1988 Jeep Cherokee Laredo, good condition, 4WD, A/C, automatic windows and locks, cruise control, 100,000+miles, will take $2000.
2598	Please call Jonathan at 713-853-7910.
2599	This is who Sheila suggested.
2599	The deal I'm working on is an asset management/control area services transaction.
2599	It will be an odd one, so I'm not expecting someone to have specific expertise.
2599	I need help on the general contracting under Miss law stuff, especially since there are some quirks involved.
2599	Your input would be appreciated.
2599	Thanks, Kay
2600	You know so much!!!!!
2601	I guess someone thought of this again.
2601	I'll wait to see what Ben says.
2601	This is when I'm out of town, which is fine by me.
2601	Kay
2602	Obviously this is going complicate (and increase the cost) of the transaction.
2602	Is there any way to push back on this?
2602	We will now need four break out contracts, four sets of every other document, 4 sets of assigning docs out of TurboPark, etc....
2602	Not hard to do, but a challenge to do on your time frame.
2602	Kay
2603	Chris, Please come see Carlos and I about the transaction.
2603	Kay
2604	Hi Pete, Would it be possible for you to be in Houston this Friday morning for the GE meeting?
2604	It would be great to meet you in person, and have you participate.
2604	What is your availability?
2604	Kay
2605	A treat for you...
2606	An exhibit...
2607	loan amount term (maximum) fixed rate (apr) To 100% of Purchase Price 36 Months 48 Months 60 Months New auto only 72 Months To 90% of Purchase Price 36 Months 48 Months 60 Months New auto only 72 Months
2608	I have a couple of questions.
2608	Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?
2608	Both time frames are mentioned in your explanation.
2608	Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?
2608	Does the cost include the tax trade on the Lexus?
2608	Thanks for your help, Kay
2609	Carolyn, I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate, not takeover.
2609	Please verify with the LV CoGen documents which I forwarded just a few moments ago.
2609	The changes I made to the definitions in the prototype letter were a result of the fact that the Blue Dog contract with GE uses slightly different terminology than the LM 6000 contracts.
2609	We need to revert to the appropriate underlying contract.
2609	Thanks, Kay
2610	It is an hour and a half west of Memphis.
2610	No where.
2610	You can smell the meat processing plant.
2610	Hey, you would probably like that!
2611	900 central, so you should be in decent shape.
2611	Kay
2612	Jeff, Are you up-to-speed on this one?
2612	Kay
2613	This was supposed to be to Jeff and Barbara, but the phone rang.
2613	I can't recall who knows what.
2613	Kay
2614	I hadn't heard the 2 1/2 hour deal, but then again, I wasn't on the call.
2614	I'll check on pushing the meeting back to 930 to give you a chance to get downtown before it starts.
2614	Sheila, what do you think?
2614	Kay
2615	Please call Jake Thomas and Steve Thome in Portland and see if we can have a conference call at 500 Houston time.
2615	Thanks, Kay
2616	Hi Carolyn, In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other thoughts: Letter agreement: I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability.
2616	2.
2616	Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.
2616	2 (a) Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine Contract.
2616	Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.
2616	3.
2616	Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement.
2616	7 (b) does this make sense?
2616	Should we also have the right to specific performance?
2616	9.
2616	(iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement.
2616	Should say by closing such will have been obtained.
2616	I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable.
2616	I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't want to contradict it with the rep.
2616	I'll review the LLC agreement next.
2616	Kay
2617	Good.
2617	I hadn't heard back from them.
2618	Hi Sheila, I don't recall seeing a bill from Bracewell on the VECPCO deal.
2618	Did you ever see one come in?
2618	Thanks, Kay
2619	In case I forget to mention it, when the next round of Panda docs are ready, you might want to send them to Herman and Matt.
2619	Thanks, Kay
2620	Cindy, How long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the charge?
2620	I think your suggestion will work.
2620	Kay
2621	We will be in Bay City on Saturday, but I don't know if it will be overnight.
2621	Mom
2622	Ben and I can make it.
2622	Kay
2623	I'll be available, and will let you know how it goes.
2623	Kay
2624	Before you send out the next draft we need to talk briefly.
2625	Please put on my schedule.
2626	Dale, Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?
2626	If so, it would be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.
2626	That way, we only have to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask him to sign.
2626	Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the pages?
2626	That helps, too!
2626	Kay
2627	no headaches
2628	I don't know who started the initialling kick, and I don't know if I care if it continues.
2628	I don't know if Lee cares.
2628	It is probably an EECC artifact.
2628	If GE doesn't care, then I don't care.
2628	( I hear strains of a show tune "I don't care, I don't care").
2628	I think I've lost my mind.
2628	Kay
2629	Carolyn, Please use NewCo instead of Spawn.
2629	Also, please give them only one business day to review the final facility agreement.
2629	Also, we need the duplicate forms for Sunlaw Energy Corporation.
2629	Will we be getting the drafts tonight?
2629	Please call me if you have any questions.
2629	Thanks, Kay
2630	No big deal.
2630	I'm just trying to tie up loose ends when I can.
2630	I suspect they must have gotten paid, or else someone would be complaining.
2631	I made a couple of minor revisions.
2631	Jake has given us until when he gets in tomorrow.
2631	I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.
2631	Perhaps it it redundant.
2631	I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.
2631	Maybe we can discuss in the am.
2632	Sorry to hear about Bobby's wreck.
2632	I hope he feels ok tomorrow.
2632	Neil's number at work is 713 596 8716, and his email is nmann@erac.com.
2632	I know you probably checked this, but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance under your auto policy?
2632	Always good to check.
2632	Paige got a kick out of seeing Bobby.
2632	I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine.
2632	I feel the same about going up next week.
2632	There will probably be a more appropriate time later.
2632	Paige is coming home for SB next week.
2632	I suspect she'll come Friday or Saturday, but don't know for sure.
2632	We are probably going to the Matagorda livestock show and auction this weekend, and maybe the rodeo.
2632	It must be good - like the Belton rodeo.
2632	Hi and hugs to all!
2632	Love, Kay
2633	I like this one.
2634	I know you wouldn't forget, but Ms. Bills will need to be advised.
2634	See you tomorrow.
2634	Kay
2635	We are in the process of refining the form in connection with the left coast transaction, and it will be easy to "de-westify" it.
2635	Kay
2636	I didn't ask for the conference call, but I wil make time in my schedule to participate.
2637	It is the last two weeks of school, I believe.
2638	You have correctly identified my financial advisor, although I figured this one out by myself.
2638	I think I'll join the credit union!
2639	Chris, Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this, since this is in TurboPark.
2639	Kay
2640	Here's the latest drafts: Kay
2641	Hi there, I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with the Intergen closing list.
2641	We can get organized on putting together a package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow agreement, etc. Thanks, Kay PS.
2641	You might want to check the docs I sent out to Jake to make sure I didn't put a Panda in a Delta doc.
2641	I checked, but I need to be double checked.
2641	Another good reason to use XYZ's until the finalist is selected.
2642	I think what I will do is send out an email today to have people call you directly and reserve a room.
2642	We can then see how many short we are, and deal with the deposit.
2642	I will tell them to inform you that they are with the Enron group.
2642	Names of the individuals should be as follows; Kay Mann (I'll call with my card soon - I want the Premier) Heather Kroll Barbara Gray Peggy Banczak Lisa Bills Rose Engeldorf Nora Roberts Anne Koehler Lisa Mellencamp Christi Nicolay Gail Brownfeld Maybe this will help identify those who are REALLY in. There may be a couple of new ones also.
2642	Thanks, Kay
2643	Thanks so much for your help.
2644	Lv Co Gen deal.
2645	funny, she didn't ask me!
2645	$25 never hurts.
2646	Atta girl.
2646	You should have heard Ben complementing you to Jeff.
2646	Ben said he wished you worked for him so that he could participate more in your PRC review.
2646	The point was not lost on me!
2647	Neither have us have spoken to GE.
2647	I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't know the substance of the conversation.
2647	We asked his permission on the Intergen deal, I believe.
2647	I told Jake last night that there are arguments which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having the contract distributed to a potential partner.
2647	He said he wanted to talk to you about it.
2647	My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.
2647	That is the most conservative approach.
2647	Kay
2648	Time for a battle field promotion.
2648	I'll be Tanto, you can be him that sabes.
2649	Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.
2649	I know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.
2649	I think a casual conversation will work.
2649	The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD ramp rates sometimes matter.
2649	Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it will be a big issue.
2649	Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors are, that might help.
2649	Kay
2650	Hi Gregg, I spoke to John N, and I think I understand what's up.
2650	I'm in a conference call, but will holler later.
2650	Kay
2651	This confirms our agreement we reached today that we will start the meeting at 930am Central.
2651	Kay
2652	Aren't you something.
2652	From now on, you are Mr. PSA.
2653	He did go out of his way to sing your praises, so job well done.
2654	Scott stopped me on 31 to tell me what a good job Carlos did.
2654	Thought I would pass it along.
2654	Kay
2655	Please put the Friday GE call on my calendar, as well as a 200 call tomorrow on Northwestern.
2655	Thanks!
2656	Nothing from Leatha.
2656	Any news there?
2656	Kay
2657	Hi Jeff, I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding, so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.
2657	Sheila suggested this firm, and Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.
2657	As you can guess, it is a short list in Mississippi to chose from.
2657	Please let me know what you think.
2657	Kay
2658	The document on the bottom is the one you are looking for.
2658	I will send one of the exhibits separately.
2658	Kay
2659	Thome, Sole - hey, that rhymes...
2660	You can run but you can't hide!
2660	Kay
2661	Here's more for you to enjoy.
2661	We need to make this into an XYZ form to match up with the letter agreement.
2661	Thanks, Kay
2662	This is the turbine contract to print and put on your desk.
2662	Kay
2663	Having fun yet?
2664	I am attaching the final form LOI between ENA and CRRA, as well as the current working draft of the Fuel Cell purchase agreement.
2664	Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.
2664	Kay Mann
2665	He doesn't know that Sheila undermined his authority with his client, and intervened.
2665	Remember her saying she wasing going to stay out of it?
2665	Just shoot me if I do that to you.
2665	Or at least kick me.
2665	Kay
2666	It has now clicked that you were looking for a letter in addition to the settlement letter.
2666	That didn't sink in before.
2667	Here tis
2668	Frightening roster.
2669	No action required, fyi re: Blue Dog (the East deal) and Project Salmon (the West deal).
2670	And a tough crowd it is.
2670	I'm up for it.
2670	He seems genuinely happy for you.
2671	You are destined for political greatness.
2672	Please print the clean version below.
2672	My computer won't let me print - I tried two different printers.
2673	Attached is the Blue Dog LLC agreement:
2674	This time I mean it:
2675	Please print the form agreement.
2675	I think it is the fourth one below.
2676	I had coconut cream pie for lunch (also tuna).
2676	I feel so guilty.
2676	Light dinner for me.
2676	And maybe a vodka (NO WINE).
2676	If I can get time to call Nathaniel, I will.
2676	I'm in a conference call now.
2676	I feel guilty about being gone Sat.
2676	night if Paige is home for SB.
2676	It does sound like a good weekend weatherwise.
2676	I can check with her to see her preference.
2676	Kay
2677	I need staples and the stiff green folders.
2677	I forget what these are called.
2677	Thanks, Kay
2678	I think you'll find there isn't that much to a site sale.
2678	Witness Plano/Pontiac as compared to the Peakers.
2679	Don't forget that Herman reads everything, and to ask Fred if this deal will be DASH'ed.
2679	(I don't know if it should, but probably so.)
2680	I would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through Herman.
2680	There may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what gets booked on mark to market basis, etc. He may have absolutely nothing to add, but I wouldn't take the chance.
2681	Do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow.
2681	Look forward to meeting you, Kay PS.
2681	Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come.
2681	Sheila really wanted you there.
2682	Attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi.
2682	I'm expecting a call from David Hunt, so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet.
2682	The Beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally, but since we haven't, I'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements.
2682	Kay
2683	Hi Marisa, Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the same forms.
2683	Obviously, we want the economy of doing this once for both transactions.
2683	Also, please bill the time for these forms to Carlos' deal, since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement and the llc forms.
2683	It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the structure is agreed I would keep the letters in as place holders.
2683	Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will have the certificates.
2683	Thanks, Kay
2684	Hi John, I asked to have ONE guaranty prepared and ONE escrow agreement for Carlos and I to review the forms.
2684	Now I've got two sets of docs sent by two K & S attorneys.
2684	Additionally, we are drafting against ourselves.
2684	The letter agreement and the LLC have been given to the counterparty.
2684	Seems to make more sense to wait for comments.
2684	HELP!!!
2684	Kay
2685	Please print.
2686	fax for car loan 713 345 3555 My contact is Ms. Sammy Marroquin.
2686	Borrower is cynthia kay mann.
2687	We have an agreement which resides in TurboPark.
2687	Kathy Clark did the contract.
2688	This was the emergency.
2689	The outside lawyer for Northwestern, Marguerite Kahn, would like to speak with you concerning the structure of the LLC, specifically including the promissory notes.
2689	Guess I didn't explain it all that well.
2689	I asked her just to call you directly, and gave her your number.
2689	Thanks, Kay
2690	Turbine Team, For future reference we should add in the put/call language (similiar to the language in 6.2 (c) of the Intergen deal) which allows Enron to put the equity to the buyer at any time GE consents.
2690	We should soften the approval rights of the purchaser.
2690	Thanks, Kay
2691	Please don't.
2691	I enjoy the laughter!
2691	I was just jealous.
2692	Ann Elizabeth, Can you handle this?
2692	This is another Florida lobby deal.
2692	Kay
2693	Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.
2693	I'm with you - go Delta.
2693	Who wants to mess with the broker issue?
2693	Ciao, Kay
2694	Hi.
2694	I'm interested in joining.
2694	What do I need to do to join?
2694	Thanks, Kay
2695	Please check the cancellation policy for next week's seminar.
2695	I may not be going.
2695	Thanks, Kay
2696	OK.
2696	I'll let you know tomorrow.
2696	I'm leaving at 330 to take Michael for a check up.
2696	Routine.
2696	Kay
2697	Any idea what will be on the agenda?
2697	It would be very nice if they would respond to the drafts we've sent them.
2697	Kay
2698	We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.
2698	Any suggestions?
2698	Kay
2699	I'm calling in (conference call) for this one.
2700	Hi Ed, I can't find (or recall) that I received the subsequent email referenced in this email.
2700	Can you direct me to the right place?
2700	I looked under Administrator and Legal Net X, and all my emails from 3/8.
2700	Thanks, Kay
2701	I kinda like Coyote LLC and Black Hills LLC (no spruce).
2702	yes, thanks.
2703	Hey guys, PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.
2703	Lisa has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose Engeldorf.
2703	Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be back in the office tomorrow.
2703	We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through the issue.
2703	As for the "standard" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.
2703	Carlos has recently worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance blessing.
2703	He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could also add some extra insight.
2703	When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to discuss it.
2703	Kay
2704	Hi Randy, Just wanted to let you know what it up on CoOp City.
2704	I don't know the agenda for the meeting.
2704	I'm planning on calling in. Kay
2705	Hi John, I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.
2705	Do you have someone available?
2705	I need input by Monday, March 19.
2705	Nothing comprehensive, just a fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.
2705	Thanks, Kay
2706	Hi Jeff, I don't know if you are picking up email, but just in case, here's a description of the Roundtable.
2706	Kay
2707	John, I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress with the site beyond permitting.
2707	As you know, there is no going back once we give up that optionality.
2707	Good catch, Renee.
2707	Kay
2708	Hi there, Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets?
2708	I want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.
2708	Thanks, Kay
2709	Here's the thing I'm doing on Thursday.
2709	Do you have a form of bio for anybody around here?
2709	I need to make something up for the paper.
2709	Thanks, Kay
2710	John, I've received internal approval to participate.
2710	I'll see what I can come up with for a bio.
2710	Thanks, Kay
2711	Well, you know Enron.
2711	No boredom, ever!
2711	Kay
2712	Well, I'm glad I get to edit!
2712	Not really.
2712	Mark approved it this am.
2712	Hopefully, good publicity which will make Mark glad he approved it.
2712	They usually take pictures to go with the article, so I have to see if I need a new, clean, white shirt.
2712	Gotta look good!
2712	Makeup and everything.
2712	Wonder how I lose 15 lbs by Thursday?
2712	Kay
2713	I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.
2713	Supposed to rain this weekend anyway, so Monday is soon enough.
2713	I would just as soon not have a Sharon appointment so we have that flexibility.
2713	Plus, there is the possibility that I might need to go to FW for my dad.
2713	Michael can go to FW with me if I need to go - he would be great company for me.
2713	I've thought about taking him to Moody Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.
2713	The long term weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that week, but you never know.
2713	I don't mind taking him by myself.
2713	I can do most of the fishing stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.
2713	If I do go I would like to take Rosco.
2713	Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up with a little work and write you, too.
2713	What do you think?
2714	Hi Chris and Ben, Wanted to make sure you had seen/approved these.
2714	I'm looking now also.
2714	Kay
2715	For your info.
2716	Thought you might find this interesting, in some sick way!
2717	Just a reminder that I am planning on being on vacation with my son next week.
2717	My clients are aware of these plans, and I have hopes that things will go without a hitch.
2717	I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail.
2717	Kay
2718	Well, I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco to aim at.
2718	I guess Kaley will have to growl at Jack just to stay in practice.
2718	I should add that Kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something urgent comes up, I could have to cover for Carlos.
2718	Not likely but you know how the baby stuff goes.
2718	I think Rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although I don't have any information to go on.
2718	You mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so I guess we should expect him to be big.
2718	Maybe one of those tall Labs.
2718	I just hope his personality stays the same.
2718	Kay
2719	My dad is having some health issues, so they couldn't commit to next week.
2719	I cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth, so please take the steps necessary to call that off.
2719	Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to cover for him.
2719	We'll see.
2719	I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc. In other words, no big plans, which I'm happy about.
2719	I think Neil will miss Rosco as much as Michael, but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a few days.
2719	Kay
2720	Pitiful!
2720	Charlotte confirmed for today?
2720	Delmis is cleaning as we write - I spoke to Paige.
2720	She is going to try to get an appt with Cher for cut/color.
2720	I told her we would buy.
2721	Do you have the GE contracts in the CA stuff?
2721	Thanks, Kay
2722	It seems that I remember seeing something about this in the Titan claim file.
2722	Maybe a copy of it?
2723	FYI, one of my guys got a call from one of your band of merry men concerning selling the 7EAs.
2723	Kay
2724	Hi Cindy, Any more sign ups from Enron?
2724	I'm thinking of sending a reminder out in the next day or so, and I wanted to see if you have anyone other than me, Heather and Anne.
2724	Thanks, Kay
2725	I guess Ed Hearn.
2726	Dear Mr. Keffer, Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate person with the Astros organization.
2726	In keeping with our family tradition, I am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a "behind the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.
2726	This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an honor to be a part of it.
2726	Any assistance you can give in putting me in touch with the right person would be appreciated.
2726	Sincerely, Paige Record
2727	Please see insurance groups' request re: equipment warranties.
2727	One alternative is to send equipment contracts to David Marshall for his revieKay
2728	hi back
2729	Reagan, Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache.
2729	Don't worry, I'll do the legal work!
2729	Kay
2730	Anytime in the next hour is good, since I didn't eat breakfast.
2730	I would love a caffeine free Diet Coke.
2731	Got it.
2731	Good hint!
2732	Thanks John.
2732	I got a huge kick out of Paige struggling with the email to you.
2732	She's a terrific writer, but had horrible writer's block.
2732	I think it was the dose of reality which comes from looking for a job.
2732	Kay
2733	Hi, I saw your posting concerning the kayak.
2733	Do you still have it?
2733	Where is it located?
2733	I may be interested.
2733	Thanks, Kay
2734	Details.
2734	Do they want one of the turbines before Sept?
2735	Did you look at it on the website?
2735	It looks like fun.
2735	Michael and I could probably have fun on the quiet water days.
2735	I'll need a ladder, so I'll have to break the news to Pop Pop.
2735	Kay
2736	Maybe on Saturday.
2737	I'm still on it.
2737	We are still working on the term sheet.
2738	No. We can talk about it when you we meet in a little bit.

2740	Life's pretty tough when your mom (opps, he calls me "Mother" now) won't let you watch tv on the way to school!
2740	You guessed right, I really enjoy our time together in the am, and I don't want to compete with Pokemon.
2740	Kay
2741	Great.
2741	We would like to take a look at it.
2741	Sounds like something fun for our family.
2741	I'll call to set up a day/time, if that's ok with you.
2741	Kay
2742	For calendar.
2742	I may go straight there in the am.
2743	Are you available?
2743	I thought you might be interested since DDuran will apparently be there.
2743	I'm scheduled for vacation.
2743	I'll arrange an invite if you are interested.
2743	Kay
2744	Sounds like a family man.
2745	How's the weather?
2746	Attached is a general bio.
2746	Please let me know if you need something different or additional.
2747	I sent it to J. Cogan, but I can send it to other folks as well.
2748	I think he will absolutely love it.
2748	Our wedding is at 4, but we can bring him over earlier if that helps with the museum trip.
2749	OK.
2749	Enron North America Corp.
2750	I need to have a form filled out that says I don't have health insurance coverage through Enron.
2750	Can you find out who I need to send it to in HR?
2750	Thanks, Kay
2751	I have a change in plans next week.
2751	My dad is having surgery in Ft.
2751	Worth, so I will be heading that way on Monday.
2751	I was planning to be on vacation anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft.
2751	Worth which I would not have had otherwise.
2751	I will manage client expectations accordingly.
2751	Kay
2752	I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal.
2752	Is that ok with you?
2753	Yes, but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood to the brain.
2753	Big deal kinda stuff.
2754	For better or worse, all the folks under the heading "Origination" and "Development" are ours, although Kathleen has a special role with Development.
2754	Kay
2755	Peggy Banczak is the ENA lawyer who handles Mexico.
2756	Hi Wilson, I spoke with David Hunt, and he has no problem with you representing Enron Power Marketing in the proposed transaction with Clarksdale and Yazoo City.
2756	Please let me know if you have any other potential conflicts.
2756	Thanks, Kay Mann
2757	Look at you.
2757	More work!
2758	I'll have to send the notice separately.
2758	John's number is 713 751-3254.
2758	Kay
2759	I believe this to be the applicable assignment language.
2759	I'm confirming.
2759	Kay
2760	Hi Rose, Was the Blue Dog override letter signed for TurboPark?
2760	I didn't see it in the TurboPark closing docs.
2760	Of course, I could have missed it.
2760	Thanks, Kay
2761	Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy.
2761	My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.
2761	She has a cough that just won't quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.
2761	I think it is her heart.
2761	She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.
2761	Rosco owns the familiy now.
2761	He is so quiet, but friendly.
2761	Just likes to hang around close to everyone.
2761	I'll miss him when I'm in FW.
2762	I took her in a while back for the cough, plus she goes in every 6 months for kennel cough and hearworm test.
2762	They haven't said much and I haven't asked.
2762	Afraid to, I guess.
2762	I got Kaley when I was with my former boyfriend, and she's been through it all with Paige and me.
2763	Needs to be vetted with Herman at some point.
2763	If Jake wants to negotiate something else with GE, I'm all for it.
2764	You lost me.
2764	We talked to Jake about it, and the two issues were GE consent and accounting treatment.
2764	At least that's how I remember it.
2764	Kay
2765	I didn't redact it, but Ben might have a copy.
2765	I can email you the electronic file of the intact document.
2766	We are also working on a couple of change orders.
2767	Hi Janette, If the tickets are still available, I would love to have them.
2767	I realize I was a little slow on the draw this time!
2767	Thanks, Kay
2768	My guess would be the week of the 4th of July, then again sometime in August.
2768	I agree that he really should see it.
2768	If you want to take him, that's great, or we will be glad to take him.
2768	Kay
2769	Big surprise!
2770	You're on.
2770	He's getting to be such a good age for theater.
2771	Wow.
2771	That was quick!
2771	Now I'm out of excuses...
2771	Kay
2772	I figured it was a long shot.
2772	Have a great weekend.
2773	Hi Pete, There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project.
2773	We are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines.
2773	Sound familiar?
2773	Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent.
2773	I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the "new" Salmon contract.
2773	I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with.
2773	Carlos Sole is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.
2773	His number is 713 345 I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice mail if you have any questions.
2773	Thanks, Kay
2774	As mentioned in my other email...
2775	Ok, by now you think I've lost my mind.
2775	I can accept that.
2775	I believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the Salmon LLC contract (formerly known as LV Co Gen facility agreement).
2775	Kay
2776	Jake is ready to tell Lee who the purchaser is and get permission to "tell all".
2776	I think that's a good way to go.
2776	I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine contract.
2776	I will be glad to do it if you want.
2776	Jake said that Bill Williams had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments were no longer germane.
2776	Bill has received their comments, but I don't know his reaction.
2776	Kay
2777	Thanks for the quick turnaround.
2777	Kay
2778	Don't be too grateful.
2778	I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what.
2778	He obviously values your opinion.
2778	My personal opinion is you put the comments in front of Lee, and if he doesn't like them, the answer to Delta is no, we have no leverage to get your changes.
2778	Kay
2779	Is that a general offer to help, or just an offer to help me find the Blue Dog contract?
2780	Kathleen, We need to set up an LLC for the Blue Dog turbines.
2780	Chris had proposed some names at some point, then Ben had come up with something.
2780	I now can't remember what it is.
2780	Anyway, it needs to be on the list for next week.
2780	Thanks, Kay
2781	Hi John, Sounds like we are now reunited in the same legal group, EWS.
2781	True?
2781	Kay
2782	I really like that one.
2783	Well, welcome to EWS.
2783	I like Mark Frevert, and I've heard good things abouGreg Whalley.
2783	Also, I like working for Mark Haedicke.
2783	Kay
2784	Reagan, I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.
2784	I will make the changes you and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime today.
2784	Kay
2785	Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.
2785	That's what comes to mind at this point.
2785	Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)?
2785	Thanks, Kay
2786	I don't have any significant comments, but I picked up a couple of minor typos.
2786	From a structure standpoint, I think Enron doing the construction (and taking price risk) may be a structuring challenge, but I understand that's a bridge to cross later.
2786	Kay PS I hope Mark isn't reading this today!
2786	Great wedding.
2787	Reagan, I don't suggest it, especially since this is not an "off the shelf" deal.
2787	There are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long run to get someone else involved for a few days.
2787	It is like getting a new commercial guy involved for 4 days.
2787	I'll defer to the great and powerful Oz.
2787	I should be available most of the day, so let's see how things go.
2787	Kay
2788	Gee, I was kinda hoping we would have the opportunity to dump stuff on EEOSnot the other way around.
2789	Please confirm that Beck's comments nos 1 and 6 are acceptable for the loi.
2789	I would include in this email, but I don't have an electronic version with me.
2789	Reagan, if you have an electronic version, could you forward it to me?
2789	Thanks, Kay
2790	I cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received.
2790	Yikes.
2790	Sounds like Neil still has a chance for a new shirt.
2790	We'll have to allow extra time next Monday for a double de-brief.
2790	Kay
2791	Reagan, FYI, it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel.
2791	If you want me to call David, just ask.
2791	I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest bugging the other parties' counsel too much.
2791	It uses up relationship capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want to incur.
2791	Another FYI - I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.
2791	It violates Enron policy.
2791	So once we have outside counsel on board, you still deal directly with me, and I'll manage the outside resources.
2791	It really works better that way.
2791	Kay
2792	Don't mean to lecture, especially via email.
2792	Just trying to give some constructive suggestions!
2793	Sheila, If I were starting over again, there are a few things I would change.
2793	First, the development fee as presented in this draft doesn't work.
2793	Second, I would put all the put/call details in the llc agreement.
2793	Third, I would make the put/call available anytime GE agreed to it.
2793	The development fee has been discussed generally, but not fully vetted with Herman.
2793	Kay
2794	Here's a general description of the steps: Letter agreement signed Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC) $ deposited in escrow TurboPark notice given Closing date: TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption) LLC signs breakout contract Amended LLC, other closing docs executed Money released from escrow to Enron Enron pays off TurboPark This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.
2794	I was unsure from your email if you see a problem with this process.
2794	Kay
2795	Well, there's a little lesson in the value of being polite to EVERYONE.
2796	Hey Andrea, We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his carotid arteries.
2796	I'm kinda nervous about this one.
2796	Everything else is going well.
2796	Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.
2796	Paige has applied to the Astros for a summer job.
2796	Seems like a long shot, but she really wants to do it.
2796	Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters.
2796	His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.
2796	Unfortunately, I haven't met him yet.
2796	I can't wait to hear about your reunion.
2796	I know it will be a blast.
2796	Have fun!
2796	Kay
2797	I sure hope it is this week.
2797	It will either be this week, or a while.
2797	How's that for keen analysis?
2797	It would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by E Next, we should use the break out form, plus an override letter.
2797	What do you think?
2798	Attached for your reading enjoyment is an indicative org chart.
2798	As you might guess, there have been some changes since this was published in December.
2798	Kay
2799	More org stuff.
2799	Randy must now be with EWS Legal, since I see he is in an office on 38.
2799	Kay
2800	Nothing is simple.
2801	Ben, I will try to be on at least part of the phone call on Thursday, technology permitting.
2801	Kay
2802	FYI.
2803	I'm working at home today, headed to Fort Worth tomorrow.
2803	I spoke to Carlos shortly after you were up there, and he mentioned you were looking for an org chart, and he recalled that I had sent him one.
2803	Kay
2804	Every day?
2805	Carlos and I are discussing options right now.
2806	I like it....
2807	Sorry I didn't come up with more concrete examples.
2807	I'm really concerned about my dad, although I try to deny it.
2807	I still think that we should insulate ENA on the next deal.
2807	Kay
2808	I heard a rumor that Carlos Sole has been tasked with the Mitsubishi consent.
2808	I'm sure he will do a great job.
2808	Kay
2809	Hi Carlos, I should be easy to reach on my cell until around 930 Tuesday.
2809	Feel free to call.
2809	In my absence you can feel comfortable talking to Jeff.
2809	He seems pretty reasonable and easy to talk to.
2809	Plus, he knows a lot about Enron stuff.
2809	You will want to discuss the risk memo with him, copying Sheila I guess.
2809	Ask Jeff.
2809	Like I said before, I'll back you up on whatever decisions you make, for whatever that's worth.
2809	My folks number (just in case you lost it) is 817 292 3367.
2809	Ciao, Kay
2810	Did I send this to you yet?
2811	I'm out of pocket the rest of the week.
2811	I think the best description is the general Enron Corp description.
2811	It is very generic, and is found at the bottom of all Enron press releases.
2811	If I get access, I'll forward it to you - unfortunately I can't access it now.
2811	It is one of those "Enron is a leading blah blah blah" things.
2811	Lots of help I am!
2812	I know you don't have enough to do...
2812	I can't access the press release part of the Enron intranet site.
2812	There is a blurb that appears at the bottom of all Enron press releases, which is one of those Enron is a leading blah blah blah.
2812	If you can easily find that blub, would you mind forwarding it?
2812	Sorry for asking.
2812	Kay
2813	Here is the current draft for your review.
2813	In addition to the changes which were made, there were some valid comments made by Beck and Christi, which I think need to be addressed, but can be addressed in the definitive agreements.
2813	Please revise carefully and let me know if you have any comments.
2813	Kay
2814	Jeff, It looks like Ben has made some good progress with GE re: Blue Dog turbines.
2814	This really helps.
2814	As you can see, I now have email access.
2814	Kay
2815	I've spoken to the Brunini firm in Jackson.
2815	Kay
2816	FYI.
2816	Please call me on Monday to discuss, if possible.
2816	Thanks, Kay
2817	I'm out of town, but can donate next week.
2817	Kay
2818	First order of business.
2818	Again, we can discuss this on Monday.
2818	I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a telephone call today.
2818	I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.
2818	I really hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.
2818	Talk to you Monday.
2818	Kay
2819	As best I can tell it isn't essential; however, it would probably be helpful.
2819	I know you are on holiday, so if you have something else going on, I wouldn't worry about it.
2819	I can always call you later.
2819	Kay
2820	We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.
2820	I've been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop and who hasn't.
2820	However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to make sure you are aware of the deal.
2820	It is the commercial teams desire to enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.
2820	Sorry for the short notice - today is the first day I've been able to pick up my email.
2820	Kay
2821	Hi Dan, What's the latest with Suzanne?
2821	Is she home yet?
2821	Do you have her home Thanks, Kay PS I'm still out of town.
2822	Thanks.
2822	We'll call you around 100.
2822	Kay
2823	Chris, Please do not ask outside counsel to participate in a call, undertake a task, or do anything without talking to me, Carlos, or another Enron lawyer first.
2823	You do not need to call Carolyn and tell her not to participate.
2823	Carlos has taken care of this already.
2823	Kay
2824	Will there be a "pre-call" for the Enron team?
2824	Kay
2825	I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.
2825	Did your CA get taken care of?
2825	You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.
2825	Do you have electronic copies of the development agreement?
2825	Thanks, Kay
2826	I saw that Michael Young was included in the email regarding the 100 conference call, so I thought he was planning on phoning in then as well.
2826	When will he be calling in?
2826	Kay
2827	Hi John, I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.
2827	Let me take a look at the agreements first, before we commit.
2827	Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?
2827	He might have copies, and he won't charge us for them.
2827	At least I don't think he will.
2827	Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.
2827	Kay
2828	That will help.
2829	Evidently Ben told Chris to call.
2829	This is an on going problem.
2829	Kay
2830	Sounds perfect.
2830	Unfortunately, Bart works on West deals.
2830	I'll talk to my boss (Jeff Hodge) and see what he says.
2831	Hi Bart, I think it is an East deal, so I wouldn't think it would be dumped on you.
2831	I just think it is nice to see the good stuff.
2831	Kay
2832	Please put Carlos Sole on the notice list.
2832	Thanks, Kay
2833	Hi there, Feel free to leave me an email about anything you are working on, as I will be available next week and onward to cover for you.
2833	In fact, if you want to stay home and go with KS to her dr's appt on Monday, I'll be there to cover.
2833	In fact, just PLAN to not be there, and if you are, it is a bonus.
2833	I don't you worry about anything when it gets to be baby time.
2833	If you do figure out remote access, I can email you questions and you can answer when it is convenient.
2833	Paige is almost 21, Michael is 6.5.
2833	It goes fast!!!
2833	Ciao, Kay
2834	my cell phone is charging, give me 30 minutes.
2835	John or Marissa, please call me at your convenience on my cell, 713 304 8716.
2835	Thanks, Kay
2836	FYI.
2836	I don't know what I think about this email.
2836	I will say that I've heard good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.
2836	Also, there is a big difference between a transmission project and a power project, since tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint.
2836	Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.
2836	Kay
2837	Hi there, Just confirming a 200 CST Enron team conference call.
2837	Is this going to work for everyone, with the exception of Carlos, who is now excused?
2837	Kay
2838	Opps.
2838	I should add that Mr. Hodge has a free pass to miss this and all other NW phone calls.
2838	Kay
2839	Ben, I'm at home if you need to reach me before the call, 713 973 6325.
2839	Kay
2840	So how do you say "bitch" in Spanish?
2841	I have a better chance of remembering "mamona".
2841	I have to build up to the good stuff.
2841	My home number is 713 973 6325.
2841	If call notes picks up, try me on my cell at 713 304 8716.
2841	Did you find the fax?
2841	You can fax it to me if that speeds up you getting out of the office.
2841	Call and let me know.
2841	Thanks, Kay
2842	Unless something new comes up, I think we finished the letter agreement.
2842	I'm awaiting a revised draft now, and if it is acceptable to NW, they will sign it and fax it to me tomorrow morning.
2842	Maybe on Ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here from a schedule standpoint.
2842	Talk to you tomorrow, Kay
2843	I'm looking at it now.
2844	The changes look fine to me.
2844	Kay
2845	Wonder how much worse it would have been if we had started with a doc that you and I liked.
2846	John, Thanks for driving in to the office so you could send these emails.
2846	Don't forget to mail the hard copy.
2846	I appreciate your help.
2846	This deal will need it.
2846	Ciao, Kay
2847	Hi Bob, Any info?
2847	Kay
2848	Hi Reagan, Sure.
2848	I'm digging out now.
2848	Kay
2849	Kathleen, Carlos has Illinois, so keep him copies please.
2849	Kay
2850	Thank you so much.
2850	I'm really looking forward to seeing the Rangers, and what a great place to see them.
2850	Kay
2851	Works for me.
2851	Kay
2852	Suz's temporary replacement can't find the Matagorda Fair receipts I left for Suz.
2852	We may been to call to get duplicates.
2853	I thought about you every day, but I figured you'd be better off with peace and quiet.
2853	My dad is doing fine.
2853	He is very relieved to have it over with.
2853	Last week was just nuts.
2853	Are you still in a lot of pain?
2853	It takes a while to get your strength back, so don't push it.
2853	Your body has a lot of healing to do.
2853	Aren't you glad you used the Torso Track so that you had decent abdominal strength?
2853	It is amazing all the things you use those muscles for.
2853	I can't tell you how much I miss you.
2853	Take care, and I'll write if there's any good gossip.
2853	Kay
2854	What's your phone number?
2855	Wilson, Please call me when you have a minute.
2855	Thanks, Kay
2856	Could you re-send that summer camp website address?
2856	The one I got on the page didn't work.
2856	Thanks, Kay
2857	It was operator error.
2857	Do you know the hours of summer camp?
2857	I put a call in to ask, just in case you didn't know.
2857	I kinda like the Methodist angle, and the swimming pool.
2857	He needs more swimming lessons.
2857	Kay
2858	hours are 7-630, program runs 9-4.
2858	Maybe we should try church there.
2858	I found the receipts.
2858	We should have taken the forms with us to the auction to save time.
2858	Oh well, live and learn.
2858	Pork chops and spinach?
2859	Gentlemen, Attached is a clean version of the LOI.
2859	Originals are being sent to Bob and Marvin by FedX tonight.
2859	Regards, Kay
2860	Let's see if I get your address right this time....
2861	I was wondering what I was going to do in my spare time!
2862	Good morning, How about 130 today for a conference call with John's new best friend?
2863	I'll leave that up to you.
2863	We can make faces and pass notes if you come over, but I suppose that isn't essential to the transaction.
2864	My recollection is that the original ABB contract was assigned into TurboPark without revisions/restatement/consent, or a break out contract.
2864	I think EECC had the typewriter on the original contract.
2864	I quickly looked in my TurboPark binders, but didn't immediately find the ABB contract.
2864	There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.
2864	It wasn't approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC post TurboPark.
2864	I wasn't involved in the Fountain Valley transformer contract, but my guess would be that Pete Thompson worked on it.
2864	The footer you described sounds like an AK footer.
2864	Kay
2865	Pete, Please send John Schwartzenburg a copy of the Fountain Valley transformer contract.
2865	Thanks, Kay
2866	Right.
2867	I'm thinking MK may not be email proficient.
2867	Also note WordPerfect documents.
2867	I bet her secretary had to come into the the office on Sunday.
2868	Are these ok with you?
2869	These are both pending, but just so you know they exist, I'm sending this along.
2869	Once these are signed I'll send you copies.
2869	Kay
2870	I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants.
2870	Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power development projects easier.
2870	In the past, we ran into problems anytime we wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.
2870	Herman tells me that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.
2870	This change in focus should make power development deals easier to structure.
2870	I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose Engeldorf.
2870	Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.
2870	A meeting with Herman would also be helpful.
2870	Maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him on these new developments.
2870	Kay
2871	Thanks for the reply.
2871	I found it on her desk!
2871	Kay
2872	Tonight is yoga night.
2873	much grass
2874	Whichever is better for Charlotte.
2875	for your information and email folder
2876	Hi Karen, Sounds familiar.
2876	I'm sure you checked this, but in some of the GE contracts, the parent guarantee provision is under the purchaser's responsibilities section, near the beginning of the contract.
2876	A strange place for it.
2876	Good luck, Kay
2877	Hi Wilson, Can you open this attachment?
2877	Kay
2878	Michael is off school April 13 and 16.
2878	I have 3 deals which are supposed to close around then, so I'm not optimistic.
2878	If possible, I will take at least one of those days.
2878	On the summer camp, if we use a camp by you, we will probably lose Charlotte for the summer.
2878	Does that matter to you?
2878	Kay
2879	Remember the count down!
2880	Suitable for printing.
2881	I'm not aware of an override agreement with ABB.
2882	If someone can give me the name and address of Montana Power, I can finish the exclusivity agreement today.
2882	Kay
2883	I agree it is Matt, and I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at least other turbine K's) before.
2883	His concern will be us getting some amount of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).
2883	Obviously, he might have some other comments as well.
2883	I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe he can access the site?
2883	Kay
2884	I got this from Carlos from a deal he and Carolyn have worked on.
2884	Note that the language sounds familiar.
2884	Someone must have sent this form to NorthWestern.
2884	I suspect an Enron person.
2884	Kay
2885	I didn't know there was one.
2886	Well, Ben's POA is executed, it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's for the subs worked out.
2886	Come see me whenever you want.
2887	I haven't read this, so I don't know if it is anywhere close to your deal, but here's a bootleg copy of the Frontera agreement, just to give you a sense of some type of starting point.
2887	Kay
2888	Here's a draft for your review.
2888	We should talk about the generator before this is sent to MPC.
2888	Kay
2889	Yes and no.
2889	They were supposed to call at 5am to see if they should come in at 700 (space permitting).
2889	If no space is available, they are to go in at noon.
2889	I'm guessing they went in at 7, since I think he would have called to say they haven't gone in. Just a guess, though.
2889	He has his computer at home, so I think if he was sitting around he would drop us a note.
2889	Kay
2890	I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.
2890	Is there another day?
2891	We need to cancel Michael's appt with Sharon for that Monday.
2891	Also, why don't you try to find at least 2 people to go with you to the Astro's game on Tueday.
2891	I'll come if I can.
2892	I'll nose around here.
2893	Here's the form of LOI I was thinking of using, in draft form.
2893	I don't know how much information we are prepared to fill in on the term sheet.
2893	If we don't have enough to fill in we can always skip the term sheet for now.
2893	Kay
2894	Per your request.
2895	Good.
2895	Does that mean I'll see you there?
2896	When you get a minute please send me your favorite option agreement so that I can get it Hermanized.
2896	Thanks, Kay
2897	No room at the inn for today and probably not tomorrow.
2897	Carlos says he will be here tomorrow unless something happens tonight.
2897	Kay
2898	You shouldn't have told Ben.
2899	Hi Carlos, Jake called and said he wants to sign up Delta tomorrow (Friday).
2899	I had a conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing forward.
2899	If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues.
2899	Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on the structure?
2899	I'll get up to speed on this during the evening, and will take your deal toy when the deal is done.
2899	Kay
2900	John, Note their lawyers are Paul Hastings.
2900	We need to take that into consideration.
2900	Kay
2901	Excellent observation.
2902	Is this for the turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new replacement equipment?
2902	Thanks, Kay
2903	What do you think of this?
2904	Thanks!
2905	FYI.
2906	Well, things are hopping around work!
2906	Dan and I have barely had time to say hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.
2906	I've got several deals going great guns, so you know how that goes.
2906	I had lunch with Stuart and Kathleen today, and that was fun.
2906	Neil and I have a date night tomorrow, so we are trying to decide what to do.
2906	I suggested we just walk around the downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.
2906	I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.
2906	I'm going to tell Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave me alone.
2906	I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.
2906	Neil gets to go with me, which is really nice.
2906	It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a neat time.
2906	Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will be setting as the game ends.
2906	I'm glad baseball season is back, although I did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.
2906	Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the hospital so she could be induced.
2906	Texas Women's was too busy to take them.
2906	They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will have a late night.
2906	You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.
2906	I keep hoping to have an hour to bring it by.
2906	I figure it will be good no matter when you get it.
2906	My transfer to Power Trading is back on.
2906	I think some of the work I do is transferring with me, but I'm not sure.
2906	In short, I don't know what the difference will be.
2906	It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving it too much thought.
2906	Elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar - this one in Newport Beach at the Four Seasons.
2906	I'm liking the sound of it!
2906	I miss you terribly, as does Neil.
2906	Take care and get well quickly.
2906	It isn't the same without you!!!!!
2906	Kay
2907	Hi there, I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main one.
2907	I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in this deal for a little while.
2907	Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks ago.
2907	Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in the pack with the current ones.
2907	I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss it with him, just to make sure he is on board.
2907	I know it can be done, we just have to figure out the paper trail.
2907	Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.
2907	Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.
2907	Talk to all soon, Kay PS.
2907	Anna Claire Sole arrived at 200am today.
2908	Hi Pete, I have a fire drill for you.
2908	This contract needs to between Salmon Energy LLC and GE, with no agency reference.
2908	In other words, a CA Development form.
2908	Any chance of getting this today?
2908	The delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing, as is the payment schedule.
2908	Also, the designation of one of the turbines will change.
2908	Salmon will be receiving units 19, 20, 23 and 28 (a new one).
2908	Thanks, Kay
2909	I don't know why I have trouble with your email address.
2910	Hi again, I'm going to have some tweaks on the letter agreement, but please go ahead and distribute to Delta for their review.
2910	Thanks, Kay
2911	Yes.
2911	How's that for an answer.
2911	I think you want to revise against this version, since this is the latest version Lee has seen, then blackline against the 20th version.
2911	THANKS!!!
2911	Kay
2912	Did you mean for your home number to be on the out of office message?
2912	Kay
2913	Just go ahead and turn it, putting in a [Note:] for any missing pieces.
2913	That will make it easy for me to search.
2913	Thanks, and have a good weekend.
2913	Kay
2914	Most recent version.
2915	Becky.
2915	I had four days of vacation, March 19, 20, 21, 22.
2915	Thanks, Kay
2916	Stephen is trying to set up a conference call at 200 re Delta.
2916	Please advise if this doesn't work for you.
2916	Thanks, Kay
2917	Have I written you back yet?
2917	It is such a zoo, I can't remember.
2917	I've started this email 3 times.
2917	I'm going to the Astros game on Thursday in the Diamond seats.
2917	I'll watch for Ric.
2917	Both Neil and I will be there.
2917	I love those seats.
2917	That's where I'm sitting on opening day, also.
2917	I'm sure you will be at a game soon.
2917	Remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games?
2917	It is no nice with the roof open.
2917	How many games do you have tickets to this year?
2917	They have James Coney Island outside today.
2917	I ate most of two hot dogs.
2917	I bet I'll be sleepy soon.
2917	I brought them back up here, so my office will probably still smell like chili when you come back.
2917	Guess I'd better get back to work.
2917	Rest up and get well.
2917	Kay
2918	Chris Calger wants the financing CP removed, and we have a call scheduled at 200 to see if we can get to agreement with Delta.
2919	4.
2919	If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with thpurchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and thisAgreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of ENAreceipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any furtherliability of either Party to the other hereunder.
2919	If, during the Term, ENAdetermines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the sale of theTurbine due to circumstances relating to the generator, it shall notify MPCand refund the Consideration.
2920	I got a form that consultants sign, and I'll compare them.
2920	Kay
2921	Larry left me a voice mail.
2921	Would you mind calling him and telling him that I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so I can't call him until after then.
2921	I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!!
2922	I'm on a conference call which I hope will end by then - a deal we are trying to close today.
2922	YIKES!!!!
2922	Kay
2923	I would guess "yes".
2923	I don't know that I like the idea either.
2924	I feel bad.
2924	I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend.
2925	I'm on the phone with Mark H. (the big guy)
2926	I would love to take you up on it, but I'm already lined up to go.
2926	I'll take a raincheck!
2926	Thanks for thinking of me.
2926	Kay
2927	I'm an expert at being a rabid fan and excellent arm chair manager.
2927	I keep waiting for the Skipper to call for advice....
2928	We are trying to close with Delta, and they saw a March 20th draft.
2928	Also, I had it revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc.
2928	So now I have two versions.
2928	Just trying to get it clear.
2928	I've spoken with Lee about revising the contract to pick up the new contract, leaving the "old" turbine in the master agreement, to be included in the LV Co Gen break out contract.
2928	Couldn't be simpler.
2928	Kay
2929	You have excellent sources.
2930	You might check to see if this looks like the one in the binder.
2930	I believe it is one and the same.
2930	Kay
2931	Hi Lee, Here is the new turbine contract, blacklined against the March 27 version.
2931	I look forward to speaking with you soon.
2931	Kay
2932	I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some of the blanks.
2932	I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the purpose of running the comparison.
2932	The notes included are placeholders since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap.
2932	GE is also reviewing Salmon Energy Agreeement version 2.
2932	redline Thanks, Kay
2933	For your reading pleasure.
2934	Hi there, I suggest that we have an Enron only call at 230 central on Sunday, in advance of the 300 call with Delta.
2934	I believe the call in number is 877 232 0064, pass code 25581#.
2934	Kay
2935	Comments from Enron Finance.
2936	I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it is a deliverable.
2936	The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel.
2936	To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the Pastoria deal.
2936	It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it will smooth over quickly.
2936	More to come.
2936	Kay PS.
2936	Still no comments from NorthWestern.
2936	We need to talk about how scheduling problems Easter weekend if this thing drags on.
2937	I agree.
2937	They are really taking their time.
2937	It makes me think that they would sign up as is.
2937	What an optimist!
2937	Kay
2938	is this your flight?
2938	Have you seen your ticket?
2938	It isn't in my name, is it?
2939	Wow, you are up early for a man of leisure!
2939	Kay
2940	That's my One Pass number.
2941	Here's the latest revision of the Delta letter agreement.
2941	I'm reviewing it now.
2941	Kay
2942	I wouldn't call them until after you've taken the flight!
2943	Hi Kent, I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are working on.
2943	We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.
2943	Three of the turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.
2943	In any event, Delta Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the attached documents.
2943	Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the attached.
2943	I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy anyway.
2943	Thanks, Kay
2944	Hi Karen, Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for Pastoria?
2944	We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.
2944	Thanks, Kay
2945	Hi Pete, Are the performance numbers the same as the original master numbers?
2945	I recall some email traffic on this.
2945	Thanks, Kay
2946	I didn't tell them, so the rumor mill must be working.
2947	That sounds really interesting.
2947	Let me see if I can change one appointment to make it work.
2947	Thanks, Kay
2948	I guess go back to the original contract performance numbers.
2948	The other numbers must be specific to the site for the Las Vegas project.
2948	Kay
2949	I would think the policy would still be in place, but I don't remember what it is.
2950	Units will be 19, 20, 23, 28 (no serial # on 28).
2950	I think the amounts and pricing stays the same.
2951	Carolyn and/or John, could one or both of you give me a call as soon as you are available for a conference call with Chris Calger, Steve and me.
2951	Thanks, Kay
2952	Hi Danetta, I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.
2952	I know that you recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain Valley transaction.
2952	I'm happy to serve up those forms to Freshfields if that makes it is easier for you.
2952	My number is 713 345 7566.
2952	Thanks, Kay
2953	Anything else for the term sheet?
2953	Feel free to add it and return to me.
2954	Here's what GE is signing up for this week.
2954	I would like to see their opinion letter.
2954	Kay
2955	We have a conference call at 200 with Delta.
2955	If you are interested in returning to the deal you are welcome to jump back in. I suspect the letter agreement will be signed sometime this week.
2955	With closing to occur later this month.
2955	It is up to you.
2955	Kay
2956	Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank.
2957	No problem.
2958	Danetta worked it for the Fountain Valley project.
2958	How long has she been here?
2958	I didn't know there was anyone other than you.
2959	Sheila handled FV.
2959	Today was the first day I had seen them.
2960	Hi Chip, Have you seen anything from Hancock re Delta?
2960	I haven't.
2960	Thanks, Kay
2961	We are going to hold the limits the same in this contract, and take the extra on the purchase on the replacement equipment.
2961	Kay
2962	The issue is getting an assignment agreement that GE will sign.
2962	I've requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most recent GE frame assignment transaction.
2962	That should be our starting point.
2962	Kay
2963	Opps.
2963	No, I don't have anything yet.
2963	I got a message from Ben 2 hours ago that said to hold off on Montana Power.
2963	Did you hear differentlly?
2964	Hi Lee, I haven't checked to see if the PS Stabilizers are included.
2964	How does this look?
2964	Kay
2965	This will be yours when you get back - same counterparty as Tex Mex, I think.
2965	I'll finish this and forward you some other docs.
2966	You may have these for Tex Mex.
2966	John expects to use something similiar on the coal plant, but obviously that is up to you.
2966	Kay
2967	New and hopefully improved version, changing confidentiality and the statement in the term sheet on structure.
2967	Kay
2968	I'm ok.
2968	Theresa Zucha has generously offered to help me with my expense account, which I really wasn't comfortable asking Warren to do anyway.
2968	Thanks for asking.
2969	How does Wednesday look for a conference call?
2969	Kay
2970	Ben called this am and said we can go ahead.
2971	I remember that the longer I played softball, the bigger the women were.
2971	When I was in my late 20's and early 30's, I played men's league, and I think they were smaller than the women!
2972	I had a momentary lapse.
2972	Too many turbines, not enough time!
2973	Carolyn, Please send to the counterparty (subject to further Enron review).
2973	I suggest a conference call with Delta at 100 to discuss where we are.
2973	Kay
2974	Hi Wilson, It would be great if we could talk this week.
2974	I'm under the gun right now, but will you be available on Friday for a chat?
2974	Thanks, Kay
2975	Well, you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters...
2976	I thought you were supposed to have your toes in the sand in Florida.
2976	I'll have to check with Kathleen on the details of the documentation for the various development companies.
2976	If there are a couple most active we can put those on the top of the list.
2976	Kay
2977	Lets at least get the Florida ones done.
2977	Any idea why she didn't go?
2978	Attached is a slightly revised turbine contract.
2978	The performance values have been modified, as I believe the previous draft had site-specific numbers.
2978	It is redlined against the version you received last Friday.
2978	Kay
2979	Please see the two additions below.
2980	Hi Rhett, I'm working on one of these turbine transfers via the sale of 80% of the equity of the LLC.
2980	I'll forward the operative docs to you right away.
2980	In any event, here's a change the counterparty wants to the tax language in the letter agreement.
2980	Kay
2981	Here's the letter agreement I referenced in my other email.
2981	Kay
2982	Hi again, Delta Power will be making revisions to the LLC for tax purposes.
2982	I've given them your email address to include you in the distribution.
2982	Kay
2983	Absolutely.

2985	Not that this is a big deal, but I heard a voice mail from Mark stating that Lance is the DASH guy while Mark is in DC.
2985	Maybe that was deal specific.
2985	Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs.
2985	I am underwater.
2986	I'm swamped.
2986	I got up at 430 to work this am.
2986	Got here at 7 yesterday so I could go to the game.
2986	Those young uns recover quickly, don't they?
2986	Still missing you, Kay
2987	Warren helped a little yesterday, and Theresa has offered to do my expense account.
2987	I'll limp by miserably until your return.
2987	Kay
2988	Maybe Mark doesn't know about Lance's trip.
2989	I don't think so.
2990	It would help if you could take a quick look at these few changes.
2990	Kay
2991	Hi Lee, Can you confirm that the retention amount for the "old" turbines?
2991	I've got $705,200 per.
2991	Thanks, Kay
2992	Best wishes!
2993	Hi Carlos If things aren't better next week, I may need ask for your help (ie, dump this).
2993	It depends on how Delta and Yazoo City shake out.
2993	Hopefully, it won't be too bad.
2993	Be sure to check out the black line.
2993	Kay
2994	We have a conference call at 300, and you are welcome to join us!
2995	Hi there, Could someone email me the latest version of the AIP?
2995	Thanks, Kay
2996	Never mind.
2996	Lee sent it.
2997	I hear your deal blew up.
2997	What happened?
2998	Hi Jeff, I'm tied up on an endless phone call, but wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I got your voice mail, and will get back to you shortly.
2998	Kay
2999	Steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach.
3000	I'm checking with Steve.
3000	Thanks, Kay
3001	Hi Carolyn, I can't recall whether Delta et al have seen a draft of the escrow agreement (and instructions) yet?
3001	Is this one in the works?
3001	I suspect GE may want to see it in connection with the giving of their consent.
3001	Thanks, Kay
3002	Hi Pete, Per my voice mail.
3002	Kay
3003	Here's a starting point.
3003	I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.
3003	I'm really unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.
3003	Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.
3003	Kay
3004	I've sent a draft to you and Reagan via email.
3004	There are questions and blanks in it.
3004	Kay
3005	Well, don't get too excited until you read it.
3005	There's lots of stuff I just had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in. Kay
3006	It is good airplane reading.
3007	#2 sounds like the CA Development structure to me.
3008	I don't really like the organization of it much.
3008	I think things need to be moved around and re-organized.
3009	Looks like our exposure is less than $25,000.
3009	Please call me.
3009	Kay
3010	See you there.
3011	Wrong week - that's next week!
3012	Maybe he cancelled this week since he is out next week.
3013	I need a legal opinion.
3013	What is a non-purchase order?
3014	Could you please email me what we think are the execution version of the letter agreement and the substantially complete llc agreement?
3014	Also, how many execution copies will we have?
3014	Thanks, Kay
3015	Hi Charlotte, Just confirming that you will be picking Michael up today, and I will pick him up at your place around 615.
3015	He has clean clothes to change into.
3015	Thanks, Kay
3016	oh boy
3017	It may be closer to 630.
3017	Is this still ok?
3017	I'll call first, of course.
3018	Hi Lee, Pete Thompson is preparing the LV Co Gen break out contract based on the version generated last week that you and Bill Williams had agreed to (or so I think), but incorporating the AIP stuff where approproiate for the new turbines.
3018	We need to have the Delta break out contract signed by April 11th, so I'm hoping to have the LV Co Gen contract today or early tomorrow for all to review.
3018	That way, you can look at both at the same time, and sign both at the same time.
3018	Pretty nifty!
3018	Thanks, Kay
3019	re: Coal fired plant we discussed with Mitch and John.
3020	Hello there, Here's the LV Co Gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines, including the 3 turbines from the new order.
3020	I haven't quite figured out the route, but I think this is the correct destination.
3020	Due to the Delta schedule, it would be very helpful to get closure on this form by April 10th.
3020	Kay
3021	This is the form which needs to be cleaned up.
3021	I may have a cleaned up version.
3021	I'll check.
3021	Kay
3022	Roger Ondreko left the company (or is leaving soon).
3022	Herman brought Billy Flemmin (sp?) yesterday, and Billy seems to be involved in a bunch of stuff.
3022	Your tax guys are Matt Gockerman (state) and Rhett Jackson (federal).
3022	Kay
3023	I didn't pick this email up until this am, and I don't have the beginnings of the 2nd draft with me.
3023	Will DF be in today?
3023	Kay
3024	Deborah, This is the most recent email I have from Mark.
3024	It gives an overview of the project.
3024	I'll check for other pertinent emails.
3024	Kay
3025	Any ideas?
3026	Thanks, Kay
3027	Nice touch, sending this the day after the letter agreement was signed.
3027	Can you enlighten me on the ENA procedures and sensitivities to these types of docs?
3027	Thanks, Kay
3028	I believe he is going to Reliant.
3029	They have a financing out in the letter agreement.
3029	We have to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver GE consents, but I don't recall anything about in other financing docs.
3029	Is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer?
3029	Kay
3030	Here's a new one.
3030	Kay
3031	Christi, per your email.
3031	Kay
3032	I would really appreciate your advice.
3032	I have to learn it somehow, and I know that you have an excellent idea of what works.
3032	Thanks, Kay
3033	Hi Tax Gurus, Here comes another turbine transaction similiar to CA Development and Salmon Energy.
3033	This one is with NorthWestern.
3033	I need to run some tax stuff by you, so here 'tis.
3033	Thanks, Kay
3034	Hi Kent, I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be redlined against.
3034	I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel opinion.
3034	Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.
3034	Thanks, Kay
3035	2nd try.
3035	Hope it works.
3036	We are supposed to try to have the break out contract by April 11, and I think the consents and stuff that same week.
3036	Kay
3037	Final version agreed to by April 11th.
3038	I had to leave early Friday to pick Michael up, so obviously, today (Monday) is fine.
3038	I appreciate your advice, especially on the opinion.
3038	Thanks, Kay
3039	The balance due to GE is being escrowed at closing, with standing instructions to release payments to GE on a fixed payment schedule.
3039	I will email you the current draft of the instructions.
3039	Kay
3040	Hi there, I decided to work from home this am due to a headache.
3040	Kay
3041	They've asked for much the same from GE.
3041	Kent is reviewing the docs.
3041	I'm at home with a sinus headache, but I'm working.
3041	Kay
3042	Hi Reagan, Could you locate, cut and paste and email me the definition of "native load" from the Entergy tariff?
3042	I need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point.
3042	Aren't we missing some time in the defns of On/Off Peak that you gave me.
3042	Aren't 2 hours missing?
3042	Is on/off peak an everyday thing, or seasonal?
3042	What are we going to do about defining profit (and costs)?
3042	Do we need to give a place for meetings, and if so, where should these meetings be?
3042	(13 c).
3042	More to come...
3042	Thanks, Kay
3043	Would you mind faxing me the schedules you emailed me last week?
3043	713 973 0287.
3043	I'm not hooked up to my printer, and it isn't working so swift, and I would like to be able to look at everything at one time.
3043	Kay
3044	Would you rather do lunch tomorrow?
3045	My computer is plugged in to my phone line so I can sit on the bed and work.
3045	I feel puny now, but maybe I'll feel better later.
3046	How do you feel about making Enron an advisory member of the Marketing Committee?
3046	I'm concerned that we will run afoul of Miss law regarding control.
3046	Would this create a problem for us?
3046	Kay
3047	Big hole in the doc without the profit stuff.
3047	Any ideas?
3048	I'm sure Friday will work well.
3048	It should be quiet at work since it will be Good Friday.
3048	I know your pictures will be spectacular.
3049	Christi is the one who told me to ask you about native load since you have the tariff.
3049	Small world.
3049	This is getting tricky.
3049	We could ask Oz but I wouldn't want to upset DF.
3049	It just seems like a big deal to leave out of the draft.
3049	Kay
3050	my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the reorganization.
3050	Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have the last).
3050	Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.
3050	I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.
3050	Don't get discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the changes are in my head.
3050	It won't take too terribly long now.
3050	I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move around the doc.
3050	I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of commercial terms included.
3050	Stranger things have happened of course!
3050	Many thanks.
3050	Kay
3051	I heard Pat Radford is leaving, and you know Bob Carter is leaving, right?
3052	I don't feel as bad as I did when I woke up.
3052	My face hurt so badly.
3052	Neil was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths.
3052	It really helped.
3052	I'm running a low grade fever, and I know it is a sinus infection.
3052	I took a really hot shower around 5 this morning, but it didn't help much.
3052	Advil helped!
3052	I spent a lot of time outside yesterday, and I'm paying for it.
3053	I figured you knew, but I thought I'd better be certain.
3053	I'm wondering about Bart, too.
3053	Bob said he (Bob) is getting a nice raise, and I heard he got a signing bonus.
3053	Oh, I heard it from Dan,, so you probably know.
3053	Are they looking for someone to replace Pat?
3053	I like Glenn, the temp on 31 who was working for Ben.
3053	I don't know his skills, but he is great on the phone.
3054	PP will own 80% of SE, Enron owning the remaining 20%.
3055	DAMN.
3055	I hate it when I do that!
3056	This is a BIG deal!
3057	Let's see if I can attach it this time.
3058	I'd better ask Delta on that one, since there is a financing involved.
3058	I believe PP to be a wholly owned sub/project co, but I'll confirm.
3058	Kay
3059	Would it help if I found the name of some finance contact at Delta Power?
3059	Kay
3060	Hi Carolyn, GE has asked for an explanation of the relationship of Pegasus to Delta Power (in other words, the equity structure).
3060	Could you please ask Greg if DP can send an email with that explanation, so that I can pass it along to GE.
3060	Thanks, Kay
3061	Carolyn, Please make arrange for distribution to the Delta team.
3061	Thanks, Kay
3062	Carolyn, Please send GE's comments to the Delta team.
3062	Thanks, Kay
3063	Thanks, I'll pass along your comments.
3063	Kay
3064	I think I'll just take off until you get back!
3065	I checked with Chris earlier today and he hadn't heard anything.
3065	The ball is clearly in their court, so I guess we just stand by.
3065	I plan on being back in the office tomorrow.
3065	Talk to you then, Kay
3066	I should be in the office in the am.
3067	Actually you picked a good week to make the transition since we'll be at the law conference Wed-Friday.
3067	You can ease into things again without us hovering.
3067	Kay
3068	Steve, I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal.
3068	Please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out contract.
3068	Thanks, Kay
3069	What a mess!
3070	CC, Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?
3070	If so, it would be great it you would contact them directly.
3070	The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.
3070	I expect that it may well be ready tomorrow.
3070	I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.
3070	Kay
3071	Hi David, Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.
3071	I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.
3071	It just seemed that it would easier to work with in the exhibits.
3071	Kay
3072	Does Bill know this?
3072	Lee is going to want to know that you guys are on the same page.
3072	Kay
3073	Pete, Could you call Bill and discuss?
3073	Thanks, Kay
3074	What is wrong with these people?
3074	Who faxes?
3075	Chris, I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing.
3075	We are finishing up the break out contract with GE, and assuming we tender it tomorrow, they will have until April 19th to fund the escrow.
3075	Kay
3076	Sounds like both need to stabilizers.
3076	Kay
3077	Jerry, I didn't receive the fax you referenced yesterday.
3077	Please resend to me at Kay
3078	I was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant to discussions we had last Friday) My point on the fuel plan was that Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.
3078	There is language in the contract addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.
3078	Kay
3079	English as a second language?
3080	This will be a big help, thanks!
3080	Kay
3081	Even then we could send faxes to the right numbers.
3081	This is ridiculous.
3081	Tick tick tick.
3082	Isabel, If you will email me your contact info, I will pass it along to GE.
3082	Thanks, Kay
3083	Did you ask Lee for a finance contact?
3083	I can't remember.
3083	Kay
3084	Team Salmon, Carlos will be working the Enron consent/opinion docs.
3084	I suspect he is looking for a seat at the closing dinner, but the help is appreciated regardless of motive.
3084	Carolyn, the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine.
3084	I spoke with GE about the turbine contract, and I am optimistic that we will have the "final form" today.
3084	Ciao, Kay
3085	Thanks.
3086	Fine by me.
3087	John, The fax is coming in as we speak.
3087	Guess it takes a while to fax it to all those addresses.
3087	Would you mind call Jerry Jerry BoBerry and see what he will tell you is the substance of their issues, and share with him our issues.
3087	I don't see a reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience.
3087	Thanks, Kay
3088	It finished arriving around 1100 cst.
3088	Thanks, Kay
3089	Of course, this doesn't apply to any funds held in a jointly owned bank or trust account, right?
3089	And when you say "do not", what do you mean?
3089	Does that mean do or does it mean not?
3089	You are confusing me.
3089	What does "is" mean, after all?
3089	As I'm sure you recall, Bob Vote handled the last one.
3089	Richard Sanders is the EWS litagation manager, so Mark would probably like for him to know about it.
3089	Richard seems decent.
3089	Kay
3090	You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.
3090	Kay PS.
3090	Please tell me you shared this info with Rob W.
3091	Depends on how much time you give me.
3092	I have a 300 meeting, so I'm sending this as is so that David can print a copy.
3092	I have not yet integrated all of his changes, although I have dealt with the profit/savings and QSE.
3092	Is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the Scheduling (aka QSE) stuff?
3092	Later, Kay ps Reagan has the latest exhibits.
3093	When we were part of Julia's group, waivers of consequentials in CA's were not standard.
3093	I don't know if this was due to an ENA policy (doubtful).
3093	If we are the one giving important information, we shouldn't want to waive it automatically, because consequentials will be the most likely result of the other party's breach.
3093	Therefore, in unilateral agreements where we are giving the info, I wouldn't want the waiver.
3093	In the reciprocals it would depend on the circumstance.
3093	If the other party is doing most of the sharing, I would want it.
3093	What say you, Carlos?
3093	Kay
3094	Wow.
3094	I wonder how long it will take for me to get a good handle on this stuff?
3094	Thanks, Kay
3095	I have a few comments from our finance folks which I am reviewing now.
3095	Kay
3096	Cool.
3097	Believe it or not, they have not mentioned an extension.
3097	They figure we can sign on Friday.
3097	When do you want to talk?
3097	Kay
3098	Scott, Carlos Sole' is supporting Mitch and John's efforts relating to BPUB, ie, coal fired generation.
3098	Any contracts for that effort should be coordinated through Carlos.
3098	Carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and accounting requirements.
3098	Due to the complexity of the issues some lead time is necessary.
3098	Unfortunately, there are no "forms" for generation projects (given accounting/finance requirements), or any assurance that a contract that worked a month ago will work now.
3098	My preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ENA (or EECC) Legal review.
3098	Thanks, Kay
3099	Cynthia Kay Mann I approve invoices and work from remote locations.
3100	yeah yeah yeah
3101	I'm back.
3101	Last night my little boy was sick, so I guess it was a virus.
3101	I feel good today.
3101	CA time.
3101	Kay
3102	Thanks!
3102	Kay
3103	Welcome back.
3103	I know you are probably really busy.
3103	Paige will be coming home on Thursday.
3103	I told her we might not be leave for PH until Saturday.
3103	I want Michael to be able to go to the Easter egg hunt here if he wants to.
3103	I don't know Paige's plans beyond Thursday.
3103	Since you've been out of town so much, would it help if I took off Friday so that you can catch up?
3103	That still leaves Monday.
3103	Glad you are back!
3103	Kay
3104	I love free stuff, even agreements.
3104	Any calls from 33?
3104	Kay
3105	for your info
3106	Hi Tax Gurus, I was out when you called the other day.
3106	Since then, we have another version of the docs anyway.
3106	Would you like to schedule a time to discuss this with me and outside counsel?
3106	Kay
3107	Monday is bad for me.
3107	The rest of the week looks good.
3107	Kay
3108	Hi there, I thought I'd check back to see where we are on the Delta (Salmon) break out contract, now that we know that the stabilizers should be included.
3108	How's it looking?
3108	Thanks, Kay
3109	Are you and Herman ok with this?
3109	Kay
3110	Hi Herman, This is another turbine transaction.
3110	I think there will be another turn of this doc soon, but I want you to have a heads up.
3110	Kay
3111	Are you in the loop on this?
3111	Kay
3112	Hi Wilson, I haven't forgotten you, I just got tied up.
3112	This is a very preliminary draft, but thought you should take a look at it.
3112	I don't need a detailed analysis, I just want you to have it so that we can discuss the impact of Mississippi law.
3112	I am specifically interested in discussing the following: waivers of consequential damages, limitations of liability legal status of MDEA (I'll send you the info of what I have) dispute resolution and jurisdiction restrictions on confidentiality restrictions any other aspects of the agreement impacted by Mississippi law I don't need any memos, just a discussion.
3112	Thanks, Kay
3113	yep
3114	Me again.
3114	Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.
3114	I believe we need to restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.
3114	Thanks, Kay
3115	GE has been negotiating with Freshfields (just like you will be soon) so I don't know what the current version looks like.
3115	Kay
3116	Again, Kent is negotiating this directly, so I don't know what the current version looks like.
3116	Kay
3117	I'll forward your email to Neil.
3118	Thanks for writing - I deleted your message and then hopped on another conference call.
3118	How about 330?
3119	Here's some stuff for us to discuss.
3119	Kay
3120	Want to join me?
3121	It isn't necessary unless you want to.
3122	This is the first of two emails I'm sending you.
3122	Lee revised the Salmon contract you did, and now it needs to be "unrevised" in these ways.
3122	Kay
3123	Thanks, Kay
3124	Sounds good to me.
3125	Do you want to come to my office for the call?
3125	If so, could you PLEASE PLEASE bring me a caffeine free diet coke?
3125	Thanks, Kay
3126	Hi Ben, The conference call went fine with NorthWestern.
3126	They really want to get their hands on the contract and the change orders.
3126	I told them you were talking to GE about it, and we will get them the contract ASAP.
3126	Here are the issues: If we terminate due to their default, they want the additional $5m to be liquidated damages (ie, our exclusive remedy).
3126	They still want the right to talk to GE, specifically about the terms of the assignment to the LLC if we are having difficulty getting GE consent.
3126	They want to be able to exercise their call (or take an assignment) of the turbine contract earlier.
3126	They are willing to take the risk with the GE warranties.
3126	This is a relationship issue.
3126	It is also their biggest issue.
3126	On an interesting note, Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer of all the equipment to Sweetgum.
3126	Do you know if Lee knows about this?
3126	Ciao, Kay
3127	This is preliminary.
3127	I'm supposed to get with our finance folks tomorrow to get it finished.
3127	This is ok to send to NW with that understanding.
3127	Kay
3128	Good morning.
3128	Please call these folks and see if you can set up a meeting of the East Development team either Tuesday or Wednesday: Ann Elizabeth White Carlos Sole Kathleen Carnahan Barbara Gray Jeff Hodge The meeting shouldn't last more than 45 minutes.
3128	Please reserve us a conference room on this floor.
3128	Thanks, Kay
3129	I think Lima would make a great bobble head.
3129	You better get there early.
3129	I received an email from Alfons telling me he was resigning from Technip.
3129	I'm clueless why he sent it to me.
3129	Talked to Gerry last week.
3129	He says he is going to put his Kingwood house on the market.
3129	Hmm.
3129	I hear lots of the old gang is working with him now.
3129	Have you gone to your reunion yet?
3129	How was it?
3129	Gotta go home but I didn't want to not write back today.
3129	Hope you find all your Easter eggs.
3129	Kay
3130	This SHOULD be it.
3130	Please circulate, including Lee.
3130	Thanks once again, Kay
3131	Hi Warrren, Could you please print all of these attachments for me?
3131	Thanks, Kay
3132	I hope this is the last version.
3132	Stay tuned!
3132	Kay
3133	Nothing from Ben yet.
3133	If I don't hear from him in the next couple of hours, then I think we should be ready with an extension letter, giving them a couple of days extra for free.
3133	Ben indicated to me last week that he would give them some time once they asked.
3133	MK called with questions on the assignment - nothing serious.
3133	Kay
3134	Just in time for the weekend.
3134	I hope to take tomorrow off, by the way.
3134	Paige is coming in tonight, and Michael has the day off from school.
3134	Kay
3135	Maybe having 2 kids and an SUV makes you feel older.
3136	I'm tellling everyone that I'm taking off tomorrow.
3137	Does that mean we will do the pre-pay?
3138	Me again.
3138	I forgot to ask you to look at 4.7, 8.3 and article 6 of the LLC agreement.
3138	Just want to check.
3138	Kay
3139	I don't know either.
3139	Kay
3140	I'll look but nothing comes to mind.
3141	These are the current drafts, not the ones I sent earlier.
3141	Kay
3142	We are getting close on this one relating to the Blue Dog turbines.
3142	I'm reviewing these drafts in detail, and expect that there will be another turn.
3142	Just wanted to give you a heads up.
3142	Kay
3143	Carolyn, I think we should tender by email.
3143	Kay
3144	Thanks for all your efforts, and consistent responsiveness.
3144	I hope you have a great vacation.
3144	Kay
3145	I've raised some of the issues with NW.
3145	We are working on some of it.
3145	A meeting is a good idea.
3145	Kay
3146	Please do.
3146	I"m on a long conference call. Thanks, Kay
3147	29 Inverness Park Way, 77055
3148	This triggers Delta's obligation to fund the escrow, which now must occur on or before April 20.
3148	If they get their financing in order, it will fund sooner.
3148	Therefore, Carlos is working on the drafts of TurboPark documents.
3148	Kay
3149	I would go with Sheila's approach.
3149	I don't see a reason not to.
3149	Kay
3150	PROMISSORY NOTE For value received, [TURBINE LLC], a Delaware limited liability company (A Borrower@), hereby unconditionally promises to pay, or cause to be paid, to the order of NORTHWESTERN GENERATION I, LLC (ALender@), a wholly-owned and indirect subsidiary of NorthWestern Corporation, the principal amount of ______________DOLLARS ($____________) (the APrincipal Amount@), in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds.
3150	Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the Letter Agreement, dated April [_], 2001, between Enron North America Corp. and Lender (the ALetter Agreement@).
3150	This promissory note (this ANote@) evidences the NorSub Purchase Price Loan made by Lender to Borrower on the date hereof pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Letter Agreement; and the proceeds of such Loan shall be applied by Borrower on the date hereof as required by Section 2(e) of the Letter Agreement.
3150	The Principal Amount shall be due and payable, in full, on written demand of Lender.
3150	No interest shall accrue on the Principal Amount.
3150	Borrower waives presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest, notice of nonpayment or dishonor and all other demands and notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or enforcement of this Note.
3150	This Note may not be changed or terminated orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement or any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought.
3150	This Note shall bind Borrower and its successors and assigns, and the benefits hereof shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns.
3150	THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (DETERMINED WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW).
3150	[The balance of this page is intentionally left blank.] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower has caused this Note to be duly executed and delivered by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of the date hereof.

3151	I think this will change a bit, but it gives you some history.
3152	We had our daily phone call with NW.
3152	I don't know that we really have significant points of disagreement.
3152	They understand that we are working some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.
3152	I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I will think about it this weekend.
3152	I have a couple of ideas but I really want to mull it over.
3152	They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.
3152	Chris, could you forward the draft change orders with it?
3152	One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), retaining the payment obligation.
3152	All of this is post closing.
3152	They are putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be acceptable to GE.
3152	Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.
3152	There are no calls scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone "quiet time" to review the contract.
3152	Other than the accting issues, this should be about it.
3152	We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.
3152	Kay
3153	Here's the electronic file.
3154	I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm in Jeff Hodge/Barbara Gray's cost center.
3154	Just so long as I get paid!
3154	4-13 was a vacation day.
3154	Thanks again, Kay
3155	Sounds good to me.
3156	I think we'll still have the breakout contracts, which are essentially finished.
3156	Kay
3157	fyi, Steve should work with Ms. Clark to determine amount of payoff is required for TurboPark.
3157	Obviously, this is impacted by the date of payoff.
3157	We have discussed with GE et all the prospect of a changed order to the existing master contract for the new ones.
3157	So far, no one can find a problem with that approach.
3157	Kay
3158	FYI.
3158	I haven't read it yet.
3158	Kay
3159	I don't know if this helps, but here is the MDEA charter info.
3159	Kay
3160	Hi Bruce, There's a Christie Patrick who is a VP of Government Affairs.
3160	I'm wondering if this isn't the same person you referenced.
3160	I don't know her.
3160	Regards, Kay
3161	Enron as the buyer or seller?
3161	I have an Enron as the seller (kind of a weird deal, but at least it has most of the issues), but I can check around to see what else is on the network.
3161	Kay
3162	We have our staff meetings the 1st and 3rd Wednesday at 130.
3162	I missed the last one, so I should make it to this one.
3162	Kay
3163	Thanks.
3163	I've been trying to puzzle my way through this.
3163	Kay
3164	I don't think she's in. You might want to leave her a voice mail.
3165	I would like to sign up for the new garage, please.
3165	Thanks, Kay
3166	1.
3166	One director 2.
3166	Probably Global Finance, depending on the structure of the deal.
3166	4.
3166	I guess I see the question as the overall role of outside counsel in the transaction.
3166	Good discussion item.
3166	Kay
3167	You deserve to be pampered.
3167	I hope it works out so you can go.
3167	I think it would be a hoot.
3167	Kay
3168	Got it.
3169	Hi there, I suggest a brief status call tomorrow at 100 central to assess where we are and what we need to finish.
3169	How does this time work for everyone?
3169	Thanks, Kay
3170	That would be great.
3170	Thanks.
3170	Kay
3171	100 pm
3172	I wouldn't worry about the call.
3172	We are just collecting to do lists.
3172	I'm thinking a half hour.
3172	Kay
3173	Carolyn will send out dial in instructions.
3174	Hi there, I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.
3174	I'm fairly confident that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't called me back today to confirm.
3174	Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.
3174	Could one of you return her call for me?
3174	I'm tied up.
3174	You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a call.
3174	I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than a few minutes.
3174	I'll check with Ben.
3174	Thank you, Kay
3175	Thanks.
3175	I'll prepare Ben.
3175	Kay
3176	So far so good.
3177	Taffy, please let Ann Elizabeth know that we will reschedule the meeting.
3177	Kay
3178	We expect Delta to fund escrow this Friday.
3178	I will be suggesting to Delta that we close on April 27.
3178	Any insurmountable problems?
3178	Kay
3179	Hi there.
3179	We need to discuss the Federal Power Act and checking the box.
3179	Kay
3180	How does this look to you?
3181	I heard a rumor that there is a new leader for EEOS.
3181	True?
3181	Kay
3182	Ben wants to know if you, Marissa and Carolyn are available for lunch tomorrow at 1130.
3182	How does it sound to you?
3182	Kay
3183	Yikes!
3183	I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.
3183	I know Michael would love to go.
3183	Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt to take off and bring him.
3183	Thanks for the invitation.
3183	Kay Mann
3184	FYI.
3185	Ben is ok with the extension.
3185	Ben and I have a meeting with the accountants at 200 (just got scheduled - got to take the apptment when we can).
3185	I'm happy for you guys to go forward with the call.
3185	Ben and I will join later if we finish in time.
3185	Kay
3186	I say go ahead with the call to work through any nits etc. We will need a follow up call anyway, once we know what to do to meet the accting objectives.
3186	This means you won't be available at 200 to talk with the accts, but that's ok.
3186	Finalizing the extension sounds good to me.
3186	Kay
3187	This is the rock gym party.
3187	I bought presents for this and the Houstonian party, which is next Wednesday.
3187	Kay
3188	I suspect that Chris Calger will be signing the certificate instead of Janet Dietrich.
3188	Please use my cell phone (713 304 8716).
3189	Old Katy Road.
3190	Hi Taffy, Did the Pompano Beach meeting get scheduled?
3190	Kay
3191	Hi Matt and Ed, I need the corp docs for Salmon Energy.
3191	Do one of you gentlemen have this?
3191	We are getting close to closing.
3191	Thanks, Kay
3192	Hi Carolyn, What does Enron need to do to get the escrow account set up?
3192	Is there something Steve needs to do?
3192	Thanks, Kay
3193	I don't know.
3193	I hate to spring it on her.
3193	Maybe suggest it for next week at the Houstonian.
3194	Carlos Sole will be working on it, so I'll let him answer the timing issue.
3194	Kay
3195	Accounting and Finance tell me that wiring GE directly from escrow is ok.
3195	Kay
3196	Here's the suck up list.
3197	I had a vegetarian sandwich.
3198	I can't remember.
3199	Please confirm that the signing of the amended LLC agreements will effectively remove the current Enron officers and directors.
3199	Thanks, Kay
3200	Please tell me that this isn't the morale booster.
3200	Kay
3201	Hi Chris, We need to coordinate the setting up of an escrow account with Treasury.
3201	We will use Citibank.
3201	I believe either Rebecca and/or Kathleen worked on this on the Intergen deal.
3201	Can you help?
3201	Also, do you have an address for the location of turbine 1?
3201	Thanks, Kay
3202	Good.
3202	I don't know that a going away party for someone leaving for Mo Money is a morale booster.
3202	Got another head hunter call.
3202	Market must be picking up.
3203	Good timing.
3203	You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added to the "employee/consultant" form.
3203	Could you email me the topics so that I can take a look and make changes.
3203	Once again I expect to be on an endless conference call, but I can work while I talk.
3203	Thanks, Kay
3204	Hi Matt, Carlos gave me a file folder with the Salmon filing docs.
3204	I need the corp books with share certs, as we are selling the member interests and expect to do so with share certificates.
3204	I need it by Friday if at all possible.
3204	Thanks, Kay
3205	Hi Carolyn, Could I get a updated closing list?
3205	Thanks, Kay
3206	FYI.
3206	I'm reviewing.
3207	For those who don't think we are balance sheet sensitive...
3208	I'll look at Michael's CA and Sr. Sole' will take care of the native Americans.
3209	Hi Warren, Could you please print these for me?
3209	Thanks, Kay
3210	Hi Carolyn, Have we seen the security agreement yet?
3210	Thanks, Kay
3211	Opps.
3211	I hear I should have sent this to you.
3211	This is one of Jake's deals.
3211	Kay
3212	Is this ok?
3213	Or the lien.
3214	Hi there, Have you had a chance to look at this yet?
3214	Thanks, Kay
3215	I just called Ben.
3215	He had mentioned the Four Seasons yesterday.
3215	I'm waiting for him to call me back.
3215	Kay
3216	I missed you and your wiseass comments.
3216	Glad you're back.
3217	Carolyn, We are good to go on the ENA consent.
3217	Kay
3218	I may go home and work after I take Michael.
3218	I'll call.
3219	I guess I'd better cancel.
3219	Thanks for the reminder.
3219	Kay
3220	Hi Ed, Here's a certificate of incumbancy we need to Jake's Delta deal.
3220	Can you handle signature?
3220	We can work with a fax today, but will need a fully executed original for the bank.
3220	Jake, we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up.
3220	We have assumed that you will be executing the docs.
3220	If there's any problem with the list, please let me know.
3220	We need this document to set up the escrow account today.
3220	Thanks, Kay
3221	Hi Kathleen, Here's another deal like CA Development.
3221	We'll be doing the certificate of incumb.
3221	today, I think.
3221	Kay
3222	David Duran can sign the certificate.
3222	Can he certify his own name?
3222	If so, we want him to also be a signatory.
3222	Authorized signers should be Dave Duran (managing director), Michael J Miller (vice president) and Kevin Presto (vice president).
3222	Kathleen, please verify the way these guys like to sign their names, and current titles.
3222	Let me know if you think we should use someone else.
3222	Chris, we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for the wires.
3222	They will be a call back person.
3222	Other call backs are me (using Thanks, Kay
3223	Please give Marissa this info.
3223	Thanks, Kay
3224	Isabel, I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.
3224	The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent, and remain unchanged.
3224	Please let me know if you don't have the earlier versions.
3224	Kay
3225	Hi Reagan, Have you revised the exhibits to clarify the scope of scheduling services?
3225	Thanks, Kay
3226	Hi Rose, I hate to be a pain, but we are trying to sign up Northwestern this week, and the last thing we have to do is the assignment and assumption agreement.
3226	Any break in the log jam with McKay?
3226	Kay
3227	Please print and put in folder "Northwestern documents 4/19".
3227	Thanks, Kay
3228	Nearly final docs.
3228	The change they want in the LLC is the addition of a statement indicating that for tax purposes this is a single member LLC, or something like that.
3228	The promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism for any change orders.
3228	Has something to do with them getting all the basis.
3228	Kay
3229	Congratulations on your new adventure.
3229	I'll miss having you as a neighbor and a colleague.
3229	Kay
3230	Can you sneak me a copy of the latest draft?
3230	Maybe I can negotiate with Ben.
3230	Kay
3231	No comment.
3232	You asked for the exhibits.
3232	Kay
3233	Ever get the POR info?
3234	Hi guys, Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.
3234	Actually, some are questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me: Receipt Point - need def'n RR Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an exhibit to describe.
3234	RR Off peak defn - RR transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.
3234	Any suggestions?
3234	scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
3234	term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is it back in?
3234	If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
3234	contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule.
3234	Name, date, subject matter of contract.
3234	More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.
3234	Reagan, you might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.
3234	Thanks!
3234	Kay
3235	Check.
3235	Kay
3236	what are you talking about?
3236	Are you going to be a GRANNY???
3237	Where do you want this to go?
3237	Someone (I think Dave) asked that this be added: Each day EPMI shall provide EPMI's Native Load projection, and gas and power projection.
3237	Would it be a projection of MDEA's Native Load?
3237	Are we providing it or is MDEA?
3237	By what time is the made and is it made 365 days a year?
3238	So now I know why Sheila had a lock installed on her door.
3239	Hi Lee, Just wanted to check to see if you will be around tomorrow.
3239	I'm trying to get things lined up on multiple fronts, and all roads lead to you.
3239	Thanks, Kay
3240	You made a comment on page 13.
3240	It says "(c) purchase of power ...."
3240	I think this is one of your comments.
3240	What does it mean?
3240	I'm on a conference call, so an email response would be appreciated.
3241	yes.
3242	Hi Warren, I'm going to forward a couple of emails relating to the Delta transaction.
3242	Please print and set up like you did the Northwestern stuff.
3242	Thanks, Kay PS I'm on a long conference call, but feel free to walk in.
3243	here's a second email.
3243	Another to come.
3244	re: my prior email.
3244	When you print these, please attach the email to the attachment (hard copy).
3244	thanks
3245	Gentlemen, Here are some points which require commercial et al input: Do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit?
3245	We will be buying electricity to serve their load.
3245	How should be be paid for those costs?
3245	How often?
3245	Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil.
3245	What do you want to do?
3245	I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs.
3245	How should it be used in the agreement?
3245	Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment to the equipment listed in the exhibit?
3245	What financial security will be required of them?
3245	Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing a time line?
3245	How do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area?
3245	Are we absorbing it?
3245	Will there be additional infrastructure costs?
3245	Have the exhibits been updated?
3245	If so, could I get the latest version?
3245	Kay
3246	Hi Steve, We need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from escrow.
3246	It should be an account where money goes in and out in one day.
3246	Can you track down the info?
3246	We are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will close once we deliver our deliverables.
3246	Stay tuned!
3246	Kay
3247	Here's what Delta would like in the Salmon break out contract.
3247	How does it look to you?
3247	Kay
3248	Is there anything we need to get them to consent to?
3248	Kay
3249	She called me, too.
3250	I'm not betting the farm on the escrow funding tomorrow.
3250	I'll manage expectations on this end.
3250	I don't want to let up on Delta, however.
3251	I think she will have a great time.
3251	The moms and dads are very friendly.
3251	She'll probably know some of them!
3252	Good idea.
3252	I wouldn't mind something that says that funding of the escrow is tantamount to closing of the financing under the letter agreement, so thatthe financing condition is satisfied.
3252	Something to that effect.
3252	It willcalm Jake down considerably.
3252	Kay
3253	Here's the latest, not-yet-final-but-getting-better agreement.
3253	I may not have sent this to everyone who needs it, but I know Reagan will take care of it.
3253	Speaking of Reagan, he is generating exhibits.
3253	Kay
3254	Lisa Mellencamp used to have a list of local counsel.
3254	Kay
3255	Gee, one more item for your review.
3255	Kay
3256	Any recruits?
3256	Kay
3257	Thanks, Cindy.
3257	I haven't given up hope yet!
3257	Kay
3258	I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.
3258	I believe the last draft was around the beginning of April.
3258	I can check for more specifics.
3258	Kay
3259	Carolyn, I prefer that closing event #4 preceed #3.
3259	Thanks, Kay
3260	Oh why not.
3260	You probably need to get an overview of the entire deal, as you may want some outside help.
3260	If we are building a plant and selling power, there are lots of folks at Enron who weigh in on it.
3260	Kay
3261	Any comments?
3261	Thanks, Kay
3262	looks good to me.
3263	Could you email me the final form of the assignment/assumption (not compared).
3263	Thanks, Kay
3264	Hi there, Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent included.
3264	Please let me know if you have any comments.
3264	Thanks, Kay PS.
3264	In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.
3264	I can't find a flaw with that approach.
3265	Guess we might want to lob this one in to Delta, just for fun.
3265	Kay
3266	Please print and review to let me know if there is anything stupid in these.
3266	Kay
3267	Can you help me with these?
3267	I need to get them fixed up today.
3267	Thanks, Kay
3268	Hi Rose, NorthWestern has requested these minor changes.
3268	What do you think?
3268	Kay
3269	Thanks for the offer (and the call) but I haven't been able to secure a sitter for Michael.
3269	My schedule should be getting better (famous last words), and I hope we can get together soon.
3269	I would like to introduce you to Carlos Sole, if you haven't met him yet.
3269	Thanks again, Kay
3270	Yet one more round.
3271	It wouldn't be the same without you!
3272	3 nights out in a row would be a bit much for this ol girl.
3273	Any other rumors?
3274	I have my CA expert (Kathleen Carnahan) is working on it now.
3274	Kay
3275	I'm available any time Monday morning.
3275	The sooner (after 830), the better.
3275	Thanks, Kay
3276	opps.
3276	I just opened this.
3277	Attached is the current form of the assignment agreement.
3277	I'm awaiting final approval from Finance, but I think we should get this in front of GE.
3277	Ben, do you or Chris want to handle this, or shall I?
3277	Kay
3278	Hi Jim, We haven't worked with a term sheet on the equipment sales I've worked on.
3278	Good luck, Kay
3279	Please add this to the defn of confidential information: Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, business strategies, transaction structures, pricing formulae, and other business methods.
3279	We will call it the "Michael Brown burn me twice shame on me" clause.
3279	Thanks, Kay
3280	I decided to go a different route.
3280	What do you think?
3280	Kay
3281	I told Jeff Hodge that you were putting him on the list for baseball tickets.
3281	Guess the pressure is on now.
3282	Attached is the King & Spalding power transaction deal team.
3282	I'll update the information I have for A &K and B &P, since some of the designated lawyers on their lists are no longer there.
3282	Kay
3283	Well, aren't you the quick one.
3283	Jeff is a terrific guy, well-respected in the legal department and on the commercial side.
3283	Kay
3284	Hi Clark, Could you fill out this chart for us with names and contact info for the Bracewell person (or people) you think would fit the bill the best?
3284	We had a list previously, but I believe some of the folks on it have moved on.
3284	Thanks, Kay
3285	jhodge@enron.com I checked his business cards on his desk.
3285	He's left for the day to pick up a car at the shop, so don't be offended if you don't hear from him immediately.
3285	Kay
3286	I wanted to review where I think we are in this transaction.
3286	1.
3286	Escrow account.
3286	We are still awaiting closure on the issue of the lender's security interest in the escrow account.
3286	A proposal was discussed with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta had defaulted under their loan arrangement.
3286	Indications were that this approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter agreement concerning this approach.
3286	This has not yet been received.
3286	This prevents the establishment of the escrow account.
3286	We have sent the escrow agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the agreement.
3286	2.
3286	GE turbine contract.
3286	Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these were forwarded to GE.
3286	I have not received a response from GE.
3286	3.
3286	Miscellaneous docs.
3286	Enron has responded to all the documents requested by Hancock.
3286	We are awaiting responses to our drafts.
3286	4.
3286	GE consent.
3286	Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a new letter agreement.
3286	GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.
3286	GE has dealt directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we aren't involved in. I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.
3286	Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.
3286	Kay
3287	1st group evalutes promotions to VP.
3287	Ben is on the analyst PRC.
3288	I'm thinking we are short lawyers.
3288	Hope that means good things for the survivors!
3289	monday test
3290	Can you see the mountains today?
3290	Later, Kay
3291	Do you have enovate agreement handy?
3292	okey dokey.
3292	Aren't you on holiday?
3293	I was kinda hoping you would fill in the blanks.
3294	Looks like they have re-surfaced.
3294	Kay
3295	nuttin from nobody Congrats on the ride.
3295	Are you standing up at your desk today?
3296	I didn't know if the seat or the feet give out first.
3297	Nope.
3297	Carlos Sole (one of our lawyers) took the forms I gave him and fit it to this deal.
3297	I do think the banks' lawyers weighed in. Kay
3298	Hi Warren, Hope you had a nice weekend.
3298	My weekend went too quickly.
3298	Could you please print this email and the attachments for me?
3298	Thanks, Kay
3299	Michael Brown, Do you have the standard offer service agreement?
3299	It isn't in Stuart's file, and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the PPSA.
3299	We need to see how these two agreements fit together.
3299	Has NIMO given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules?
3299	We especially need to see the ones that they can assign to Enron (PSEG and NRG).
3299	Given the size of the transaction I think we should have Klauberg (or another New York lawyer) take a look at it.
3299	It is an interesting deal.
3299	Kay
3300	Didn't I mark his up all ready?
3301	Hi Jerry, It would be helpful if the tax point person for NorthWestern could contact Rhett Jackson with Enron.
3301	Rhett's number is 713 853-4718.
3301	Thanks, Kay
3302	Maybe next time.
3302	I understand that you are just back from holiday, so obviously this comes at a bad time.
3302	See you in SA.
3302	Kay
3303	I hope this is the last thing.
3303	Here's the latest version of the contract sans these insertions.
3304	Hi guys, Is the LV Co Gen break out contract ready to go?
3304	Lee Johnson was asking this am.
3304	Thanks, Kay
3305	In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.
3305	I seem to recall that Sheila had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA Development stuff.
3305	I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.
3305	There's probably someone with a better memory.
3305	Thoughts?
3305	Thanks, Kay
3306	Please confirm that the changes to change order #2 reflect NW's request.
3306	Thanks, Kay
3307	Needless to say I had a pretty good idea of the location of the bottleneck.
3307	Otherwise, I would have called you.
3307	Peggy Banczak quit.
3307	She told me herself, so it must be true.
3308	You got it.
3308	I asked Carlos if he still speaks espanol.
3308	You should have seen his face.
3308	He looked like he had swallowed a bug.
3309	Lee, I'm reading your email to say that their requested changes are fine by you.
3309	Please let me know if I'm wrong.
3309	Thanks, Kay
3310	Insert at p.
3310	42 as ARTICLE XII.
3310	ARTICLE XII.
3310	ADJUSTMENTS REGARDING UNITS WITH SERIAL NUMBERS LISTED IN EXHIBIT P 12.1 Adjustments in Performance Guarantees to Reflect Site Conditions.
3310	Seller recognizes that the Sites for the Units identified and listed by serial number in Exhibit P have not been identified by Purchaser.
3310	When the Site for each such Unit has been identified and the corresponding Site conditions for each such Unit has been provided by Purchaser to Seller, Seller and Purchaser agree to amend the Guaranteed Levels and the Specific Performance Levels for each such Unit to reflect changes in the Basis Conditions made to reflect the Site conditions for each such Unit.
3310	The Guaranteed Levels and Specific Performance Levels as so amended will be consistent with those customarily provided by Seller for other LM 6000 Enhanced Sprint combustion turbine generator units in the United States with comparable Site conditions.
3310	12.2 Storage of Unit(s).
3310	Seller and Purchaser recognize and agree that the period or periods during which any of the Units identified and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage (a) by Seller pursuant to Section 10.2.7 or (b) by Purchaser, as agreed between Seller and Purchaser, shall not be considered, directly or indirectly, in determining the commencement of the Primary Warranty Period or the Extended Warranty Period, or both.
3310	12.3 Maximum Period of Seller Liability.
3310	To the extent any Unit identified and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage as contemplated in Section 12.2, the duration of such storage period shall be added, in the case of each such Unit, to the six (6)-year period identified in the last sentence of Section 27.1 for purposes of calculating the maximum duration of Seller's liability with respect to any such Unit and with respect to this Agreement.
3310	12.4 No Effect on Cost, Schedule or Scope of Work.
3310	Seller and Purchaser agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates, or all of them.
3311	Very impressive.
3311	We don't have to read these, do we?
3312	Hi Warren, Please print these and set me up a binder called NIMO May 2001 Bid.
3312	Please index the documents.
3312	It would make sense for the documents to be in the same order as they are on the email.
3312	Thank you.
3312	Kay
3313	We have requested changes at NorthWestern's request.
3313	Please advise if there are any problems.
3313	Kay
3314	You are working too hard.
3315	Hope you have a good book to read.
3316	I am not quite a wreck, and no promotion or raise.
3316	I'll be at the Lake Austin Spa weekend after next, so that keeps me going.
3317	20 pounds!!!!!!!!
3317	Sounds like you to need to buy yourself some new clothes.
3318	Pete, Finance has requested these changes: Notices to ENA as agent for E-Next.
3318	Signature block should be for E-Next Generation, acting through its agent, Enron North America.
3318	E Next will not be signing, as ENA will sign on its behalf.
3318	Or, ENA, as agent for...
3318	Thanks, Kay
3319	Hi there.
3319	This is the letter Hancock is willing to give us in exchange for Hancock getting a security interest in the escrow account.
3319	Any comments?
3319	Kay
3320	We hope to have it executed today or tomorrow.
3320	Kay
3321	Hi Carolyn, Any progress with the escrow agreement and any other outstanding items?
3321	Kathleen Carnahan has the original certificate of incumbancy ready to go.
3321	I would like to get organized for signing docs today, GE, Enron and Delta.
3321	Could you email me the execution forms of the docs which need to be signed by GE and Enron (except the turbine contract)?
3321	Hard copies are fine, I just figure electronic will be easier.
3321	I had conversations with GE re turbine contract, and I expect it will be finished up this am.
3321	Thanks, Kay
3322	Hi Wilson, I've decided that it would be helpful to have a brief written explanation of what limits of liability and waivers of consequential damages are permissable under Mississippi law when contracting with the Cities or an energy authority.
3322	Could you provide me with something along that line?
3322	Thank you, Kay
3323	Hi Ed, This transaction should close within the next 5-7 days.
3323	Will the original minute books be ready?
3323	Thanks, Kay
3324	I sent this yesterday before 5 to find out what you were planning to do re Michael, the game, etc.
3325	This week, if possible.
3325	As always, the sooner, the better.
3326	I forgot about Grandma.
3326	I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR).
3326	Hamburgers sound good to me.
3326	I think MAM does ok in the morning, he just needs his hours of sleep.
3326	Paige was worse to get up.
3327	you bet
3328	Nope.
3328	Christi Nicolay (a lawyer in the Reg Affairs) is the authority on interconnection as far as I'm concerned.
3328	Kay
3329	I double checked and ENext/Wilmington Trust will not be executing the contract.
3330	Questions re Northwestern from one of the Enron execs.
3330	Kay
3331	GE has agreed to the requested changes to the parent guaranty.
3331	Kay
3332	Moving forward, inch by inch.
3333	Hi Kent, These are some requested changes to the Salmon a/k/a Delta break out agreement.
3333	I'm not comfortable that Lee has reviewed these, as the comments were previously forwarded in another email.
3333	In any event, we are looking for GE's blessings on this addition.
3333	It seems to me that we are approaching time to gather GE's signatures on the various docs.
3333	I will forward separately the email I received from our outside counsel with the final forms of everything but the break out contract, the assignment and assumption agreement and the GE parent guaranty.
3333	Thanks for your assistance.
3333	The
3334	Ok, I give up.
3334	What's an estoppel letter?
3335	Sounds good to me, although we are likely to find different purchasers want other stuff as well.
3335	Kinda like on the turbine stuff - each counterparty has wanted something different.
3336	Lined against 3 sounds good.
3336	Circulate to me, Bill, Dale, Lee, Kent Shoemaker.
3336	Kay
3337	Missing you....
3338	Hi Jerry, Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?
3338	I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to the LLC agreement.
3338	We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.
3338	Thanks, Kay
3339	Me again.
3339	Please see the second paragraph regarding the authority of the Cities and MDEA to enter into contracts.
3339	Your opinion would be most appreciated.
3339	Thanks, Kay
3340	Hi Theresa, I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.
3340	He suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the escrow fee of $10,500.
3340	Please let me know what other info you need to tee this up.
3340	Thanks, Kay
3341	Ed is the only one I've heard from today.
3341	I've forwarded his questions to our local counsel in Mississippi for their input insofar as the questions involve capacity to contract.
3341	You'll be pleased to know that I understood his questions.
3341	I'm so proud.
3341	Kay
3342	Jerry, Would you mind re-sending?
3342	I can't find it on my system anywhere.
3342	I did find the signature page sent 4/20.
3342	Many thanks, Kay
3343	Here is a revised change order which we hope will adequately address issues raised by GE and by NorthWestern.
3343	Kay
3344	Hi Warren, Please print all of these documents, and place in individual file folders with the name of the document.
3344	I will need 6 copies of each of the signature pages for each of the documents.
3344	If it is easier you can just make 6 copies of each document.
3344	Thanks, Kay
3345	Ben, In speaking with Herman, he suggested that you look at the earnings on Blue Dog on the hot list.
3345	It is showing a total $10.5 (4 East, 4 West in q2, 2.5 in q3 (East).
3346	Has GE signed off on the numbers?
3346	Kay
3347	Is this the right account for Pegasus to send the money to?
3347	Thanks, Kay
3348	It looks good to me.
3348	Am I missing something?
3349	Hi Warren, FYI.
3350	I count small wins!
3351	Latest draft of turbine contract for LV Co Gen.
3352	Attached is a redline version of the turbine contract, showing changes from the previous form.
3352	Kay
3353	Isabel, Please confirm before 830 central this morning (when GE's rep will be in my office to sign docs) that these documents have final approval of GE's counsel, as I believe Kent is not available to review documents today.
3353	Obviously, I cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative of GE without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents, except to the extent that the changes are obviously minor.
3353	Kay
3354	Have a good trip.
3355	Warren, The other party changed all those docs I asked you to print (not the ones in the book, the ones for the folders), so you can skip that one.
3355	Thanks, Kay
3356	I guess we know now that they weren't waiting on us, since they hadn't finished the GE docs.
3356	Kay
3357	Isabel, Unless I'm missing something, two of these documents are the same (93), and we are missing the no objections to forms letter.
3357	Kay
3358	Did Kent review the changes to (h) of the consent agreement (re jurisdiction)?
3358	Kay
3359	Isabel, Who is the "intial purchaser", and why are the documents dated tomorrow?
3359	Thanks again, Kay
3360	Looks to me like they aren't ready to close their financing.
3360	Hope I'm wrong.
3361	Hey, I thought you were out.
3361	I hope you noted that I was watching out for you.
3362	It would appear to me that the closing of the Salmon equity sale will not occur until May something or other, so that the documents which are deliverables at closing should have May something or other dates, and not April.
3362	Anyone see it any differently?
3362	Kay
3363	I haven't seen the escrow disbursement letter lately.
3363	Is it circulating?
3363	Kay
3364	As I understand it, if the escrow is funded tomorrow morning, the earliest closing date would be May 2nd.
3364	Kay
3365	It is our responsibility to pay the fees, which I hope will need to be paid today.
3365	Thanks, Kay
3366	for your review and approval.
3366	I have your signature on this one.
3367	I have the executed signature pages and the certificate of incumbancy.
3367	I'm going to print today's other ENA deliverables and fax to Jake for signature after I initial.
3367	Kay
3368	Might close on the letter agreement today.
3368	You didn't miss much - mostly negotiations with GE re: change orders.
3368	Our tax guys are happy, and Accounting is hanging in there.
3368	We have revised the payment schedule in the doc, but NW doesn't have the change.
3368	I'll send it to you.
3368	The change is minor.
3368	I need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement, then we'll be ready to go when GE signs up to the CO's.
3368	Kay
3369	Per my previous email.
3369	NW doesn't have this change.
3370	Redline of revised assignment and assumption agreement.
3370	Kay
3371	Please delete Michael Miller.
3371	It would be helpful if I don't have to get the certificate today, as that entails signatures of folks in two locations.
3371	Isabel didn't have it on her list.
3371	It is also helpful if the certificate is signed by Duran or Calger.
3371	Kathleen, is Chris Calger an MD or VP?
3371	Thanks, Kay
3372	Carolyn, I faxed signed sig pages for the ENA letter, ENA consent, resolution authorizing transaction, GE letter as to forms, escrow agreement, cert of incumbancy for escrow, fee agreement.
3372	I faxed the docs to the 80 fax number.
3372	Thanks, Kay
3373	Hi there, We plan to sign on the dotted line with NorthWestern today.
3373	MKahn (who works through lunch, don't you know) is turning the final draft of the letter agreement.
3373	Kay
3374	I authorized the wire to be sent to set up the account.
3374	Progress!
3375	Did you get word that the Delta deal is going into escrow tomorrow, closing on May 2nd?
3375	Kay
3376	Kent, This forms supposedly integrated the requested changes you saw previously.
3376	Would love to have this by Friday.
3376	I'll forward the opinion letter in just a sec.
3376	Thanks, Kay
3377	Is this ready to go as far as your concerned?
3377	Kay
3378	Hi Catherine, I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.
3378	I understand there is also a two day notice.
3378	I don't believe I've seen a form for that one yet.
3378	Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?
3378	Thanks, Kay
3379	832 651 3478 is what I have
3380	When sending out the assignment and assumption agreement, are we sending originals to all four people listed in the second paragraph?
3380	Do you remember how many originals are required?
3380	Thanks, Kay
3381	I may need your help.
3381	Kay
3382	Hi Wilson, Are you available for a conference call with David Hunt and me tomorrow?
3382	Maybe something in the am?
3382	Thanks, Kay
3383	Re: my voice mail concerning masters.
3384	We need the Assignment and Assumption and Bill of Sale signed.
3384	Kay
3385	Your esteemed colleague suggested I send this to you for your review.
3385	Kay
3386	I'm scheduled to be in a meeting tomorrow am, but I know this deal is in good hands.
3386	Page me if anything exciting happens.
3386	I'm fine with the assignment agreement version PH sent out this afternoon.
3386	I'm sure MK has the punctuation just right.
3386	Kay
3387	CC, I would really like to have a signed off closing list and final forms of all docs by mid-day Friday.
3387	If something happens and I either can't be on the call or forget to bring this up, please mention it.
3387	Thanks,
3388	Gentlemen, These docs are ready to go, and your signatures would be appreciated.
3388	I will initial the docs when Steve delivers them to me tomorrow.
3388	Kay
3389	The fun never ends.
3390	Just tell me the end is in sight.
3391	Attached is the latest revision, incorporating comments from the Enron team.
3391	There were some comments which were either discussion points or not readily decipherable, so those will need to be addressed in the next version.
3391	There's still some harmonization/nit stuff which we will pick up then also.
3391	Hopefully, David Hunt (MDEA's lawyer) and I will hammer out the more legalistic (yet important) stuff while he is in our office tomorrow.
3391	Ed, maybe we can schedule a call with our local counsel to get some more comfort on the authority issue.
3391	In addition, we can ask for an authority/enforceability opinion from MDEA's counsel.
3391	We'll beef up the reps as well.
3391	Reagan/David, Ed's availability is best first thing tomorrow (Thurs) morning.
3391	See you soon, Kay
3392	hey, good questions.
3392	I'll check.
3393	Will you be providing an execution version with questions removed/blanks filled in?
3393	Please send it directly to kent.shoemaker@ae.ge.com, copy to me.
3393	Thanks, Thanks, Kay
3394	Didn't go through the first time.
3394	Kay
3395	Can you tell me to whom we send the originals?
3395	Kay
3396	Hi Estelle, Have you or Barbara sent the email etc out re establishment of the account?
3396	We are on a conference call now re funding.
3396	Thanks for your help, Kay
3397	Hi Guys, Delta has asked when the LOC can be issued for the final payment.
3397	We have every expectation that payment will be made on May 2nd, and we will know for sure by later today.
3397	Would it be possible to have the LOC by Tuesday?
3397	Thanks, Kay
3398	Salmon Energy.
3399	Fed ref now available.
3400	John, Just wanted you to be aware.
3400	No action required - water under the bridge.
3400	Kay
3401	Bill, I don't have any information about the ABB contract.
3401	At last word, Lee Johnson was reviewing the latest version of the GE contract that Pete Thompson had sent out.
3401	Kay
3402	I'm about to fall face down in my computer.
3402	I'm not as young as I used to be.
3402	Kay
3403	FYI, Dale has the lead on this one.
3403	Thanks, Kay
3404	Don't forget that Global Finance is supposed to review these.
3404	They have the turbine contract.
3405	This is none of my business, but the turbines are owned by ENext.
3405	Hows does the LLC give the assignment?
3405	Should the turbine contract be in the name of the LLC, because it isn't at this moment.
3405	Maybe I messed up.
3405	Kay
3406	Thanks thanks thanks
3407	This change really helps me with babysitter problems.
3407	Thanks, Kay
3408	I would think that Dale would have the legal lead, since he is the project's lawyer.
3408	Lisa Bills, Roseann Engeldorf and Catherine Clark are the people I send TurboPark stuff to.
3408	Kay
3409	fyi.
3409	We are hoping to get together at 900 to continue to work on our interim gameplan.
3409	I don't know the location yet.
3409	Kay
3410	By the way, they have seen the turbine contract.
3411	This is the counterparties' first draft of the one month agreement.
3411	Kay
3412	You may have seen one of these before...
3413	fyi Carlos is working on it.
3414	I made some comments/revisions.
3414	I'm not sure I understand the profit/savings, but I didn't take the time to contemplate it.
3415	I thought I did help.
3415	I'm lost.
3416	Lee johnson just called to see when he can sign the agreement.
3416	I told him I would ask you guys.
3416	Kay
3417	Glad you made it safely!
3417	I have a new home email address kay.mann@worldnet.att.net Have a nice afternoon, and enjoy the cool mornings while they last.
3417	Love, Kay
3418	the first couple of pages sort of explains whose on first.
3419	I may make the tour through the going aways, esp Oz.
3419	I called the spa to make appts, but got voice mail.
3419	Love, Kay
3420	Starting point for exhibit 2
3421	Fine by me.
3422	I think you can send it just so he has the form, and we can figure out what we need to do with it.
3422	Kay
3423	Many thanks.
3423	Pardon my ignorance, but is there a list of riders to select from?
3423	The transaction that we are contemplating is with a municipality, so we need some muny language if such thing exists.
3423	Thanks, Kay
3424	I think there's lots which will need to be fixed.
3424	I can't fix it now, though.
3424	Here's where I am on the ILA.
3424	I think it should be distributed internally and to the Cities ASAP, with an explanation that we are still pondering it.
3424	Kay PS.
3424	I didn't redline because there were formatting challenges I couldn't figure out.
3424	Kay
3425	We are going to do a one month deal while we work on the long term deal.
3425	Talk to you soon, Kay
3426	Terrific.
3426	Have a great weekend!
3426	Kay
3427	Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.
3427	I'll check into it for the longer term deal.
3427	Obviously, it is a Mississippi law issue, so I'll have to get an opinion.
3427	Kay
3428	This shows changes as if they were revising the doc that we generated on Friday.
3429	Here are the issues I see with their draft: Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to others.
3429	This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full contract in place.
3429	Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel oil.
3429	Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.
3429	Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.
3429	Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the market.
3430	Hi Carolyn, As far as I know, we are still on board for closing on Wednesday.
3430	Kay
3431	Consistent with my discussions with Reagan, I have revised the body of the interim agreement.
3431	Some of the exhibit references will need to be cleaned up once we know where we are headed.
3431	Kay
3432	I think we are supposed to do this tomorrow (Monday).
3432	Kay
3433	I have a closing scheduled for Wednesday, so I don't know when I'll be getting to San Antonio.
3433	Better leave me off the list.
3433	Thanks, Kay
3434	Kay
3435	No.
3436	For future reference on the long term deal.
3436	Kay
3437	Need exhibit B added.
3437	Redlines are against most recent version sent by Reagan.
3438	I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.
3438	I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are coming from Portland.
3438	I'll have to check to see what can be done.
3438	Kay
3439	The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.Does it have to be an original?
3439	Kay
3440	Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.
3440	I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.
3440	There is nenough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the Portlandteam wants to sign the documents.
3440	Kay
3441	I did, and it is fine.
3441	Kay
3442	Hi Ed, Here's the language they offered: M. Each of the Cities has obligated itself to be responsible for and to payto, or on behalf of, MDEA, if required, that proportion of the minimum monthly fee which that City,s hourly demand was coincident with Entergypeak hour demand in the year 2000 bears to the sum of both Cities, hourldemand during such hour; provided however, that each City has further obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay that portion of EMPI,smonthly fee which the economic benefit to that City from transactions bearsto the total economic benefit to both Cities from such transactions duringthe month.
3442	It is a bit cumbersome, but I think I like it.
3442	What do you think?
3442	I'll forward the entire doc soon.
3442	Kay
3443	During the Term of this ILA, EPMI shall be entitled to be paid a fee for for performance as follows: i.
3443	EPMI shall be paid a fee equal to the sum of 1) the Incentive Fee whichshall not be less than $12,500 and 2) a fee of $1/MWhr above the deliveredprice for purchases of Off-Peak Power (the fee of $1/MWh shall not be included in the calculation of Savings), and 3) payment for the deliveredcost of market power purchased to serve MDEA,s and the Cities Native Load in accordance with the transaction Confirmation.
3443	Individual transactions willbe confirmed by written confirmation to be acknowledged and signed by EPMIand jointly by MDEA, YCPSC and CPUC..
3443	ii.
3443	In the event that this ILA is terminated early, the minimum monthly Incentive Fee amount shall be $12,500 divided by thirty (30) and multipliedtimes the number of days in May in which this Agreement was in effect.
3443	iii.
3443	The Incentive Fee shall consist of forty percent (40%) of the Total Daily Savings.
3443	Total Daily Savings is the product of (1) the Savings per Mcalculated for the day, times (2) the total MWh for the same day of marketpower purchased to serve system load.
3443	iv.
3443	Savings per MWh is calculated as the positive difference between (a) thMDEA Target Production Cost for units that would have run if market powerwere not purchased to serve system load, and (b) the delivered cost of market power purchased to serve system load.
3444	This is really just an excuse to write - did you give me the executed pages?
3444	Thanks,
3445	Hi guys, Lee Johnson is asking about the break out contract for LV Co Genn and when it will be ready.
3445	I need to return his phone call, especially since I need one more deliverable to be able to close the Delta transaction.
3445	What should I tell him?
3445	Kay
3446	I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow, buJake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready until Wednesday am.
3446	It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would appreciate it if you could confirm.
3446	Thanks, Kay
3447	I suspect they are accustomed to people wanting to structure for an MTM deal from a commercial standpoint.
3447	Doesn't sound like our objective here.
3448	Hi John, It would probably be better for me if we could reschedule, since I will be out of town Wed-Mon.
3448	Rain check?
3448	Kay
3449	Perfectly.
3449	thanks
3450	I'll check.
3450	I remember signing the faxes and signing the originals, but not the return.
3450	However, last week was the WEEK FROM HELL, so I easily could have missed it.
3450	Kay
3451	Here's what I have on my list as original deliverables GE turbine contract - any officer of LLC Amended LLC- any officer of ENA Membership certificates - signed by MD of LLC, which isn't Jake The only things I have which MUST be signed by Jake are the written consentof the LLC, which aren't on the original deliverable list.
3451	These will beready first thing Wednesday am.
3451	I'm sorry, I don't recall you telling me that the original membership certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday.
3451	However, we will be able thandle this.
3451	This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off closinglist by mid-day Friday.
3451	Thanks, Kay
3452	Carolyn, Please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect Chris Calger as a signatory.
3452	Thanks, Kay
3453	You sound like Carlos.
3454	Good morning.
3454	In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the following today: GE parent guaranty LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow) Opinion of counsel And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.
3454	Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen contract is ready.
3454	Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.
3454	Thanks, Kay
3455	It depends on what time I get the signatures.
3455	If I can get things signed uquickly, I'll have them delivered to you in plenty of time for you to sendthe docs.
3455	I would prefer that it work that way.
3455	Chris Calger is in our offices today - a terrific break.
3455	Now if I can jusfind him.
3455	Plus, I thought I would have him sign the escrow disbursement letter instead of Jake, since he's here.
3455	Kay
3456	Duran is fine.
3456	I had it in my mind that Calger had signed the incumbancy cert.
3456	My mistake.
3456	I'm trying to set up a closing table and have these guys sign this am beforI lose them.
3456	Kay
3457	Don't have it, but we can ask local counsel.
3457	If you can email me the question you would like asked, I will pass it along to our Miss lawyer.
3457	Kay
3458	That would be better, although I will tell them that they don't get it until closing.
3458	Kay
3459	I've asked for it separately (second item below).
3459	Did I misunderstand your question?
3459	I'm setting up a table with all the stuff for signature now.
3459	Kay
3460	Kathleen is coming up to help me set up.
3460	How about 11?
3460	If you see Kathleen, can you give her the membership certificates?
3460	I'll have a stack for Duran later.
3460	Kay
3461	Here's the long awaited form of option for your review and comment.
3461	I'm sending it to Rose, Lisa and Catherine for their review also.
3461	Thanks, Kay
3462	I'm supposed to go to the law conference tomorrow evening.
3463	May 2 it is.
3464	go go go, as we say at Enron
3465	Please review numbers.
3465	Any chance D. Duran can come with you guys?
3465	We should be ready in about 15 minutes.
3465	Thanks, Kay
3466	Isabel and Greg, I'm having a logistical problem.
3466	The only managing director of Salmon is not in the office today.
3466	I can have the membership certificates signed by (1) a vice president or (1) the managing member or (3) elect a new managing director.
3466	What's your preference?
3466	Kay
3467	Could you email me the last version of the turbine contract?
3467	thanks, Kay
3468	I know that GE recently had a small comment, technical or scope related, but I don't recall if it was before or after the 24th.
3468	I was unaware of Tom's involvement, so I want to make sure the comment was addressed.
3468	I'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle signature.
3468	I suspect I'm creating confusion as well.
3468	Kay
3469	If it will help, I will see if I can find the last version transmitted to Lisa et al, so they don't have to start from scratch.
3469	Kay
3470	One comment which was taken related to the applicable change in law date.
3471	I sent this email from GE to Dale/Bill after I received it.
3471	Since Peter's last draft was April 24, I'm I assume this wasn't included: Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.
3471	One change required to the Rev 5 document.
3471	In Exhibit B, Add item "27)One additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)" Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.
3471	Thanks, Lee
3472	This is the same version you sent today, right?
3473	Done.
3474	I may be wrong, but I believe the version sent to day is the same one I sent to Rose, Lisa et al on April 24.
3474	Kay
3475	I think now we should all just log off email and turn off our phones, and let Fed Ex, the fax machine and Citibank do the rest.
3476	Kent, Are you sending this (and the opinion and LOC) to me today?
3476	I wasn't sure where this landed.
3476	Thanks, Kay
3477	Could you get me that cert of sec ASAP?
3477	I need to get this stuff to Carolyn soon.
3477	Kay
3478	In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.
3478	The opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can sign for Dan Rowley if that is acceptable.
3478	DRowley can sign originals on Thursday.
3478	The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in escrow until the LOC is delivered.
3478	There will be three original opinions.
3478	There is one original guaranty, and I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.
3478	Obviously, there will be only one LOC.
3478	Kay
3479	I know Michael wants to go to your apt this afternoon.
3479	If you do go there, just give me a call to let me know you're there so we can coordinate pickup.
3479	See you soon, Kay
3480	what do you think?
3481	general counsel
3482	1400 Smith, Room 3882A
3483	You are my hero.
3483	Kay
3484	John, I humbly beg your forgiveness for not calling you.
3484	Now I owe you.
3484	I will check my directory to see what I have.
3484	As I recall it was part of some special scratch my back I'll scratch yours deal, although the details now escape me.
3484	Seems like there were some minor defects which could be repaired while GE stored the stuff, so we let them put the stuff in storage based on their rep things would get fixed.
3484	Kay
3485	Good morning.
3485	I haven't seen the insurance certificate she references.
3485	Anyone know where it is?
3485	Is the retention letter of credit available yet?
3485	I know it has been requested, but I don't recall seeing that it has been delivered.
3485	Thanks for everything, Kay
3486	Ignore my last email.
3487	Lee, I'll rev up the Austin facility agreement again.
3487	Eric tells me that we arefine with adding the additional TD of I to the facility agreement with a scope/price change.
3487	Ignore the insurance certificate question.
3487	My bad.
3487	I've heard that the LOC made it, so GE should be receiving payment in fulltoday.
3487	LV Co Gen is still moving.
3487	There are some of the TurboPark stuff which wasin the agreed form of override letter.
3487	It is being actively worked right now.
3487	Sorry about your trip.
3487	Kay
3488	Looks good.
3488	Jake Thomas signed for us, so signature block on our executed version has him instead.
3489	Please confirm that GE's originals of the documents they signed should be sent to: Lee Johnson GE Packaged Power, Inc. Thanks, Kay
3490	Thank you so much.
3490	We promise to be good ambassadors for LAS.
3490	Kay
3491	Herman, this is the document I called you about.
3491	AE is out-of-pocket, and has some questions about this agreement, so she asked me to forward the doc.
3491	This is a doc for a 40 yr ground lease for a power plant.
3491	It is my understanding that the counterparty is not interested in an option arrangement.
3491	Kay
3492	call me on my cell 713 304 8716
3493	I would like to move to the new garage.
3493	Thanks, Kay Mann
3494	The memo was very helpful.
3494	It would be great to meet in person and discuss issues.
3494	I'm out of town now, but I believe either the 8th or 9th would be great.
3494	Thanks, Kay
3495	John, I suggest eliminating the statement in III that we are proposing to perform the the market price servises in accordance with the terms of the market price service agreement.
3495	I realized that we have a disclaimer at the end of the letter, but the statement in III seems to directly contradict the disclaimer.
3495	I am not confident that the statement that the Enron structure is proprietary is sufficient to protect the information.
3495	I will need to check the confidentiality agreement when I get to the office if this is a real concern.
3495	I thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid.
3495	Is there anything in the RFP which indicates that any proposal will be considered a firm offer, or anything to that effect?
3495	Talk to you soon, Kay
3496	Hi Steve, Good to hear from you.
3496	Your right, my job is completely different.
3496	Funny how things evolve like that.
3496	I love it, though.
3496	Very few hurt/sick/deceased folks.
3496	Paige is finishing her junior year at Southwestern, and Michael is in kindergarten at St Francis.
3496	We are very blessed.
3496	Hope all is well with your family.
3496	Kay
3497	deal killer
3498	Sounds fine.
3498	Kay
3499	Perhaps it is operator error on this end, but I couldn't get this going.
3499	Kay
3500	Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted.
3500	Evidently, we decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two alternatives.
3500	(not what I was lead to believe before.) I spoke with John about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for a transaction.
3500	Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in the letter were not great protection.
3500	Kay
3501	Sounds like gas to me.
3501	Kay
3502	I'd really appreciate it.
3502	Thanks, Kay
3503	Great.
3503	I'll come around in a bit and fill you in. Kay
3504	1400 Smith.
3504	Morning would probably be better for me.
3504	Kay
3505	Business casual is the order of the day here.
3505	Ties are definitely not necessary.
3505	Are you spending the night downtown?
3505	If so, you may want to just park at the hotel.
3505	Lots of the streets downtown are under construction, so I'm a little hesitant to give directions.
3505	Enron is located fairly close to the Hyatt, and their garage is easy to find.
3505	Enron just opened a new parking garage, but I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.
3505	Alternatively, the Allen Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.
3505	If it was me and I was working and staying downtown, I would take a taxi.
3505	This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction, and partly because of the construction downtown.
3505	Hope this helps.
3505	Kay
3506	I accused Carlos of being a deal killer.
3507	Count me in.
3508	How about commercial folks?
3509	FYI.
3509	Certain aspects of this presentation will relate to PPA's/tolling agreements/interconnection studies and agreements relating to Enron developed generation assets from which we intend to purchase power, etc. The cost/benefit would probably be marginal for you, but I will be there, and will get you any interesting handouts.
3509	Kay
3510	I can give up my seat and sit in with the commercial team, if that helps.
3511	Team, I think we should make a list of issues today (Pete will be a big help).
3511	If we are to the point of deciding critical issues, I believe Sheila's input is essential, and worth waiting for.
3512	I'd still like to sit in when my commercial team hears it, if possible.
3512	Plus, I suspect we run the risk this week of getting very bogged down.
3513	The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu Zisman.
3513	The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I think this one is more helpful.
3513	I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as selling power.
3513	I found this one helpful for issue identification and exculpatory language, however.
3513	Kay
3514	Wilson Montjoy will be in our offices, probably starting around 830 or 900.
3514	Any progress?
3514	Kay
3515	No, I believe it is one of TECO's subs, but I'm not sure.
3516	This gives you the gist of it.
3516	Since it was a GE generated letter I will need to check for the final hard copy.
3517	Eric, Did you have any comments on the turbine contract for Austin that I sent you?
3517	Obviously, before we can execute a change order we have to execute a contract.
3517	Thanks, Kay
3518	Hi Pete, We will want to get the CofA contract fixed up shortly.
3518	I don't remember if we have addressed these issues.
3518	I do think that GE may resist the combined cycle language, and I don't suggest including it.
3518	Eric, can you still live with that?
3518	Thanks, Kay
3519	Hi John, I left you a voice mail, but thought I'd try email as well.
3519	The language that they added to paragraph 6 raises some issues since they want to restrict ENA and its affiliates from future potential transactions.
3519	Please call me at your convenience to discuss.
3519	Thanks, Kay
3520	Looks like we should see if Lee is ready to go on this one.
3520	Kay
3521	Refresh my recollection.
3521	Did we (Enron and Northwestern) agree to the form of the escrow agreement?
3521	If so, then we will need to see if the escrow agent has any comments.
3521	Chris is on vacation, ciaoing down in Italy (sorry, couldn't resist).
3521	He should be the point man, though.
3521	On the Delta deal we ran into some complications in moving money because Citibank had the money invested in a money market account.
3521	Does the current draft allow for that?
3521	I guess the easiest thing to do is to send it to me and let me see what's up.
3521	Thanks, Kay
3522	Looks like Friday will work.
3523	Please put it on my calendar so I won't forget.
3523	thanks ckm
3524	You know I just can't remember that far in advance!
3525	Probably the week of July 4th.
3526	Nothing better than a FREE trip to SF.
3526	Where will you stay?
3527	Good suggestion.
3527	Why don't you run it by George, and if you get positive feedback I'll suggest it to Ben.
3527	Kay
3528	Hi Ben, IMHO, your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting issues.
3528	Legal should have a bit more of a developed (and probably current) understanding of how to address the issues.
3528	Between Development and Legal, we should be able to get docs about 90% there.
3528	We then take the almost compliant docs to Accting/Finance for fine tuning.
3528	A key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good download of information from Acct/Finance to the Development group.
3528	We had one yesterday for Legal, and it was helpful.
3528	I want to sit in when your troops get the presentation, if at all possible, because I can help translate on both sides, I believe.
3528	I also want to make sure that Development and Legal are on the same page.
3528	Fire drill avoidance is a key objective.
3528	Look forward to discussing in detail.
3528	Kay
3529	Hi.
3529	Happy Mother's Day.
3529	I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family event on that Saturday, as hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.
3529	Doesn't sound like that's happening.
3529	I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't surprise me if we headed up Sat am.
3529	That's Memorial Day weekend, so traffic out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.
3529	Neil and I haven't discussed any details yet, though.
3529	Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.
3529	No pay, which is a bad thing.
3529	She is currently on the way to Colorado with some friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.
3529	I haven't even mentioned Mac's graduation yet.
3529	I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will resume a more normal pace.
3529	I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend, maybe clean out a closet.
3529	I have the urge to purge.
3529	I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.
3529	It must be a recessive characteristic.
3529	It is great that the girls have different arenas in which to excel.
3529	I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.
3529	Hope it gets there.
3529	No clue on what to get Mac.
3529	I guess I should ask Paige for ideas.
3529	If I get some good ones from her or Mikey I'll let you know.
3529	Love, Kay
3530	Another point: How do we price gas/power we sell to them, especially in light of our duty of good faith and fair dealing?
3530	Not expecting an answer via email, this is just a topic for further discussion.
3531	Herman and Rose, Thank you so much for the presentation yesterday concerning accounting/financing issues in power development projects.
3531	The presentation was extremely clear and informative.
3531	The whole group stayed interested, which is a tribute to your preparation and delivery.
3531	Kay
3532	Hi Ben, How's about the Acccounting/Finance presentation at noon on May 23rd, then we can all go to the Astros' game at 305?
3532	Kay
3533	How about 100?
3534	I think you'd better stick close to home and smile when she gets back.
3535	Please calendar for me.
3536	I'm planning on going.
3536	It should go without saying that you are welcome also.
3536	Kay
3537	What do you think?
3537	Kay
3538	I don't know anything about Shelby, but I take it that you don't think it impacts Haywood at this late date.
3538	Kay
3539	Looks fine to me.
3539	Kay
3540	John still wants to hold off on a document review, as we don't know if we want to go forward.
3540	Kay
3541	Those bizness whites are the best.
3542	Gentlemen, Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?
3542	I would appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.
3542	I have the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.
3542	Thanks, Kay PS.
3542	I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.
3542	I can probably work my schedule so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.
3543	Wilson, Good morning.
3543	What is your availability this week for a conference call with David?
3543	Thanks, Kay
3544	Hi Jeff, Did you want Stacy to take a look at this?
3544	Kay
3545	Hi there, I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.
3545	I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with NW.
3545	Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus on the current form of escrow agreement.
3545	Once we have that, Enron (Chris) will make contact with Citibank.
3545	Thanks, Kay
3546	Hi John, Enron is ok with signing the consents.
3546	After the assignment of the contracts out of LLCs, we would like to exercise our put.
3546	Please share this info with George.
3546	I believe Ben will be in town tomorrow (right Ben?) so we can get it signed up this week.
3546	Thanks, Kay
3547	How does this look?
3547	Kay
3548	John, I made the changes you suggested.
3548	The prior version contained a non-circumvention (you can't pursue the project without me) versus the current exclusivity (you must work only with me), which seems somewhat more restrictive since it would keep us from bringing in additional participants.
3548	I've changed language in the next paragraph to avoid a contradiction.
3548	If we go with this approach then I suspect we will want to work on an LOI which divides up responsibility going forward.
3548	Let me know what you think.
3548	Kay
3549	Are you available any time this week?
3549	We are getting down to the nitty gritty.
3549	Kay
3550	Hi there.
3550	Do you have to be a licensed claims handler (or a lawyer) to handle a third party's insurance claim?
3550	Same for selling insurance?
3550	Thanks,
3551	I do recall the conversations you and I had (actually a series of pages, I believe), so I'll check with Rebecca and see if she still has those signature pages.
3551	Kay
3552	FYI.
3552	I've reviewing at Heather's request.
3552	Kay
3553	Gentlemen, I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.
3553	The proposed transaction is described as follows: A potential power plant site development and asset management services related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal 365 MW combined cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, Massachusetts.
3553	The current draft of the CA contains this language: From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without the participation of the other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other Party that it does not intend to pursue the Proposed Transaction.
3553	In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your review.
3553	John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.
3553	My extension is 57566.
3553	Thank you, Kay Here is the entire CA:
3554	I've received error notices, so I'm trying again.
3554	Kay
3555	I thought of you yesterday.
3555	I planted an eggplant plant and a pepper plant.
3555	What a great weekend - I lived outside.
3555	What about you?
3556	Hi Catherine, Would it be appropriate for me to call Karl or someone to try to get the original docs?
3556	I have this urge to get something off of my "to do" list, and this looks like a good candidate.
3556	Thanks, Kay
3557	It is Carlos' territory.
3557	Please review for compliance with this month's rules.
3557	Thanks, Kay
3558	Carolyn, GE is calling for the original turbine contract.
3558	I believe I previously provided Lee Johnson's address.
3558	Could you send him an original?
3558	Thanks, Kay
3559	I've tried sending this 3 times.
3559	Please see if you can figure out the problem.
3559	I've used the autoaddressing and his long internet address.
3559	If all else fails, just print and have it delivered, I guess, or send it to his assistant.
3559	Thanks, Kay
3560	Tom, I agree that this helps.
3560	We can also put something in to indicate that the price we sell to them may not be the same price we bought from a third party, depending on market conditions.
3560	Something like that.
3560	Kay
3561	three glitches He probably just changed over to Outlook
3562	Hi Dale, Did you just do a tolling agreement re: LV?
3562	I'm looking for forms, and thought I'd check.
3562	Thanks, Kay
3563	Nothing fatal.
3563	Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general consideration: 2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping.
3563	I've previously been advised that Corp performs this function.
3563	Issues which arise: will the money be invested overnight, who has signature authority, etc. We have a draft services agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a "go by" if you decide you need a separate doc.
3563	2.2 (b)Billing/collection.
3563	Responsibility generally should stop at sending nastygrams.
3563	No duty to hire lawyers, etc. 2.2 (f) Insurance.
3563	In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance and adjust claims.
3563	Current language may be soft enough to not violate licensing laws.
3563	2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.
3563	2.3 Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.
3563	3.2 If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.
3563	It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency role.
3563	(may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer yet?
3563	Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are they on their own?
3563	Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions (sounds silly)?
3563	Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?
3563	3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to "day of" transactions.
3563	3.4 last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?
3563	Assume Owner has transmission risk?
3563	Is there a "no third party beneficiary" clause?
3563	I might have missed it.
3563	Not life or death.
3563	Interesting structure.
3563	Could I get a copy of the final document?
3563	Thanks, Kay
3564	Me too.
3564	It is my filing system.
3565	Carolyn, Your approach makes perfect sense to me, but I think Lee wants his turbinecontract sooner.
3565	I still haven't received the finance stuff yet.
3565	I've asked again today.
3565	Kay
3566	Hi Ben, I've been working on the letter, but I've got to fill in a bunch of blanks before it is finished (proper names, etc.) Depends on how complete you want it to be.
3566	I've got to check to see if this is the final version we agreed to.
3566	It is very close.
3567	Here's the version NorthWestern approved.
3567	Letter to follow...
3567	Kay
3568	In addition, we can add language that says we are specifically not prohibited from.......
3568	and list what we care about.
3568	Kay
3569	Hi Rebecca, I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.
3569	These were the docs that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.
3569	These signed pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.
3569	To you remember if you brought them to me before?
3569	I haven't really searched - I thought I would ask first.
3569	Thanks, Kay
3570	Is this what you were thinking about?
3571	Tam Pham, ma'am.
3571	Thanks for the clue!
3572	Hi Stacy, I don't know if Jeff or Debra mentioned this to you, but this is a master we need in place in connection with a gas/power asset management arrangement with the cities of Yazoo City and Clarksdale Mississippi.
3572	As you can see, Jeff suggested you take a look at it before it is sent to the customer.
3572	Thanks, Kay
3573	I figured it would.
3573	The master is now in the hands (or on the email) of Stacy Dickson, one of the gas lawyers.
3573	Let's see if we hear anything by noon.
3573	Kay
3574	ps.
3574	You might warn Bob P. that this is coming, and needs top attention.
3574	We can send it to his lawyer at the same time, if he wants.
3574	I think it is someone other than David, though.
3574	Can you find out who he wants to receive the draft?
3574	Thanks, Kay
3575	fyi.
3575	Stacy just got the draft this am.
3575	Gotta love the passion.
3576	Can we swap days with Charlotte and go tomorrow?
3576	We need her to pick up Michael if we are going to go together.
3577	It is worth a try, but it would be unusually generous of the power systems group to go along without push back.
3577	At least now we will see where we stand.
3577	Did Herman leave you a voice mail telling you that getting GE to sign off like this wouldn't do the trick?
3577	I'm guessing you've decided to appeal.
3577	Kay
3578	I will.
3579	John, I noticed a different file name on this draft than the version Pete Thompson sent out.
3579	How is this version different from Pete's?
3579	I sure hate to have more than one version of this monster being vetted at the same time.
3579	Thanks,
3580	Wilson, You should get a call from Suzanne, my assistant.
3580	We're trying to set things up for Thursday am.
3580	How does that look?
3580	Kay
3581	Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in the loop on its status.
3581	We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested an alternative structure.
3581	In response, Navigant issued questions.
3581	John Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.
3581	We (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as to whether we will be going forward.
3581	I believe Klauberg has either cleared conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.
3581	I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.
3581	Kay
3582	Herman Manis will need the opportunity to review, also.
3583	Opps.
3583	I didn't notice C Sherman's name.
3583	I'm unclear as to whether Herman needs it also.
3584	Hi Matt, I understand that John Rigby sent you a draft of the standard turbine contract.
3584	Just thought you should know that it will be a E-Next type doc.
3584	Thanks, Kay
3585	Hi there.
3585	I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to Tax and Insurance.
3585	I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.
3585	We are getting so close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.
3585	I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the current list of issues under consideration.
3585	I suggest we work through this list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's comments.
3585	We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to review it at that time.
3585	Kay
3586	Please prepare Sheila and I notebooks with the following emails and attachments printed (all located in my GE General email folder): Stephen Swift May 10 re warranty Stephen Swift May 10 re performance tests Thompson May 10 issues list Thompson May 11 Agreement version 4 Thompson May 11 Exhibits Thanks!
3586	Kay
3587	Sheila and I discussed using the time at 130 CDT for an internal discussion, bringing her up-to-speed on the issues and discussing action items.
3587	Nothing set in concrete, though.
3587	Kay
3588	I have Michael's name pinned on my bulletin board at work, so he is in my thoughts and prayers daily.
3588	Good luck!
3588	Kay
3589	John, After considerning what you told me about the job (and what you didn't tell me), I've decided to decline the job you aren't offering me.
3589	Kay
3590	FYI, I have a call with Wilson and David scheduled for Thursday am.
3591	I'll defer to Sheila on timing.
3592	FYI.
3592	Maybe I should take this project if we want to keep AE.
3592	Kay
3593	Looks like 200 Friday, May 18th for a status/download meeting.
3593	Suz, please find a room and notify folks and their assistants.
3593	Thanks, Kay
3594	I have 30 minutes at 930 (1000am meeting)
3595	I think we need an internal review to develop responses to positions as outlined in PT's memo.
3595	Kay
3596	Hi there, We need the exact name of the YC entity which will be buying the gas.
3596	Is it Yazoo City or the YCPC, or what?
3596	Same info is required for Clarksdale, although not as urgently.
3596	If you will email me the addresses of all who need to review this, the YC contract will be ready tomorrow.
3596	Thanks, Kay
3597	Absolutely.
3598	I took a crack at tightening up the E Next assignment language as it exists in the overrides, for inclusion in WH form: Peter, could you take first cut at the override letter?
3598	We may be having an internal meeting at 930 central, and if so, will you be available by phone if necessary?
3598	Suz, please put the attachment in the notebook.
3598	Thanks, Kay
3599	I have a conflict at 130.
3599	Rose has been reliable at showing up and participating, so I suggest that she be included, although it sounds like she 'll be with John.
3600	Anytime 9-11 Friday if fine.
3601	Between 11-130; 215-400 today, almost anytime Friday, other than 2-3.
3602	Hi Kara, Michael has been seeing a speech/language therapist, and recently she raised an issue about Michael's ability to "blend and unblend" sounds in words, specifically as it relates to reading readiness.
3602	She had this conversation with Neil, so I don't know the details.
3602	We are meeting with her today to get more input, but I wanted to mention it to you, just in case you had a comment.
3602	I know this is something we can discuss at Michael's conference on May 31st, but if you would like to discuss it before hand, I can be reached at 713 304 8716 9 (cell), 713 345 -7566 (office - just tell my asst you are Michael's Thanks so much, Kay
3603	I knew you would figuer out something!
3604	Otra mas.
3604	We'll need to change the date of the doc once we have an idea of when it will be signed.
3604	Kay
3605	Taking asset management to a new level of pain.
3605	Commericial vision is to form a joint venture with NRG to manage a portfolio of generation assets.
3605	I'm meeting with Janelle et al at 10:00 to discuss what we want to do.
3605	Kay
3606	I suggested yesterday that you ask Sheila about the timeframe, and you told me you would just go ahead and do it.
3606	I'll just tell her it isnt' ready.
3606	It doesn't matter to me.
3606	Kay
3607	I think that's fine.
3608	Thanks for the note.
3608	I was wondering about that.
3609	no more than an hour.
3610	Yes.
3611	Wow.
3611	I haven't seen Dan like that.
3611	Thanks for the books.
3612	I don't remember a PPA for Homestead.
3612	I'll check, though.
3612	Kay
3613	I'm remembering now.
3613	It was a term sheet which was never executed, as far as I know.
3613	I believe FPL prepared it, and we may have commented on it.
3613	Let me see what I can find.
3613	Kay
3614	I've made some revisions the Bill's document to make sure we are on the same page before I prepare the LOI.
3614	Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
3614	Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?
3614	Thanks, Kay
3615	Ben, Here's what you requested.
3615	I do not recommend this MOU, as there are several problems with it, Is there something I can help you with?
3615	Kay
3616	Are you here?
3616	I wanted to get those Intergen consents done and out of the way.
3616	Also, DDuran needs to sign the Northwestern guaranty (Oz signed but they want more copies), and I thought it would be best if you initialled.
3617	Well, aren't you hangin' with the big dogs.
3617	No big deal.
3617	Kay
3618	fyi.
3618	Don't know if any of your folks ever attend this kind of thing.
3618	Kay
3619	I'll give it a look.
3620	Hi Carlos, Just a reminder that you emails may be discoverable, especially when you include any "lay person" other than Ben.
3620	I know you know this, but as a former trial type, I just can't help myself.
3620	Kay
3621	We aren't required to, but I don't see a downside to sending it.
3622	We need a confidentiality agreement relating to asset management services for Intergen.
3622	We may have a confidentiality agreement in place - please check with K Young.
3622	It probably won't cover this.
3622	Plus, I think this should be in the name of EPMI - Reagan, what do you think?
3622	Thanks, Kay
3623	This is still very early in the process, but some thought as to structure options for earning recognition might be worthwhile.
3623	Kay
3624	Herman, I mentioned the bridge loan, and Ben was concerned that it might be difficult to get that done before the end of Q2.
3624	A topic for Friday.
3624	Kay
3625	Hi KC, It would be a big help if you could take the NorthWestern guaranty sig pages to Marissa after D Duran has signed them.
3625	Thanks, Kay
3626	Fairley loves Bill Bryant.
3626	However, Bill have given us some bad advice re: Florida siting act.
3626	Marchris has the authority to hire who he wants to on regulatory side, but I wouldn't touch him for deal counsel.
3626	Sheila has details.
3626	Kay
3627	It will take me awhile to find it.
3627	Please ask Linda Simmons.
3628	Hi there.
3628	I have not received my password yet.
3628	Do I use the one from the end of 2000?
3628	Thanks, Kay
3629	Can't think of anyone.
3630	By the way, Bryant's bill should go to Marchris, not you.
3630	Marchris will know that.
3631	Did Steve S ask that it be added to the list?
3631	I would let them bring it up if he didn't.
3631	We spent quite a bit of time and effort on the LOL clause, and it was subject to lots of give and take.
3631	Kay
3632	Doug, Here's the revised CA.
3632	I highlighted the changed terms.
3632	In addition, I deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a prior CA.
3632	I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same, but obviously I left that for you to determine.
3632	I expect that the Enron entity which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity.
3632	I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity of the issues, and I added 6 months to the term since things won't get cranked up for a while.
3632	I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.
3632	Have a good weekend.
3632	Kay
3633	Please prepare a bcc on the Siemens letter as indicated below.
3634	I will be impressed if they can close by July 15, when they don't have their financing lined up on May 18.
3634	Oh well.
3634	I'll send the assignment doc to JS via email.
3634	Ben, I'll be down shortly.
3634	Kay
3635	I would like to attend.
3635	Thanks, Kay
3636	Tell him he is dropping to the B list.
3636	It was sent via fax to her.
3636	Kay
3637	I like your letter.
3638	Please print two originals of this CA (in my CA directory) InterGen North America CA May 18 rev 1.
3638	Thanks, Kay
3639	I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.
3639	Herman, I dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little with the 1st paragraph.
3639	I also construed your comment regarding Enron's right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty is in default.
3639	Please confirm that this is acceptable.
3639	Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.
3639	Please advise if you have any comments.
3639	Kay
3640	This look ok?
3640	It will be presented to Dave Duran to execute Monday am unless you suggest otherwise.
3640	Kay
3641	This is the most recent thing I have from GE specifically on LOL and indemnity.
3641	Our memories appear to be correct this time, unless I'm missing something from my file.
3641	Kay
3642	Here's a rough cut.
3642	Let me know what you think.
3642	The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the units.
3642	These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions, noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.
3642	In addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is capable of producing the required output without outages.
3642	The final test protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.
3642	Heather: There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.
3642	If it has been, we could make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.
3642	I'm sure Ric knows.
3642	Kay
3643	Hi Stuart, I believe the plant manager was going to call someone at SW, to keep the communication lines open.
3643	I'll be glad to draft a friendly letter to follow up.
3643	Kay
3644	9.6 Additional Factory Testing .
3644	In the event that Purchaser reasonably determines that a factory test conducted by Seller or its Subcontractors was not conducted properly or theresults of the test were inconclusive Purchaser may required Seller to repeat such test in a fashion as to obtain conclusive results.
3644	Purchaser may request Seller or its Subcontractors to perform one or more of its factory tests using more precise instrumentation than planned, or conduct a test not in Seller,s or its Subcontractor,s standard factory test program.
3644	In the case of a Purchaser request for an additional non standardfactory test the conduct of such test shall be subject to mutual agreement by the parties.
3644	In the event as a result of such Purchaser requested repeat test, ormore precise instrumentation or non standard test the Equipment is found to notbe compliant with the requirements of this Agreement, Seller shall correctsuch noncompliance and the cost and time associated with such testing shallbe to Seller,s account.
3644	If the Equipment is found to be compliant with this Agreement, Seller shall be eligible for a Change Orderfor the cost and timeassociated with such testing.
3645	Reagan, I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.
3645	Yazoo has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.
3645	The power side is a bit more complicated.
3645	Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be bought by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an issue) or by the individual Cities.
3645	Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.
3645	Kay
3646	Thanks.
3647	I'll discuss with Carlos.
3648	I'm leaving now anyway.
3649	Ben, I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.
3649	Hope the kids cut you some slack after your late night.
3649	You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.
3649	It was 65 degress this am.
3649	I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be wonderful in this weather.
3649	Next comes 90 degrees.
3649	Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills assessment to put them on teams.
3649	He loved it.
3649	His big sister and her boyfriend took him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.
3649	He is wearing his shin guards and soccer shorts to school today.
3649	Too cute.
3649	Hope you are enjoying your little ones.
3649	Kay
3650	Hi David, Either email or handwritten works for me.
3650	I would just as soon have everything now, if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow.
3650	In discussing the extension yesterday, the consensus was that we should extend until June 29th.
3650	If the deal gets done sooner, we can always have the new doc supercede the old one.
3650	I'm copying Heather and Reagan so that they can let me know if I've got it wrong.
3650	Thanks, Kay
3651	One point you were checking was the CA.
3651	Any luck?
3651	I called pulled off track on a couple of things, but I can get back to this now.
3651	Billy Fleenor says he has some thoughts on structure from a M-to-M standpoint.
3651	Are you guys interested in having that conversation at this time?
3651	Kay
3652	Please advise if you think this is ready to go to GE.
3653	If Carlos has reviewed it I don't need to comment.
3654	Since AEWhite will be out of the office for the next two and a half weeks, I've volunteered for to cover her power development work in Florida.
3654	Just in case you don't have my numbers: office 713 345 7566 home 713 973 6325 cell As a heads up, I believe Rose Engeldorf, the Global Finance lawyer who helps us process documents, will be on vacation beginning June 2.
3654	Anything which may need to be blessed can probable be done a bit more easily before Rose leaves.
3654	Thanks, Kay
3655	Here's a free look at someone else's deal.
3655	I don't know what role Enron has in the deal after sell down.
3655	Kay
3656	Hi there, I need to get with Lee Johnson on another deal, and I know he will ask about LV CoGen.
3656	Anything I should tell him?
3656	Thanks, Kay
3657	Do you know if we had TECO sign a confidentiality agreement?
3657	Who is the counterparty to the participation agreement?
3657	I thought we were just sending out the public documents.
3657	Thanks, Kay
3658	Hello.
3658	I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled out the form for the match.
3658	Please advise if this has been paid, as they are sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.
3658	Thank you, Kay Mann
3659	Anything posted on DealBench?
3660	Lisa, I haven't gotten the executed docs back, but I'll send you the electronic version if that works for you.
3660	Timing is as follows: Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.
3660	If the closing does not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.
3660	10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days later.
3660	If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment, which we are working on now.
3660	I've given this timeline without looking at the doc, so I will let you know if I missed something.
3660	Hopes this helps.
3660	Kay
3661	Did you tell her yes yes yes?
3662	Bad Kay bad bad bad Kay.
3662	I'll do it now.
3663	I have a tolling arrangement to work on.
3663	I'm trying to get my hands on the Black Hills tolling agreement.
3663	Can someone point me in the right direction to find it?
3663	Thanks, Kay
3664	I'm on a conference call.
3664	Could you call Charlotte ASAP and review the plan for tonight.
3664	Paige is in her car if you need her input.
3665	This PPA has a good overview of scheduling of power (no gas element), and was fully vetted with the power group.
3666	Hi John, I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern.
3666	In connection with that transaction, we have prepared the attached assignment and consent, which is patterned after the Pastoria form.
3666	We would like to get it wrapped up in the next two weeks, if possible.
3666	Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions.
3667	I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).
3667	Don't know who they will have on this one.
3667	I'm off to the Astros, but would like to visit with you tomorrow, if you will be around.
3667	Thanks, Kay
3668	Greg, You can call me on whatever you have, including Midway, SDEC and Medley Dunn.
3668	If I have a problem getting to something, I'll find help.
3668	Kay
3669	Here's what we sent them.
3670	I wouldn't use an LLC with an prior history.
3670	We might have to get the old stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.
3670	If the LLC paid for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.
3670	I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!
3671	Question for the team: If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?
3671	If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with some low dollar hard costs?
3671	I don't have anything in particular in mind, it is more of a theoretical question.
3671	Thanks, Kay
3672	How much is it and should this be the final amount?
3672	One thought I have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, which is enough to cover the expenditures.
3672	Don't know if this works, but it is one thought.
3672	What do you think?
3672	Kay
3673	I'm on the phone with GE.
3673	Their initial response to the assignment stuff is positive.
3673	They want a letter which sets out the ownership of the LLC and what we are doing on payment.
3673	I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300, depending on this call.
3673	Kay
3674	Steve Swift and Jeff Darst, although Jeff is off the call now.
3675	I was waiting but he did not bring it up.
3675	Probably saving it.
3676	YIKES.
3677	At the risk of making you crazy, I've come up with a suggested rework of the term sheet, as I was having horrible problems with formatting when I was doing revisions.
3677	Now all I have to do is fill in the blanks.
3677	I'm ready when you are.
3678	Could you email me the option agreement?
3679	I'm working.
3679	Not a choice, a necessity.
3679	Good night to grill...
3680	I've skimmed it.
3680	I see that the option expires August 9th.
3680	Are we planning to renew it?
3680	If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.
3680	Might take too long to address the immediate issue.
3680	I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it would be considered a down payment).
3680	Just fyi.
3680	Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?
3680	I'm just wondering what is public info.
3680	Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his vote.
3680	More to come...
3681	Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement: How are we setting the heat rate?
3681	Do we have the GADS (?)?
3681	Is it a daily average, weekly average?
3681	Flat rate?
3681	Adjusted?
3681	If so, how often?
3681	Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
3681	We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
3681	We aren't making money on gas, right?
3681	Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?
3681	Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?
3681	It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae: The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.
3681	Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?
3681	How are we setting the bogey?
3681	Formula?
3681	Subject to audit?
3681	Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
3681	What is defn of profit?
3681	I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.
3681	What costs are included on the buy and sell side?
3681	Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.
3681	Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.
3681	What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?
3681	Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
3681	It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.
3681	Thanks, Kay
3682	One project co is good enough.
3683	Gentlemen, I've been told that the parties have agreed to extend the letter agreement until June 15, and that we will have a signed long term document by then.
3683	David, I would think I simple letter agreement should work.
3683	I can get it working from here.
3683	I'm working on what was the most recent form that I had re the long term deal, which should address some of David's issues.
3683	I'm not sure yet when I'll have it done, but it has moved up the list of priorities.
3683	Talk to you soon, I'm sure.
3683	Kay
3684	Hi.
3684	Did the CA get signed and sent, and did it come back?
3684	Thanks, Kay
3685	Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.
3685	If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.
3685	Don't ask me to splain that, because I can't.
3685	If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.
3685	However, one thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are with our financing vehicle.
3685	I don't know if the land has to be clean before it can go into the vehicle.
3685	I can ask.
3685	If it is required to be clean, then you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.
3685	Kay PS.
3685	Feel like Alice in Wonderland yet?
3686	Okey dokey.
3687	As far as I know the commissioning period we have in the current LM contracts still works for the LMs.
3687	I haven't heard any differently.
3687	You just plugthose things in, right Scott?
3687	From the owner/power seller standpoint, the predictability is more importanthan the time period (within reason, of course).
3687	No matte what we have onLDs with GE, the penalty for not moving megawatts will be more.
3687	As for standard of conduct, do we have language in the warranty section abohow the service techs have to work?
3687	Maybe something similiar would be work?
3687	The discussion shows that it is a good idea to get them committed to performing the TD of I at the time we sign up to buy the turbines.
3688	Way cool.
3688	I'd let Reagan follow up.
3689	Don't know the answers.
3689	We need to visit with Herman Manis to get his buy-in on an approach.
3689	I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll ask.
3689	Are you in Houston today?
3690	Didn't really deal with her.
3691	Hi Greg, The agreement isn't attached.
3691	(I do that ALL the time.)
3692	Looks like 230 today is good for all three of us re: option issues.
3692	We will meet in Herman's office on 33.
3692	Kay
3693	Who will/can sign the turbine contract for Enron?
3693	Thanks, Kay
3694	More: We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included as an exhibit.
3694	What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?
3694	Do we still want a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?
3694	Do we want it now?
3694	Thanks, Kay
3695	1.
3695	Need details re item 1 below.
3695	Please suggest language (band of acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.
3695	6.
3695	Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?
3695	7.
3695	Bogey calc only addresses gas.
3695	What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?
3695	Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?
3695	Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is.
3695	I did a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn to locate it.
3695	Thanks, Kay
3696	Question: Do we have a schedule of assets to be involved in the transaction?
3696	I recall that Janelle had some stuff that wasn't on the list.
3696	Thanks, Kay
3697	calendar, please
3698	Here's the first draft re the deal which needs structuring help: Please let me know when you are available to meet on this.
3698	Thanks, Kay
3699	check out q and a #2 below.
3700	They all have it now.
3700	I thought you would enjoy this one.
3700	Did you hear about the protest in Enron's Chicago office.
3700	40 ACORN members stormed in, demanding that Gregg Penman fax a letter to Ken Lay.
3700	No kidding.
3701	I've volunteered Kathleen to help process the paper.
3702	The other deal I did with TECO had the same inhouse lawyer.
3702	He's just fine.
3703	Glad I gave you such a GLOWING review.
3704	How depressing would it be to be at EECC?
3705	Not a word.
3706	Hi Wilson, We discussed asking the counterparties for opinion letters.
3706	Could you outline what you think we should ask for, or alternatively, just draft it?
3706	Thanks, Kay
3707	Absolutely.
3707	Kay
3708	Please print all attachments and make a folder: Tolling (Enron tolling).
3708	Thanks, Kay
3709	Hi there, I would like to have one email with electronic versions of the letter agreement, and all the attachments except the turbine contract.
3709	Thanks, Kay
3710	Here's a first draft of the NRG loi.
3710	Kay
3711	Thanks.
3711	Did I tell you that I spoke with GE about the assignment, and their initial response was very positive.
3711	NorthWestern is predicting closing in July.
3711	Kay
3712	Wouldn't it be nice to not have a fire drill at the end?
3712	At least we will be ready.
3712	I'm can't wait to see what their lenders will come up with.
3712	Ben's hoping it will fall through and he can sell these again, I think.
3712	Kay
3713	Yes, E-Next.
3713	You might advise Jeff that we will probably need a substitute Kay
3714	You might check the letter agreement re escrow and see what it says.
3715	never received a pass word.
3716	Hi Kara, I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the meeting.
3716	We can discuss next week at our conference.
3716	We are arranging to have Michael re-tested.
3716	I think it is more of an issue of a difference between potential and performance.
3716	Michael has been tested in the past, and tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which don't match up.
3716	At least that's how I understand it.
3716	He just has some disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not understanding it all.
3716	I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.
3716	After I dropped him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that opportunity.
3716	I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a great job of getting the kids prepared.
3716	Thanks for everything, and see you next week!
3716	Kay
3717	My suggestions:
3718	Schedule reflects amount due for cancellation on or before the stated dates?
3719	When I was at the site it said that it had sent a new password to me at kay.mann@enron.com.
3719	Didn't get here.
3719	I give up.
3720	I don't understand the last sentence.
3721	It is too big for Ben.
3721	Maybe Dave Duran?
3722	Here's how I would do it.
3722	(llc and its permitted assignees hereinafter referred to as "Optionee"), a____________________________________, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability, This is consistent with option.
3722	Revise like this and send out again to Herman.
3722	thanks
3723	Hi Ben, I've given it a quick look.
3723	Looks a lot different from when I last saw it.
3723	I don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 2 a.
3723	Was there another fix agreed to by all (maybe the "as required by law" language?) Also, any idea why the service charge language was deleted in b?
3723	Maybe it isn't a problem.
3723	Also, do you have a copyy of the site plan approval?
3723	Talk to you soon, Kay
3724	Tough question.
3724	What happens if they don't pay their legal bills?
3724	Won't they have difficulty closing?
3724	We can pay their consulting fee up front.
3724	Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.
3724	What is our concern?
3724	They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to, and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable.
3724	Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.
3724	I'm sure they've thought of that all ready.
3724	I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.
3724	I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.
3724	Kay
3725	1st thing 1st.
3725	Here's a draft of the extension letter: Kay
3726	Herman blessed this letter, but I think it needs to pass through your hands also.
3726	Kay
3727	I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the ILA until June 15.
3727	I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought I would give you a heads up.
3727	David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.
3727	If you have your preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.
3727	Thanks, Kay PS The salutation is to "Gentlemen".
3727	Are the members of the commission and MDEA all men?
3727	I don't want to commit a blunder.
3728	Congrats!
3728	I sent this on to the lawyer for Global Finance (TurboPark team), also, as part of SOP.
3729	yes, yes, and yes.
3729	You're on a roll....
3730	print job, please.
3730	How was your weekend?
3730	I had a good one.
3731	What is your preference when there is a conflict between the interim agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.
3731	(For instance, the definition of ancillary services.) Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it represent the customers' expectations?
3731	Kay
3732	It needs to be sent to Lisa Bills, Roseann Engeldorf, and Ben Jacoby for approval.
3732	Thanks, Kay
3733	I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.
3734	This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.
3734	It is amazing how things have changed.
3734	Did you know that they now tell you to have babies sleep on their backs?
3734	That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.
3734	It was hard to get used to.
3734	Kay
3735	So have you figured out how to use the portal from home?
3735	I just discovered it yesterday (while at the office).
3735	We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation, which was fine.
3735	Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse, which was wonderful.
3735	Yesterday I cooked, shopped, and puttered in the yard.
3735	Got the last caladium bulbs in the ground.
3735	I like to wait until they are on sale.
3735	The weekend just flew by.
3735	"They" say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome.
3735	Go figure.
3735	At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep.
3735	Car seats, strollers and diapers are 100x better now.
3735	Especially the diapers.
3735	Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy.
3735	Just came to me in the kitchen.
3735	I have a 50/50 chance of being right!
3735	When I was in Austin I used an "above the water" pedal kayak.
3735	Talk about easy.
3735	Neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best.
3735	The above the water is more stable than I expected.
3735	I had assumed that it would be tippy, but it really wasn't.
3735	Hope you have high water and not hell next weekend.
3736	need defn of above
3737	Sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties.
3737	I've sent a draft to their counsel all ready (D Hunt and Hemleben).
3738	Rogelio, Congratulations.
3738	That is quite an honor.
3738	Regards, Kay Mann
3739	I need a Heather deal to work on.
3739	Good luck in Conn!
3739	Kay
3740	I have a note on my calendar that Michael has an appt with SS today.
3740	Has it been cancelled?
3741	I'm available any time Friday, and tomorrow afternoon is fine, especially after 230.
3741	Kay
3742	Well, that's something I hadn't heard before.
3742	They should let that be known, don't you think?
3742	At least now WE know it!
3742	Kay
3743	Please email me a brief overview of what these documents are, how they fit into the overall picture, and the issues which need the most scrutiny.
3743	Additionally, have these been evaluated in light of Enron's balance sheet and financing issues?
3743	Thanks, Kay
3744	This place is more difficult than it needs to be.
3745	I don't know if David Hunt will have comments.
3745	In any event, Marvin, Bob and the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.
3745	Reagan has my current requests.
3745	Kay
3746	I'm thinking my last email was unclear.
3746	I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their review.
3746	I assume that the commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two lawyers I know about.
3746	Kay
3747	Figured you did, but better to be safe than sorry!
3748	Could you email me the list of issues you have encountered thus far.
3748	Ben really wants me to check with you.
3748	(I'm so proud!!) Kay
3749	Both of these are capitalized terms in rev 23.
3749	Is there a difference?
3749	Load Projection Model is in definitions, but Load Forecasting Model is used quite a bit.
3750	done
3751	Yes, however, I could use an electronic version if one is readily available (I have the PDF).
3751	Thanks, Kay
3752	Anytime which works for you is fine, as this is more important than my other meeting.
3753	Chris, The docs you sent me that I asked about are titled: Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Midway Grove, and Articles of Incorporation of Midway Grove Property Owners Association, Inc. I'm a bit unclear as to how the attached relate to those docs, but I must confess to having not read all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email.
3753	It would help if you could connect the dots for me.
3753	Thanks, Kay
3754	for calendar, especially 930
3755	How's Glenn doing with my binder?
3755	Lots of Midway activity this week.
3755	Thanks, Kay
3756	Quien es mas macho?
3757	Hi Doug, I hear you are working on the Midway deal.
3757	Me, too.
3757	I want to go back to the restaurant you suggested with the remarkable decor and wine list (was it Burns, something like that?).
3757	I look forward to working with you on this one.
3757	Kay
3758	Wanna come up?
3759	200 is late enough for anyone to be out.
3759	I'm all for the limo taking people home at that time.
3759	I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.
3759	Are you taking Friday off?
3759	Kay
3760	If it were me I'd go for the standard limo, mostly because I've never seen the other kind.
3761	I'm desperate.
3761	HELP!!!!!!
3761	We have a meeting with Duran et al today, and I really wanted to brouse through this before then.
3762	(20) If and when a new RTO begins operation, seek to provide Scheduling Services [term used correctly?] and to satisfy required RTO rules and protocols in accordance with RTO requirements.
3763	Did he say what happened?
3763	I thought he wasn't taking her until next week.
3764	Please print 4 execution copies of this from my o drive Please date the letter today.
3764	Thanks,
3765	Attached is a brief letter which has been approved by Herman, and which isnow presented for your review and approval.
3765	Greg Krause is the commerciallead, currently in Florida.
3765	His cell phone number is 713 857 0369.
3765	Kay Mr. Alberto Gonzalez Transmission Business Manager 4200 West Flagler Street Miami, Florida 33134 Re: Letter of Agreement Regarding Interconnection Development Services forthe Midway Development Company, L.L.C.
3765	Dear Mr. Gonzalez: Consistent with the results of the Feasibility and Facilities Studies anddiscussions that have been held to date between Florida Power & Light Compa(&FPL8) and Midway Development Company, L.L.C and its designees referred to as &MDC8, by this letter MDC authorizes FPL to perform the necessary studies, analysis and other activities required to develop and support a schedule thnecessary for a potential power project to interconnect with FPL,s transmission grid system and receive back-feed by March 15, 2002.
3765	MDC authorizes FPL to utilize the one hundred twenty-two thousand dollars($122,000.00) currently on deposit with FPL for Feasibility and Facility Studies to cover the cost of this work The scope of this work will be determined by MDC and FPL based on ongoingdiscussions and may be altered or modified by mutual consent from time totime.
3765	FPL will inform MDC periodically of their progress and if additional fundsare required to finance this work.
3765	Please acknowledge concurrence to the above between FPL and MDC by executinduplicate originals of this Letter of Agreement prior to returning to FPL for final execution.
3765	Sincerely, Ben Jacoby Director Enron North America AGREED AND ACCEPTED: Florida Power & Light Company Vice President, Transmission Operations & Planning
3766	I'm not doing a good job of time management, so yoga is looking doubtful.
3767	I would like a copy of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Site Plan Approvals, please.
3767	Thanks, Kay
3768	Here are my initial comments: There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process.
3768	For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping).
3768	It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we file for a building permit.
3768	I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.
3768	Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.
3768	Looks like a free call for the next 30 years.
3768	Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.
3768	Other than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing.
3768	Kay
3769	How do I get on the list for the form?
3769	Could you pretty please check for me?
3769	Thanks, Kay
3770	This place amazes me!
3770	Thanks for your help.
3770	I have no patience for it.
3770	We went to Michael's school conference today.
3770	His teacher raved about how everyone just loves Michael.
3770	He is so sweet.
3770	He is staying with my folks this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.
3770	I can't wait for him to come home.
3770	Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.
3770	I've got to take Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.
3770	Plus, I spent last weekend with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.
3770	I hope to PURGE the house of all the junk I have.
3770	I hope it is raining, because that is great cleaning weather.
3770	I want to see bare space in my closet.
3770	I think I'll call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.
3770	I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.
3770	Next Thursday is Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.
3770	Do you know anywhere that can enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?
3770	I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.
3770	Go figure.
3770	I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.
3770	I'll want to fed ex, just in case you are sending anyone else's today.
3770	Thanks, Kay
3771	Yes, because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking.
3772	So where are you kayaking this weekend?
3773	I would mention Carlos in the email, or have it shown as sent by him.
3773	If it were me (and not him), I would have you send it under your own name, but explain that you are helping Carlos.
3774	Thanks, but I'm throwing away junk all weekend.
3774	Neil will be gone....
3775	Maybe it is on the development phone list.
3775	I don't have it at hand.
3776	I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know what else.
3776	All have "baby Carnahan" on it.
3776	Will she give the baby her last name?
3776	That would be cool.
3776	I met someone (a guy) named Kayne.
3776	Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I thought it sounded cool.
3776	Kayne Carnahan.
3776	Opps, sounds like a bull rider!
3777	I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really help move the document along.
3777	I'll ask again if i can get it from him.
3777	There are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated.
3777	I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive commercial direction.
3777	Do you feel that the commercial team is finished with the exhibits?
3777	I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.
3777	I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough.
3777	Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff?
3777	Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.
3777	When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?
3777	Anyway to combine the two at once, given the short timeframe?
3777	Has Dave signed the extension, by the way?
3777	Kay
3778	It should be signed and on its way.
3778	I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm trying to get a draft of the agreement out.
3778	Do you think you will have a chance to send me the preamble stuff?
3778	I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/ Thanks, Kay
3779	That reminds me.
3779	There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such things.
3779	I don't remember where it is - PR?
3779	I wonder who would know?
3780	How cool is that.
3781	I can't locate the electronic version of Costs that David prepared.
3781	Can you resend it to me?
3782	What about this?
3782	Is this the QSE defn?
3782	&Scheduling Entity8 means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.
3783	Thanks.
3784	That means it is recognized, not "contemplated to be recognized", then?
3784	Ithere such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just scheduon their behalf?
3785	Please fill in the blank: &First Contingency Transmission Outage8 means
3786	If there are any other resolutions, etc that they want, I would let them prepare them.
3786	Thanks a bunch, Kay
3787	You're killing me.
3787	We have no definition for first contingency must run.
3787	Isthis the same as First Contingency Emergency Dispatch?
3788	yes, thanks
3789	Yes, I'm officially in Elizabeth's group.
3789	I need to ask her for a flat screen monitor.
3790	I just like to make Margie work.
3790	So do you think they'll fire Dierker?
3790	I guess you heard Lima is heading to the bullpen.
3791	You know ES doesn't work Fridays, so that takes away one day of opportunity to approve them, plus she hasn't had an assistant.
3791	Maybe things will improve.
3791	She is very excited about her new assistant.
3792	Here's where I am.
3792	I haven't finished all of your changes.
3792	Please look for bold stuff, that's where I have questions.
3792	If no question is given, I'm looking for your confirmation.
3793	Good afternoon, I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review.
3793	There are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal.
3793	Please note that we are anticipating a Monday meeting.
3793	Therefore, we have sent this out without the usual internal review.
3793	We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.
3793	Talk to you soon, Kay
3794	Have I signed this yet?
3795	Hi Greg, I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option payment credited to the purchase price of the land.
3795	As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.
3795	Ben holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.
3795	Hope you get email!
3795	Kay
3796	Hello.
3796	The commercial team has asked that I forward this document to you for review.
3796	It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.
3796	We have attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any desired changes.
3796	Thank you, Kay PS Pardon the formatting.
3796	It will be cleaned up by those with the ability to do so.
3797	Hi there.
3797	Is the site plan approval a different document than the development order?
3797	Thanks, Kay
3798	Please calendar for me.
3799	I give up.
3799	How in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion?
3800	hey, you're on vacation.
3800	NO WORKING
3801	I think Ben's time frame is realistic.
3801	I assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent.
3801	In addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the E-Next/accounting issues.
3801	GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, which should help expedite matters.
3801	Kay
3802	Steve, Merchant Energy Ventures doesn't have auditable financials, but NorthWestern Corporation will give GE a corporate guaranty for MEV.
3802	Let me know if you run into difficulty verifying their financial status, as I'm sure we can get you something.
3802	In addition, Enron North America will have the responsibility to make the future payments to GE as these payment obligations exist as of the closing.
3802	Kay

3806	Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.
3806	Thanks, Kay
3807	I haven't heard anything from David or Scott.
3807	Have you heard anything from Marvin or Bob?
3807	Is there a meeting confirmed for Monday?
3807	I'm on another conference call re landfill.
3807	Yikes.
3807	Kay
3808	Elizabeth, I would like to have a flat screen monitor, if possible.
3808	Thank you, Kay
3809	Well, let's try someplace else.
3809	What can you think of in walking distance?
3809	It is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group.
3809	Kay
3810	attachment contains overview
3811	Ben, I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.
3811	Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business unit.
3811	Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt.
3811	(yes, I know we didn't do it with the turbine stuff) Kay
3812	You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?
3812	I'm not asking him to do anything on the LOI.
3812	I haven't spoken to him in person.
3812	I'll address it when we connect.
3812	Are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me?
3812	Kay
3813	I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.
3813	I can have their power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it.
3814	FYI.
3814	Please read.
3815	I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John can clear conflicts.
3816	I can't open the form, but I'm good for $50.
3816	Is this something Enron can match?
3817	Enron is trying to buy some GE turbines to use in projects.
3818	FYI and Ken's review (no offense, John).
3819	Good luck!
3820	Hi Billy, Can you take a look at this since the Hermanator is out?
3820	Thanks, Kay
3821	As requested, here is the current draft of the Midway LOI.
3821	The counter party has not seen this draft yet, so this is still preliminary.
3821	I'm reviewing the term sheet re toll.
3821	Kay
3822	David, Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?
3822	I haven't heard the final word.
3822	Kay
3823	Kathleen, John Keffer, Bill Parrish and Andy Schifrin need access to Midway on Deal Bench.
3823	Can you handle this for me?
3823	Thanks, Kay
3824	I'll work on them over the weekend.
3825	if you insist...
3826	Very out of date, but indicative of the current structure.
3826	Stay tuned.
3827	Hmm.
3827	Not typical.
3827	Reorg?
3828	I hear Oz will be there, too.
3828	How fun!
3829	another puzzle piece
3830	much grass
3831	I vote for you.
3832	Any first class upgrades available?
3833	I'll be there, too.
3834	Attached are draft of more of the exhibits for discussion purposes.
3834	See you tomorrow, Kay
3835	I believe I land in Memphis around 930 Central.
3835	I'll try to call in if mycell works.
3835	Kay
3836	I can't find any call in info for the conference call on Monday.
3836	I may be reachable on 713 304 8716, or maybe someone could leave me a voice mail message at the office if there is a dial in number.
3836	Thanks,
3837	Took about 8 months.
3837	A new record.
3838	I was in Clarksdale yesterday, and have a dr's appt this am, but will be glad to give you what I have.
3838	In fact, I could use some help with the EEI if the offer is still good.
3838	Maybe you could just talk me through it.
3838	Thanks, Kay
3839	Wilson, We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could really use your help.
3839	I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
3839	Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?
3839	I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.
3839	Thank you, Kay
3840	Just a reminder that I have a drs appt this am.
3840	Nothing special, just one very overdue check up.
3840	Kay
3841	Very good.
3841	I was in Miss yesterday and have a doctor's appt this am.
3841	I'll call later.
3841	Kay
3842	I go back for more tests this afternoon.
3843	Thanks for the info.
3843	Rest well.
3844	Is this for the escrow or other docs?
3844	I know Citibank does not require a corporate seal.
3844	What BS!
3844	Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.
3844	Kay
3845	Gold Rose today?
3846	Nope.
3846	Only the new ones.
3847	I can't make the call on Thursday.
3847	I'm not sure that Sheila can either.
3847	I'll leave the go/no go Enron vote to Sheila.
3847	Kay
3848	Next time you vote for me, please copy me on the email.
3848	Kay
3849	I haven't read this yet, so it is not ready to be sent to TECO.
3849	Just wanted to give you a look as soon as possible.
3849	Kay
3850	Sometimes John forgets that he is not a lawyer.
3851	I'm available for one hour, so long as I can call in from off campus.
3851	I'll need a new cell phone battery first!
3851	My old one finally died a tragic death.
3851	Kay
3852	Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals.
3852	Kathleen would know.
3853	For something that doesn't matter, it seems to matter.
3853	I wonder how well the auto approval works when you are backdating something?
3854	How much involvement has A & K had on Midway?
3854	I have other counsel engaged for the sale, but this falls into a different category.
3854	Kay
3855	Ben, If Christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement, I ususally don't have outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason.
3855	She's the queen of interconnects.
3855	I suppose that after I review it, next stop is Finance/Accounting.
3855	Carlos has given me a couple of comments.
3855	Kay
3856	Please advise which comments you are willing to accept (skipping the nits and legal stuff).
3856	One response from the group, please!
3856	Kay
3857	It is Father's Day and we will do what you want.
3857	If you want to go there, that's great.
3857	I'm happy to tell Tom, his wife and all the world that what we do that weekend is 100% up to you.
3857	It sounds like he has the impression that I'm the hold up.
3857	Kay
3858	Got it
3859	Wilson, We are running short on time.
3859	We are planning to sign on Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date.
3859	Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?
3859	I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.
3859	Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same under this agreement?
3859	Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?
3859	Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.
3859	Kay
3860	Yes,which is what prompted my email this am.
3860	I'm looking for a way to simplify the process since closing is less than a week away.
3860	I'm in 825-925; 1000-1230 today.
3860	Kay
3861	Please print two copies.
3861	On the stuff you had copied for me, please have the copy sent to John Keffer at King & Spalding.
3861	I'll keep the originals.
3861	Thanks, Kay
3862	I should have sent this to you.
3862	Sorry.
3862	Might save time if you got financials from Mike re: NorthWestern Corp. Kay
3863	Amazing that they stayed afloat.
3863	50 year history probably helped that happen.
3863	Kinda sad, though.
3863	I liked those guys.
3864	I received a fax in yesterday, so I'll review it.
3864	Kay
3865	Billy, It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since construction will be nearly complete.
3865	Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it could be immediately prior to that time.
3865	Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed this agreement before she left.
3865	Kay
3866	yes Cant miss those boxes!
3867	Awaiting test results.
3867	You know how that goes.
3867	I give you details later.
3867	I may go; I'll let you know.
3868	Figures.
3869	No, he thinks he is God's gift to contracts.
3870	Neil, I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets nothing at school.
3870	She has no independent information on the rest and shouldn't worry about providing that info to them.
3871	Sounds like it, but it is in southern Florida.
3872	I didn't think you were being difficult.
3873	fyi.
3873	One of AE's.
3874	GE wants a letter outlining the structure of the deal (at the 10000 ft level), who owns which companies, and who has payment obligations to them.
3874	Could you draft a letter to that effect for my review?
3874	Thanks, Kay
3875	Attached is the master gas agreement, ready for Clarksdale's review.
3875	We haven't had any feedback from Yazoo City.
3875	When can we expect their feedback?
3875	Thanks, Kay
3876	6 months goes by quickly.
3877	How polite.
3878	Life being what it is, I've received a mark up of the tolling term sheet, which crossed in the mail with the mark up you sent.
3878	Kay
3879	Looks fine to me.
3879	Will you accept the changes and send out?
3879	I would like to receive a bcc of whatever goes out, if possible.
3879	Thanks, Kay
3880	Lloyd is a good guy.
3880	He is head of the Services Group.
3880	He probably does other things as well, but that's how I know him.
3880	I can send it to Lloyd if you want.
3880	Kay
3881	TECO tolling, with my comments:
3882	Could I get a copy of the revised LOI which was sent to TECO?
3882	I want to update my electronic file.
3882	Thanks, Kay
3883	Greg and Ben, So is it about time to get Lisa, Herman and Rose involved in the PAD stuff?
3883	Kay
3884	Never stayed there.
3884	My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may favorite locations.
3884	It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc. Last year I also stayed at the Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).
3884	I stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.
3884	I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I might remember the names.
3884	Kay
3885	Don't know how I missed this.
3885	Must have put it in my Midway file without looking.
3885	Thanks, Kay
3886	I've answered all their questions, and have suggested to Chris that he ask NorthWestern for audited financials.
3886	Marissa is preparing a letter which briefly outlines the deal, since GE had requested a letter identifying the parties, the payment obligations, etc. I've given them all this information previously in phone calls and by email, but I think they want something official looking.
3886	Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter.
3886	I don't think they will trade payment for a consent, but I could be wrong.
3886	It just isn't enough money, and GE isn't strapped for cash anyway.
3886	I'd want to be careful that we don't trip up on E - Next obligations.
3886	Kay
3887	When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor.
3887	What did you hear?
3888	Don't know if I'll participate, but please put on calendar anyway.
3889	Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the Cities?
3889	Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.
3889	Kay
3890	I'm working through the "agent for" issue, and thought I would share the info.
3890	I've asked our local counsel for a bit more direct answer (ie, his opinion).
3890	Kay
3891	As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet impact.
3892	Why would you ask a question out of the blue?
3893	Harlan Murphy started last week.
3893	Nice guy from Dynegy.
3894	Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.
3894	Incurring any other type of hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the balance sheet.
3894	Kay
3895	I think asking David the question is a good idea.
3895	Kay
3896	Correct.
3896	If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the timing restriction.
3896	You lose one layer of optionality.
3897	I'm no oracle, but there would be no current balance sheet impact.
3898	David, Is it possible for MDEA to purchase power from EPMI as an agent for the Cities?
3898	This will obviate the need for any type of security.
3898	Thanks, Kay
3899	Whatcha think?
3900	Hi Gerry, I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.
3900	I remember seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if payment isn't due yet.
3900	I always thought that was strange, and sure created clutter.
3900	I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.
3900	Does Dewey remember?
3900	If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave many folks who would have done so.
3900	I guess they could have changed the laws, though.
3900	Sorry I'm not more help.
3900	I've forgotten more than I've remembered.
3900	If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday at Keneally's, staring around 7.
3900	I'll buy.
3900	I can't believe she is 21.
3900	Very disruptive of my self-perception.
3900	Ciao, Kay
3901	please calendar.
3902	I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of where my computer would be if I was there.
3902	It is a lawyers name (which of course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.
3902	It may be David something or other.
3902	Could you email me that name and number?
3902	Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?
3902	Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.
3902	Kay
3903	There's nothing special here.
3903	Just cloudy.
3903	I took Roscoe in to get neutered.
3903	Neil just couldn't handle it.
3903	Men are so funny like that.
3903	Now I'm going to run some errands.
3903	I hope the weather gets better for this evening.
3903	They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, and it looks like it is getting better.
3903	Still more of a deal south of here.
3903	Kay
3904	Since I'm "off" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND without you, I'm not in much better shape.
3904	You know I've kept all my files on email.
3904	I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of something.
3904	Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing - highly inefficient.
3904	I can't do it here, though.
3904	Kay
3905	Shepherd, near San Felipe.
3905	Very close to Peggy's house.
3905	Peggy should be there, also.
3906	Good news.
3907	Huh?
3908	Being revised currently, but lays out the deal:
3909	Sorry to ask, but when do you expect to have a draft of the GE letter?
3909	I need to manage Ben's expectations.
3909	Thanks, Kay
3910	Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email?
3910	I'm on endless conference calls and need to contact him about a matter.
3910	Thanks, Kay PS, not a vacation day
3911	Keneally's, We'll be there by 630.
3912	It is Paige's 21st today (YIKES) I'll be back Monday
3913	No news today.
3913	I don't want to know today, as I'm drinking champagne and ignoring the issue,
3914	6.

3915	Works for me.
3915	We are leaving to check in to the hotel, then back.
3915	I had to cancel manicure/pedicure ( and charged for it) A hint that a gift certificate for same would work might be appropriate.
3916	Plse have fax delivered home.
3916	Today is the day.
3916	I have been a mom for 21 years.
3916	Can't be true.
3916	Still on conference call.
3916	Ben has been very nice.
3917	At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs.

3922	There is a good chance that they will operate tomorrow or the next day.
3922	If they do, then I will need to go to Ft.
3922	Worth for a couple of days.
3922	I'll keep you posted.
3922	Kay
3923	Have we given them anything in writing yet, and are you willing to mark everything?
3923	Kay
3924	We can add a statement that written information provided at the meeting of x date (or however you want to describe it) is covered, and that in the future written stuff will be designated as confidential.

3925	Test
3926	Thanks.

3927	Thanks, Suz.
3927	As you know, this stinks.
3927	Friends help.
3928	Thank you for your call.
3928	I'm very sad, a bit angry with the doctors, and tired.
3928	Your voice cheered me up.
3928	Love, Kay
3929	Hi Alice.
3929	I don't know that I will be back Monday.
3929	I need to help my mom get organized on some things.
3930	Thank you.
3930	Kay
3931	We are all doing reasonably well, I think.
3932	Can you handle?
3932	Thanks.
3933	Thank you, dear.
3934	Please forward to Andy Edison and Stuart Zisman.
3934	Thanks
3935	I can't open attachments - can you cut and paste?
3935	This will be hard.
3935	Don't forget to pray.
3935	And be patient as there is no timeline.
3935	Love, Mom
3936	As you know, it isn't easy.
3936	I think we are dong ok.
3936	Thanks for checking,
3937	Hi Alice.
3937	I have a favor to ask.
3937	Please see if you can find an 800 number for Lincoln Life Central for filing a life insurance claim.
3937	Thanks.
3937	Kay
3938	I just sent Alice an emai asking for help finding a number for Dads life insurance co.
3938	If she isn't in for some reason, all ask for your help.
3938	Thanks for the plant.
3938	That was so sweet.
3938	Kay
3939	How about a call today at 2?
3940	Hi.
3940	I'm planning to drive back today, and will take tomorrow off.
3940	I!ll need to come back soon, but I think it is time for me to go.
3940	Thanks for all your support.
3940	It has made a big difference.
3940	Kay
3941	I will have to check to see who handles the paralegal hiring.
3941	What is up with ENE?
3941	I!m still in FW.
3941	Kay
3942	Ok.
3942	I have 30 minutes then.
3943	Marisa sent the invoices.
3944	Today has been hard for me.
3944	I don't have the distraction of taking care of Mimi.
3944	I am going to gob to work tomorrow, but I dread it.
3944	You are welcome in Palacios this weekend, of course.
3944	Love, Mom
3945	I have Lotus Notes emails which I can't forward since we've migrated to Outlook.
3945	Kay
3946	Hi Eric, I'm back in the office, and am working on this deal again.
3946	Seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously.
3946	Specifically, we need copies of the following documents: Lease agreement between CES and UST.
3946	Nortel RTU terms.
3946	Bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from TCP to CES.
3946	I can speak with US Telenet's attorney regarding these requests, if you can get his/her name and number or email address.
3946	I know there are some other issues, but getting these documents will really help.
3946	Thanks, Kay
3947	If I'm remembering correctly, it could be Connecticut.
3947	That narrows it down quite a bit.
3948	Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.
3948	The numbers don't seem to match, but we won't worry about that now.
3948	The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday.
3948	Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.
3948	To the extent necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial questions.
3948	We won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet.
3948	Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).
3948	Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.
3948	If the docs aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any additional expense.
3948	I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear.
3948	Thanks, Kay
3949	I signed up for the Nov 15/16 Risk Management Seminar, and I wanted to confirm my registration.
3949	Thanks, Kay
3950	Let's wait until Monday.
3951	I was trying to remember what Bobby said.
3951	Can you remember!
3952	Tied St Jerome 1 to 1.
3952	They played dirty, Michael hung tough.
3952	He played goalie almost the entire game.
3952	Rosco was great.
3952	We are on the road to Palacios.
3952	Love, Mom
3953	I received word that the switch deal is off.
3953	Thanks anyway.
3954	Just got this.
3954	I know several who work there.
3954	John Keffer is the one I know best.
3954	We went to Palacios to fish.
3954	It was very nice.
3954	Wonder what next week will bring.
3955	I would not say that we are "near junk status" on our credit rating.
3956	I called her office and they told me.
3956	What time Friday?
3956	What's his name?
3956	Do you have a handle on what she was working on?
3956	I wouldn't want to bother her about anything.
3956	Kay
3957	I'm sure she had things put together well.
3958	Thanks, Kay
3959	It appeared to me that a GSA would be most appropriate for this work.
3959	In speaking with some other EBS lawyers, I was told that Adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the GSA.
3959	Please let me know if this is incorrect.
3959	Kay
3960	Will you incorporate the provisions of the document that Brenda forwarded?
3960	Kay
3961	Feel free to ignore.
3961	I'm talking to Adriana now.
3962	I'm happy to look at another format.
3962	This was the one Michelle gave me.
3962	Kay
3963	I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation.
3963	Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.
3963	A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.
3963	Do we have anything else to go on?
3963	(I don't think the Margate issue is enough, either.) I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January anyway.
3963	Kay
3964	The document below contains the guts of the tasking letter, I believe.
3964	The GSA was in the other email.
3965	The GSA, without name and address.
3965	Could you forward me the tasking letter once you are done so that I can understand how the pieces fit together?
3965	Thanks, Kay
3966	ok with me.
3967	Thanks.
3968	Good to go.
3969	Haven't done anything with it since there hasn't been any activity.
3969	If we think that we want to do something, it would be helpful to get a copy of the master.
3969	I don't think I still have a copy.
3969	I can probably look it up on Spotlight, but if you have an electronic file handy I would be most grateful.
3969	Kay
3970	Kerri, Could you call me about these at your convenience?
3970	Thanks, Kay
3971	got it.
3971	Does Genuity know that we want some changes yet?
3972	For sure.
3973	Please print and make file folder "Genuity" for EBS.
3973	Thanks!
3973	Kay
3974	I'm big on the blackberry.
3975	I will be late on day one.
3976	I haven't heard anything on this.
3976	I'll wait to hear from Steve and Mike.
3976	Kay
3977	ok with me.
3978	Getting warmer.
3978	Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.
3979	Day ahead only?
3979	How do we work together to set the bogie?
3979	I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units.
3979	Is this a gas only facility?
3979	How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?
3979	Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?
3979	Thanks, Kay
3980	I think I get this everyday now.
3980	Can you help get this cleared up?
3980	Thanks.
3981	I think in this case specific is better.
3981	Also, please check with K Young to see what is in place.
3981	We don't want to look bad to Dyn.
3982	Hi there.
3982	We need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate, and how to deal with the 36 vs 42 issue on Deerfield.
3982	Shall we try again for a conference call later today?
3982	Karri is available up until 4:30pm, (Central).
3982	Thanks, Kay
3983	Obviously, we barely survived without you.
3983	Kay
3984	Can you have someone set it up, including KB and Ryan Reitz?
3984	Thanks, Kay
3985	I'm disappointed that GE didn't call.
3985	Must not have wanted to take the Enron credit risk.
3985	I think we will also need to report it to the merger legal team, which I will take care of once we know what is up.
3985	Kay
3986	I checked the docs.
3986	Closing is supposed to be 5 business days after notice, subject to regulatory approval.
3986	I believe they will need to make a Hart Scott Rodino filing.
3986	It should not take very long for to get it.
3986	Seems Delta got it in a matter of days.
3986	Kay
3987	Hi Carolyn, Could you resend the docs?
3987	Our computer system deleted everything more than 30 days old.
3987	Thanks, Kay
3988	I'm supposed to talk to Ben and Steve today.
3988	Will you and KB be around this afternoon?
3989	Sounds good.
3990	I gave the IP Transit deal a quick look, and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm, with the capacity and price varying, depending on the month.
3990	May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.
3990	Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.
3990	I suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it, amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule.
3990	What do you think?
3990	Kay
3991	I think fmv is probably less than fifty.
3991	Thanks.
3992	thanks
3993	It would be terrific if I could see the tasking letter before I give final approval to the GSA (since this is really a one-off deal), and I will need to approve and initial both the GSA and the tasking letter.
3993	Thanks, Kay
3994	should be here
3995	Kinda wish Kortney would have talked to me and cc'd me on this.
3995	Does this happen much?
3995	Don't know that I have a big problem with it, but it just seems like it isn't purely a Credit issue.
3995	What do you think?
3995	Kay
3996	And me?
3997	Ben, I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.
3997	Will you be in this week?
3997	If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.
3997	Kay Kathleen, Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.
3997	Thanks.
3998	I will have to find a form.
3998	If you think the deal will extend more than a couple of months, or could develop into something bigger, I really suggest an EEI.
3998	Once I find a form we can determine if we need a separate services agreement, or we can bake it into the GTC's/long confirm document.
3998	Kay
3999	We don't want to pay them until we get agreement to the form of the docs.
3999	I don't think much will be required, but I just want to make sure it is coordinated.
3999	Kay
4000	They've changed the Cogentrix deal.
4000	In fact, it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty.
4000	I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms.
4000	Can you help?
4000	Guess you would like the name of the counterparty.
4000	I'll send it to you.
4000	Thanks as always!
4000	Kay
4001	Thanks.
4002	The closing docs are on top of my cabinet, near my name plate.
4002	Help yourself.
4002	Thanks, Kay
4003	Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC
4004	Ruth, Could you print theirs and ours for me since I may not make it to my desk before I come over?
4004	Thanks.
4005	Kayne and Rahil, Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.
4005	For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.
4005	I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.
4005	I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.
4005	Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?
4005	If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?
4005	Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?
4005	If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.
4005	What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?
4005	What are Resource Costs?
4005	How often will we email or fax them a sales summary?
4005	Will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?
4005	Kortney, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.
4005	Thanks for your help, Kay
4006	Where are you?
4006	I'm on 6.
4007	Probably tomorrow.
4007	I got a feeling that Dave would like to visit with you about it.
4007	Dismal here.
4007	How are you?
4008	They are supposed to give no less than 5 business days notice prior to closing.
4008	The earliest notice I saw was Nov. 19.
4008	I counted the 20th, 21st, 23, 26, closing on the 27th.
4008	(page 12 of the amended and restated LLC agreement).
4008	Kay
4009	Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.
4009	Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.
4009	We were working off of different receipt dates.
4009	I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.
4009	That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.
4009	Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.
4009	I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.
4009	Thanks, Kay
4010	I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.
4010	I would think that this shouldn't take very long.
4011	Please print email and attachments.
4011	Thanks!
4012	John, There is a $739 charge from CT Corp. on invoice #186444 (re Blue Dog).
4012	Can you send me an email with a brief explanation?
4012	I want to get this in the queue.
4012	Ciao, Kay
4013	In hindsight we should have had them pay it.
4013	Oh well.
4013	Got your fax and will check in to others.
4014	Does that look right?
4014	Lorie says it is a WBS code number (Greek to me).
4015	Gentlemen, Pursuant to my discussion with Mr. Swift, I am enclosing a draft letter for your review.
4015	Kay
4016	Hi Jerry, Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.
4016	I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.
4016	Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
4016	Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.
4016	My fax number is 713 646 3491.
4016	I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.
4016	Quite frankly I just overlooked it.
4016	Kay
4017	The form was fine.
4017	Kay
4018	The power is executed, I just need to get the cert signed.
4018	Have a good evening.
4019	Hi Ben, It would be great if you could expedite the invoices.
4019	Thanks, Kay
4020	I was having trouble with the system last time I tried a couple of hours ago.
4020	I'll try again later.
4021	Will do, and thanks.
4021	Kay
4022	No need to hold off.
4022	I'm not worried about GE.
4022	I need Dave to sign one more document.
4022	Is he around?
4022	How do you like your new digs?
4022	Kay
4023	Dynegy is getting a very nice building.
4023	See you in a bit.
4024	Hi Kathleen, Would you mind printing this letter on letterhead for Ben to sign?
4024	I'll be over in just a bit.
4024	Thanks, Kay
4025	Looks good to me.
4026	Jeff, What's your suggestion?
4026	We are looking at a PA in connection with Tennessee Pipeline's open season.
4026	(did I get that right?)
4027	I'll ask Jeff what he thinks.
4028	I only have 4 in my box, and none were the ones I gave you.
4028	Thanks!
4029	have you faxed the docs yet?
4030	Last time I checked I was told that the wire was in the queue.
4030	Kay
4031	I'm talking about the member interest power in particular.
4031	We don't have to have to send them the Darst stuff today.
4031	I have another piece of paper that Dave needs to sign as well.
4032	Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate.
4032	By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that.
4033	Closing list: 1.
4033	Power (executed by DD) 2.
4033	Certificate (as is) 3.
4033	Darst letter (waiting for GE to sign, copy to be sent to NW later) 4.
4033	Letter regarding setoff (need to have WDD sign) 1 and 2 should go to NorthWestern today by fax and fed ex.
4033	3 and 4 can go tomorrow.
4033	Need to notify corp sec also?
4033	Thanks!!!
4034	I have made spa appointments at Urban Retreat West for Friday afternoon, beginning at 330.
4035	In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info: 1.
4035	Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.
4035	2.
4035	A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.
4035	I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.
4035	Kay
4036	And that's what it's all about...
4037	Good.
4037	Gives us something productive to do!
4038	We are considering submitting a bid to provide standard offer service to commercial and industrial end users.
4038	Can you tell me if EPMI is licensed to provide retail service in Maine?
4038	If you aren't the right person, who should I ask?
4038	Thanks bunches, Kay
4039	I can't figure out how to change it.
4039	You can just log on as me: Password: enron001 thanks!
4040	I'm too lazy to send to everyone, so please pass it along.
4041	this is good stuff Note: forwarded message attached.
4041	Do You Yahoo!?
4041	Yahoo!
4041	GeoCities - quick and easy web site hosting, just $8.95/month.
4042	Have a blackberry and cell phone.
4043	Me, too.
4043	My little boy watches it all the time.
4043	Maybe we can watch it together!
4044	Thanks, Pete.
4044	It is a mess for sure.
4044	Kay
4045	I think it may be true, but not correct.
4045	Or is it correct, but not true?
4045	Yes, I'm bored.
4046	My pleasure.
4047	Thanks.
4048	Could you send me the format you are using for your resume?
4048	Kay
4049	thanks
4050	My 1984 format is a bit out-of-date.
4051	So how come no one will buy for $5b?
4052	I just couldn't help myself.
4053	I see they've halted the sending of replies.
4053	I will see if you should prepare them anyway to send tomorrow.
4053	Here's the list of what we have so far.
4053	I'll give you the letters and Debra is in charge of the files.
4053	It may be we don't have to look at every contract to get this done.
4053	Kay
4054	We should also have forms they previously approved, since we have negotiated a couple of CA's with them in the past.
4055	R u going to call?
4056	you might check with the bank.
4056	My paycheck should have hit by now.
4057	New program.
4057	The only termination notices we are responding to are those with termination payment calculations.
4057	Some of the letters were something other than termination/suspension notices, so you might want to check to see if you think we need to reply for other reasons.
4057	Kay
4058	Good op ed piece.
4059	There will be no holds barred with the Times and the Wash Post weigh in on this one.
4060	Yes
4061	Yes.
4062	Unbelieveable.
4062	Call me tonight 7139736325
4063	Could you send me the notice of default and our response?
4063	Thanks!
4064	I'll be there with bells on and cards in hand.
4064	Ciao, Kay
4065	Is Enron in default under the Sandhill agreements?
4065	How about any other deals you know about, including the Mexico stuff?
4065	Have you inherited Peoples (enovate) yet?
4065	I suspect there may be a default there.
4065	I'm helping gather some of this info, and your help would be appreciated.
4066	Thought I would ask a more specific question.
4066	Do you know of any transactions which Enron may be in default due to recent circumstances?
4066	I'm excluding trading deals.
4066	Maybe some of the asset management deals?
4066	Joint venture companies (enovate?)?
4066	Thanks, Kay
4067	too good
4068	I think I still need the data sheet for this corp.
4068	Thanks
4069	can you help me?
4070	Travis, The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.
4070	Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.
4070	Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.
4070	We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).
4070	We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.
4070	Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.
4070	I'm still here.
4070	Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.
4070	Kay
4071	Hi Robin, Can you locate the EBS Inc bylaws for me?
4071	I wasn't able to get on Spotlight this am.
4071	Thanks, Kay
4072	no word yet.
4073	Would you mind calling Diagnostic Clinic and canceling my appt with dr roman tomorrow?
4073	I think work may be a bit complicated.
4073	(I'm on the phone) Thanks!!!!
4074	Will work for food.
4075	Janet, Do you know if we have any deals in Texas or Penn which might be impacted by a license suspension?
4075	I know that's a tough question.
4075	Kay
4076	Will you modify the opinions you have to include this language?
4076	Thanks, Kay
4077	Works for me.
4078	I am going to email you the changes I have in the subsidiary form.
4078	There are some nits included which should be fixed in JD's.
4078	Kay
4079	The Portland General Security and Pledge Agreement is not a "Loan Document'.
4080	Well I hope he puts in a good word for me.
4080	I talked to Carlos, and he didn't say anything about the call you referenced.
4080	Are you sure your leg wasn't being pulled?
4081	Interesting stuff
4082	thanks.
4082	Do you need anything else from me at this time?
4082	Kay
4083	Could you send me whatever you think is appropriate so I can get it in front of the lenders?
4083	Thanks, Kay
4084	Elizabeth has scheduled a meeting at 4 o'clock concerning non-terminated trading contracts.
4084	It will be in the conference room with all the contracts (don't remember the room number).
4084	You are cordially invited (requested) to attend.
4084	Kay
4085	I'm gone
4086	Michael has his holiday performance.
4086	Thanks for asking.
4087	Hi Peter, Still here.
4087	Let me give you my home email, just in case: Kay.mann@worldnet.att.net.
4087	My main objective currently is to maintain a positive attitude.
4087	Hope you and yours enjoy the holidays.
4087	Kay
4088	Very cute.
4088	All the kids were cute.
4089	fine with me
4090	yes, John is picking us up in 3 minutes downstairs.
4091	Still not resolved.
4092	At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?
4092	I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.
4092	If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.
4092	More to consider!
4093	Are you still having yours?
4094	understood.
4094	I think Kayne needs some help in working through MDEA.
4094	Kay
4095	They are talking termination, which may not be justified for the asset management deal.
4095	Don't know whether that would be a good thing or not.
4096	I would like to cancel.
4096	Thanks, Kay Mann
4097	I'm in a meeting but will check when I get back to my office.
4098	The only change would be the date.
4099	I am familiar with the Mancini option, but I don't know who this person might be.
4099	Any ideas?
4100	I may have sent this to you before.
4101	Do you have the Haywood file that was in Carlos' office?
4101	I need it or a copy of it.
4101	Thanks, Kay
4102	Ben has given this to Raimund to deal with.
4103	I think it would be a good idea to have the files copied.
4103	Kay
4104	How late will you be here today?
4105	Are the right one to ask for this?
4105	Thanks, Kay
4106	Hi there, I've been told that the waiver needs to contain a statement that GT won't bring suit against any of the officers, directors or employees of Enron.
4106	If you can make that change and fax me a new waiver, we will get it done as quickly as possible.
4106	Thanks, Kay
4107	Could you mark up the llc opinion and fax it to Suzanne Adams at 7136463491?
4107	Thanks.
4108	You should be getting a fax from Maurice re ees llc opinion.
4108	Please send me an email describing the changes he is requesting.
4108	Thanks.
4109	Please call Debbie and ask her to fax you a copy of the executed guaranty.
4110	Please let me know if you learn anything at the floor meeting.
4110	Kay
4111	I am almost speechless.
4111	I knew things were bad based on what you said.
4111	Incredible.
4112	This is all so unreal.
4113	He can't help himself.
4114	We are all fragile.
4115	Good to know it exists.
4115	Just kidding.
4116	Could you email me the new sentence on page 2?
4116	Were those the only 2 changes?
4117	Oik to make changes, change out original.
4117	What did Mark say?
4118	You don't need to get it signed, just substitute the new pages.
4118	Yes I like perfume.
4119	Good for you.
4119	Not like you'll get paid for it.

4132	I'm at the doctors office and won't be back that soon.
4132	I'm about done with my contracts.
4133	Got here early.
4133	Fannin is a mess by the Dome and elsewhere.

4137	Mrs. Cornelius Dudley Neil Mann (Kay)
4138	Just so you know, I'm still in the waiting room.

4140	If there isn't one here, please call Ron Tapscott and see if he can get us a room in the new building.
4140	Thanks.
4140	Kay
4141	I would like to take Dec 26, 31 and Jan. 2 as vacation days.
4141	Thanks, Kay
4142	Thanks.
4143	I stopped by to ask Richard or Lisa, and neither were there.
4143	Since Debbie said we could pick, I picked the one with the smallest retainer and the lower amount.
4143	If I hear something I will let you know.
4144	It would be helpful to see the lease and the letter before commenting.
4144	Thanks, Kay
4145	Probably until 6.
4146	The lease is freely assignable.
4146	The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.
4146	I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do.
4146	I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue.
4146	However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly.
4146	In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible.
4146	Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?
4146	Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris.
4146	My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.
4146	Thanks, Kay
4147	That's fine.
4148	I found $206 coming to me!!!
4149	Stuart had a suggested change.
4149	I'll email it to you.
4150	I will tell them.
4150	Thanks.
4151	In a couple of weeks.
4152	Neil has been asking around.
4152	Can't get anyone at Enron to think that far ahead.
4152	I hate doing this, but I owe it to Michael, since I really want to keep him in private school.
4152	We've already eliminated his speech therapy.
4152	Geez, I sound pathetic.
4152	Kay

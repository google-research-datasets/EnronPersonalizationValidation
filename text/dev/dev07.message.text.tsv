1	I have not looked at this file yet.
1	Please pass it on to whomever you think might need it.
2	I have 2 storage questions for now.
2	1.
2	Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking facility.
2	The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.
2	Did you have a withdrawal schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?
2	2.
2	TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current storage balance is about 5 BCF.
2	What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??
2	thanks
3	FYI
4	I know you are going to make me a happy camper and let me know what you have executed for Jan 2000 so far!!

9	I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage (see items in BLUE below).
9	According to John, CES was not able to utilize the PEPL storage volumes.
9	Hunter, someone on your desk needs to speak with Marke Breese and John Hodge about the Dayton Storage.
10	Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!
10	Sorry - that was just running thru my head.
10	I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.
10	Transport I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.
10	For the 1st, all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.
10	The file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.
10	We have most of the retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U. Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset management deals.
10	Ex.
10	Tennessee MUNi's.
10	How many of these are there??
10	Good question.
10	Good Luck Have fun ;)
11	I think that's enough stuff for now.
12	I don't think I have sent this to you yet.
12	There are some ANR volumes down below.
13	Attached is the master list of contracts.
13	I save this file as have an abundance of time on your hands so feel free to browse this tiny little worksheet.
13	Call me if you have questions.
14	Deja Vu!
14	I'm waiting for those Final Final Revised Final numbers!!
15	This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM.
15	For most pipelines, It does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another counterparty.
15	Call if you have questions.
16	Setting these up in Sitara will be part of my night job.
16	I must have peace and quiet to focus on Transco.
17	How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was dedicated to retail?
17	From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small.
18	According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR.
18	Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.
18	You may already know about this deal.
18	Morgan handles all the nominations at East Ohio.
18	Hunter, someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal.
18	Thanks
19	FYI - I believe this is important.
19	According to Morgan (CES's CNG scheduler) CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity.
19	I've had 3 people call me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000.
20	Tuesday 12/28/99 9:00am Aspiration biopsy with specimen collection hematology.

21	Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.
21	Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.
21	The volume is currently 2187 dth per day.
21	Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.
21	Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?
21	They should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.
21	Thanks
22	I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara We have; several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES, we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S. Jersey - on CEM I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my priority list right now.
22	I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - this has not been done yet.
22	Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation.
22	ta da :)
23	Did you guys execute the PSNC contract??
23	And if so - as CES or CEM??
23	Also, I'd like to have the offer number.
23	I think Transco is done except for PSNC.
23	Transco Stuff I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES.
23	I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.
23	I think thats it.
24	What pipe is this off of or is it split up between several??
25	Sorry if this is a duplicate - I don't remember if I sent this to you.
26	Why don't you guys try Pappa's Steakhouse?
26	It's about $20 - $30 a plate.
27	Here
28	Please set up a meeting for this afternoon and invite the following people.
28	Bob Superty Kathy Kelly Ed Terry Tricia Bowen Judy Townsend Dan Junek Chris Germany Victor Lamadrid Molly Johnson Randy Gay George Smith Maria Garza Mark Friedman Ami Chokshi Scott Mills Dave Nommenson David Scott - with CES Hopefully this will be a quick meeting.

29	Let me know if I need to do something.
30	Colleen will be attending via conference call.
31	Please discuss this with Morgan.
31	I didn't know CGV had a delivery point off Transco.
32	Robert, please check on this with the TCO schedulers and let me know what you find out.
32	Thanks
33	I don't think there are any Central Desk changes.
34	I don't understand the PA gas for Peco comments.
34	Can you guys clear this up for me?
35	I'm thinking about seeing them tomorrow - lettin' em chill.
35	I'm going to try to make the Thursday 4:00PM appointment.
36	Hey team, I entered a sale of 10,659 in M3 for the 1st (deal 144104).
36	This does not include anything that has PECO-PA gas.
36	Morgan and/or Phil have to help me figure out what that is.
37	Dad is at Howard Johnson at 9604 S Main, room 403, phone 713-666-1411
38	The 2000ces01.xls is the file I created.
38	The other file was created by Jeff Hodge
39	How much of this capacity do we have for the first?
40	Victor verified that the TCO storage is at 0.
40	He entered a volume of 1DT and the deal number is 143337.
41	Final Final numbers??
42	CNG SAbine contact is Alain Diza 713-752-7690.
43	Done, I think.
44	Is the TCO capacity from Eagle Point considered Retail or Wholesale?
45	You are wonderful!!
46	Which pipe?
47	Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format?
47	We may not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).
47	What do you think?
48	Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.
48	1.
48	Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at NYMX + .35.
48	Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 2000.
48	CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.
48	2.
48	Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving Equitable $.65 for the exchange.
48	We call this a synthetic storage deal.
48	Do you know anything about these deals?
49	I'm sorry.
49	I forgot to mention Kathy and I can't find these deals in our system.
50	Pop's just called me.
50	He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying in the Hotel.
50	He is going home now, and will drive back tomorrow for the test results.
51	Beavy??
51	I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up.
51	I know I need to set up IT contracts in Sitara.
51	And I think the agencies with other counterparties is at the bottom of the pile.
51	Comments
52	I agree, you stay home.
52	He didn't have any info on the test.
52	He was ready to go.,
53	Done again.
54	Hows your day
55	I need a new pipeline set up.
55	CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.
55	All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.
55	Name: Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership Internet Address: Curve: Tetco M3 This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on CGAS.
55	We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st.
55	Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?
55	Please let me know what I need to do.
56	What type of IT contract is CES contract #.6187??
56	The contract description in Transit is Case-Pomeroy & Company, Inc. Hmmm?
57	CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.
57	CES is selling 2500 dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.
57	Looks like a match to me.
57	I told Fred with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.
57	For future reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.
57	A backup contact at Equitable is Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.
57	Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 12/1/99.
57	On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.
57	I don't see a sale anywhere to Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.
57	I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.
57	Comments?
58	I owe Victor $5.00.
58	I told him it would be 2 weeks before anything happened.
58	You're right Victor, they are wonderful people.
58	Victor, Robert or I will send through some meter request next week.
58	Thanks
59	Per Steve Gillespie - this is our operational flexibility with the Penn Fuel asset management deal for January.
59	Steve, I am assuming all of the numbers shown below are citygate numbers.
59	TCO - Penn Fuel baseoaded 5000 ENA has 2610 to use without recall no daily swing.
59	Tetco use 9448 have daily swing of 11,256 declined monthly swing of 3500 need to notiy day before flow usually by 10:00
60	Please set up the following transport deals; #145949 & 145950
61	Please reserve a conference room for the people listed above at 3:00 PM, tomorrow.
61	Mr. Javins will be present via conference call.
61	thanks
62	CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas Eastern.
62	CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.
62	According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete.
62	Here are my questions/comments; 1.
62	David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 146788).
62	The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.
62	I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.
62	If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal.
62	Please let me know ASAP.
62	2.
62	Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?
62	I would like to see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due.
62	3.
62	David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?
62	4.
62	Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals.
62	He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.
62	Who should he talk to about that??
62	Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.
62	Thanks
63	Just put 17 pages on the fax machine.

69	Why Exercise???
69	1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60.
69	She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is.
69	2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again.
69	3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks.
69	Haven't lost a pound.
69	Apparently you have to show up.
69	4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing.
69	5) I don't exercise at all.
69	If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body.
69	6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.
69	7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.
69	8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.
69	9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.
69	10) I don't jog.
69	It makes the ice jump right out of my glass.

71	It's 20,000 day with a primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH.
71	The term is 11/1/99 - 10/31/2000.
71	Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this belong to wholesale??
71	Also, I'm showing a demand charge of $.15.
72	Judy's name is not on the list either.
72	What's up with that?
73	Would you see if CES sent us a Sonat invoice for Dec or Nov?
73	I would like to see it.
73	Thanks cg
74	Have I seen the Explorer??
74	Nope.
74	I just get to work for a living.
74	I don't get to enjoy life's pleasures.
75	Is this the Eagle Point gas?
76	Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 11/1/99 - 4/30/01.
76	Is this considered retail or wholesale?
76	I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.
76	Is that correct?
77	I'm showing the CNG/Nimo FTNNGSS capacity of 15,957 DT's and the MARQ as Wholesale - correct?
78	I need to have a CES counterparty set up in global please.
78	Customer Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP) 12500 Fair Lakes Circle, Suite 200 I don't think CALP has assigned the contract to ENA.
78	I have a copy of the agreement if anyone needs to see it.
78	Thanks
79	I sold CES 1509/day starting the 14th - see deal 149770
80	I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES Retail fuel management deal.
80	ENA has the right to use the capacity and does all the nominations on the CALP contract.
80	I still need the counterpart set up.
80	Thanks Victor, for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 149776).
80	We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and unconstrained citygates.
80	Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.
80	For January, we will treat this as an exchange.
80	We need to chat about Feb and March.
81	I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.
81	Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.
81	As far as I can tell, ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.
81	So, we should show a purchase from CES for the storage gas.
81	Of course it will get much more complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues.

84	Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF +.01.
84	and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.
84	The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.
84	I just added the purchase deal on CGAS, it was not in Sitara.
84	Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover the ANR variable cost plus $.02.
85	We know about this don't we Judith!!!
86	This is in Sitara.
87	Email works good.
87	Do you know which deal I should put that on?
88	No replying this late at night.
88	Then I don't have an excuse for not doing my job.
89	I just created deal 149901, an Equitrans, capacity deal.
89	I populated all the fields because Sylvia Campos had created the information prior to my creating the deal.
89	After I released the deal, the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred.
90	The Equitrans capacity deals exist!!
91	I have very little info on this deal.
91	Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
91	Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
91	Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.
91	I believe Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.
91	Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.
91	It was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.
91	Please email everyone with the end date when you find out.
91	Also, please find out who the releasing shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.
91	Thanks
92	Done - take a look.
93	Thanks Buddy
94	Not yet.
94	However, the contract is valid because Vickie is using it.
95	I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.
95	There was some confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS.
96	Check out this website
97	Test
98	We bought gas from Keyspan at $5.00 intraday today.
98	We are shipping that IT to Emporia, Fuel is 1.52%.
98	I estimated $.07 for fuel and $.17 for commodity.
98	See deal 118105.
99	CNG Transport from NIMO Contract 5A1866 Demand Dec $5.7690 Jan $5.7500 Feb 5.7510 Commodity $.0456 (CNG does not bill the commodity part of GRI, also the commodity rate does not change during the term of the deal) Note This should be valued at generic North to North space.
99	CNG Volume 15957 Note: We have no value for this much MARQ.
99	We might be able to use about 3,000 dth of this.
99	I have a call in to Greg Synder at CNG.
99	Greg is in the rates group.
99	I believe it works like this; we pay max IT for gathering ( $.1980 for Jan), If you have MARQ, the rate drops to $.1440.
99	IT is a pain to nominate.
99	I will verify that this is the way it works with Greg.

106	I'm assuming you and Ms. Jordan are taking care of everthing on that.
106	Also, if you ever need to send transport contracts to Houston, its best to send it to Sylvia Campos.
106	She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper.
106	So send her allllll of your paper.
107	My good buddy Scott set up contract .9047 in Sitara.
107	Please note: do not schedule gas on this contract.
107	This contract was set up for accounting purposes only.
108	Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch.
108	Supply Deal Market Deal The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES.
108	Originally these deals were done for the 21st, I just extended the date and the volumes through the Let me know if you have any questions.
109	This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, please let me know if this is incorrect.
109	ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.
109	In return, Dayton is giving ENA gas at various CGAS citygates.
109	There are no fees for this transaction.
109	The TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.
109	The volumes on these deals should match.
109	Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.
109	Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.
109	Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.
110	Sorry it took so long.
110	I believe this was the last email I sent out.
111	Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails.
111	Here is what your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct.
112	I forgot about this deal.
113	Please check on the actual storage capacity volume on FSS contract 63304.
113	I'm showing 7,503,838 dth and I'm thinking it might be closer to 7,000,000.
113	Thanks
114	Hi guys.
114	We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.
114	The impact to the desk is ($694,399).
114	This includes the demand charge paid to CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.
114	It does not include any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.
114	How are we accounting for that?
114	The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls Use tab CES WHOLESALE.
114	All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.
114	I sure we are missing some things.
114	Scott Goodell will be going through this worksheet tomorrow.
115	I made a couple of changes.
115	This worksheet will be your top priority for Friday.
116	I'm at work, where are you??
117	Deal 150348.
117	I have it in Sitara as 833 day for the 15th-31st.
117	This deal is secondary recallable, which means the gas don't flow if secondary transport gets cut.
118	Do you mean an ENA sale to Keyspan?
119	We should chat about CALP and Dayton Power & Light.
119	Victor, should we invite Joany?
120	Kim, please send Victor and myself an amtel message at 11:00am AND at 1:30pm on Feb 1 to attend the meeting below.
120	Please include the room and time on the amtel.
120	I think it will be a busy day.
120	Thanks
121	I bet you think I have been ignoring you, right?
121	Does this mean I don't have to read all those emails you sent me?
122	What did we do about this?
122	I'm thinking we let it flow.
123	Would you send me an amtel at 3:00pm Wed, Jan 26 about my review?
123	Thanks
124	You must have put a lot of thought in this.
124	P
125	I think we chatted about this the other day.
125	I'm waiting to see if we actually get the retail deal before I send any notification.
125	Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb. I wouldn't tell Steve its not a done deal yet.
125	Just tell him we are still working things out.
126	Should this deal be extended?
127	This looks like IT stuff to me.
128	I was just denied access to deal 145893???
128	What's up?
129	We extended the date and changed this to evergreen.
129	Thanks

140	We bought 500 from COH (deal 155197) and sold it to CES (deal 155195) for the 26th.

141	We bought 1249 from CPA (deal 155240) and sold it to EES (deal 155244).

142	Go 1 block to Renton.
142	Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down.
143	I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger??

145	How about Monday, Jan 31st for dinner??
146	Hey!!
146	Where are you?
146	I'm about to go get my Dad a chocolate malt.
146	Today is his long day at the hospital.
146	He's probably still there.
147	Thanks.
148	where are you?
149	I hear we are staying at 68 for tomorrow at O&R.
150	I understand we have the CES Cove Point storage contracts set up as CES-Cove Point in global.
150	What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up on it.
150	Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America now has 3 storage contracts.
151	All purchases are from COH or CPA Dates Supply deal Market Deal I'm sure I made a few mistakes.
152	Sold Op 8 stuff to CES (deal 155238) 28th thru 31st.

157	Purchased gas from COH and CPA (deals 157211 & 157213) and sold to EES 157210 for the 28-31st.
158	Bought from CPA (deal 157219) sold to CES (deal 157220) for the 29th-31st.
159	I replaced deal 155238 with 157242 and I fixed the metered volumes for the last day on deal 155244.
160	I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost for January, even if we did not get set up as agent, correct?
161	I just created a deal for TRCO contract 3.3433 (deal 157600).
161	This is the master contract for all ENA deals on rate schedule FTSR.
161	We will be doing nominations under this contract.
162	This is ok.
162	I sold them 767 for the 27th and 28th.
162	I told Bryan to make sure he doesn't need the 767 for the 29th - 31st.
163	We have a 2500 dt/day supply from Equitable in Tenn Z4.
163	This deal is matched with a term sale to FirstEnergy (deal 145648 for Jan and deal 157848 for Feb and Mar).
163	This is a John Singer deal.
163	I have no idea what the price is on the sale to FirstEnergy.
164	Just wanted to make sure you received this.
165	We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal (deal 158112) and sold to EES (deal 158120) for the 29th-31st.
165	This gas is coming from Allied Signal.
165	Lee Tippet thought the contract number was 62672.
165	Joany, would you verify that, thanks.
166	Has CES global contract 96030669 / 65071 been transferred from CES to ENA?
167	How about we move it to ENA.
168	Could you find the deal ticket for Trco k#2.7055?
168	May
169	Sherry is waiting to make the payment - you guys tell me how to set this up (CES - Cove Point or Cove Point)????
170	Hey, we made a mistake and set up tetco contract 892510 as FTS.
170	I killed deal 155389 and created deal 158412.
170	sorry
171	Please set up the following Sonat contract with ENA as agent for CES Pipeline Southern Natural Firmness Firm\ Service Type CSS Rate CSS Term Term
172	We still have CGLF and CGAS contracts showing up as CES and Columbia Market in Navigator.
172	Scott and I will look at contracts 42789, 63115, and 66278.
172	Please let Scott know if you need any of the remaining contracts moved over to ENRON N A. Thanks.
173	I just sold CES 8980 day for 1st and 2nd at the CGAS pool for International Paper - deal 159101.
174	Hi team.
174	Guess what day it is??!!
175	It's ok to increase.
175	I spoke with Kate about it.
175	Increase your Emporia volumes.
176	I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you.
176	Do you have any comments to add?
176	I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and ask them how they would like for me to handle this.
176	Do not share any of this with CES.
176	Thanks.
177	I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor.
177	The price is $3.06.
177	Could you get me the meter numbers?
177	This is what I have so far COH Mrkt Area Monthly Vol Meter
178	I just updated the transport rate and corrected some of the points.
179	Reminder
180	CES was cut 7314 at WGL on CGAS for the 1st.
180	I sold CES the gas on TRCO for the 1st and the 2nd (deal 159474).
181	Per my discussion with Joann, it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at meter 80-03 on CGAS.
182	Opps - for gas flow day 2/1/2000.
183	Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.
183	According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 volumes were 2220 dt's.
183	I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).
183	Please let me know how you sourced the gas.
184	My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd.
184	Brian, do we need to do anything for the 1st?
185	We bought 8000 (deal 160324) and sold it to CES in CPA 4-25 (deal 160327) for the 2nd.
186	Brian with CES just called me and asked if we could take the cut at Colonial?
186	Let me know.
187	Alain and I are meeting for a little drink (maybe dinner too) tomorrow after work.
187	I won't be in the office tomorrow.
187	Alain, my pager number is 1-800-978-1788.
187	You can leave a voicemail or a numeric message.
187	I will call you tomorrow afternoon around 3 or 4 pm.
188	Jim asked me to forward this to you.
188	We should probably discuss this.
189	You're probably gone anyway.
189	I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".
189	Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year.
189	Every year Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane."
189	And every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."
189	One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance."
189	Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."
189	The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars."
189	Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go.
189	The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard.
189	He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word.
189	They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't."
189	Stumpy replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars."
190	A much better "note in bottle thrown out to sea"!!
190	I didn't actually write all this mushy stuff.
190	Someone sent it to me.
191	Zone 5 starts in Madison, Georgia and ends in Fairgax, Virginia.
192	You the Man!!

193	March 2000 or March 2001?
194	Sold 7000 to CES at meter 30AL for tomorrow - deal 169576.
194	The meter is not set up in Sitara.
194	I sent a meter request to Faye Ellis.
195	500 and 800 are both Zone 1
196	Did you do the server bounce for me?
196	If not, it does not have to be done by
197	I know nothing about Sonat.
197	Sorry about that.
198	Hey, I glance at that photo every now and then and all I can say is Huba
199	I promise to be a perfect gentleman (or as perfect as an Aggie can be).
200	When you get a chance would you redraft the CES invoice and call me?
200	Thanks 3-4743
201	Bay States will be sending us an invoice for an Algonquin meter bounce fee.
201	I would like to see when it gets here.
201	It's not in the system, but Meredith and I will take care of after I get the invoice.
201	Please call me if any of you come accross it.
201	thanks cg 3-4743
202	Here is what I have so far.
202	One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi Carter.
202	His number is 713-853-5580.
202	I learned some things today.
202	Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700).
202	Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not make them an offer.
202	Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.
202	But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.
202	Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat with.
202	I get you more scoop later.
203	I just sent you and email.
203	Feel free to mention my name to Ishi.
203	More names later today!
204	CES needs meter 30AL - Allied 7000 day
205	Joann, just do this on the baseload ticket if you can.
205	I do like to see the incremental stuff though.
205	Thanks
206	Sold 7000 to CES at 30AL for the 19th-22nd deal 169576.
206	We are getting the gas at Broad Run
207	Hey, how's my little boy doing?
207	When's the big ski trip?
208	I included this on my worksheet.
208	Here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend.
208	Pager 800-978-1788 does not work at my Dad's house.
208	And, you can leave me a voice message on my pager.
208	Home Phone 713-426-1460 Dad's number 409-858-3818 I won't be going to my Dad's until Sunday morning, returning on Monday.
208	This file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/CES/CES Invoice Thanks
209	GET OUT!
209	No Way?
209	I think I'll change something in the system.
210	I think its just the demand charge.
210	Algon only has 2 firm commodities that we have worked with and both are fairly cheap.
210	Most of the Algon expense is in the demand charge.
211	FYI, not the markets I was hoping to see.
212	Does any of this impact the Central Desk?
213	My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January.
213	Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.
213	We probably will not be able to cover everything at once.
213	We still have a few items to bill.
213	I will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them.
214	I just created "2000bug03.xls" and "2000tran03.xls".
214	Joe, we will continue to use the CES Wholesale tab in the 2000tran03 worksheet.
215	I sold 7000 to CES at the Allied meter for tomorrow - deal 169576.
215	Joann, let the Tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at Broad Run.
216	I knew we would have to address this eventually.
216	CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.
216	I showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow.
216	Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into CGAS at Lebanon.
216	This gets real messy.
216	Is there any way we can refuse this?
216	At first, I was thinking we would have to do this.
216	Now, I don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer.
217	I didn't have this email when I left yesterday.
218	Always a pleasure :o)
219	You go girl!
220	CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.
220	To keep the deal tickets simple, I am showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the month CGAS price.
220	Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).
220	Match this up with 600dth of deal 159319.
220	We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on the 24th.
220	I will let you know if things change.
221	Hey!
221	Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi?
221	Are you going to work for Enron?
221	We get discounted deal tickets to Astroworld every April - you don't want to miss that!!

245	Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport.
245	Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.
245	Also, yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB.
246	Good news, even better when it happens.
246	My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.
246	They still need to reconstruct January.
246	Billing I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES.
246	I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.
246	I want to fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the scheduling fee.
246	The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th.
247	I love Chic Fe Le.
248	11:30 am am Dear Producers and Shippers, In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.
248	We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.
248	Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until: 1.
248	it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 2.
248	CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.
248	We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.
248	If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.
248	Sincerely, Director, Producer Services and Business Development
249	Please match deal 204176 (CES sale Mar-May) with deal 209005 (what do you think, CES buy Mar-May).
250	Please match deal 203315 (CES sale for Mar) with deal 209122.
251	Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting.
251	Example #1 Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of PECO in Z6.
251	What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios; PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.
251	Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?
252	check it out
253	nuthing but retail stuff.
253	Why would anyone do retail stuff?
254	Meredith, please path deal 209359 with 209371 for Jan 31.
254	This should capture the meter bounce fee ENA owes Bay State.
254	Sherry, I don't remember who gave me this invoice.
254	I will leave it on your desk.
255	M, these deals should show up in Unify by lunchtime today.
255	Sherry, you guys should see this after lunch.
255	Thanks.
256	Uhhh- you bet!
257	Call me if you have questions.
258	I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.
258	CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.
258	ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.
258	This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.
258	I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.
258	Comments?
259	Do you think Scott should go to this??
260	Done.
260	Deal 210603 I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.
260	When Dana does her voodoo stuff, this deal will show up.
260	Ms. Franklin, this might be my last contract to set up (he he he <=== evil snicker!).
261	I'm going to change the sell to CES on Monday for now.
261	I will chat with my CES counterpart this afternoon about how to treat this.
262	Joe, it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity.
262	I'm not touching until you and I chat.
262	I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon.
263	She's still a porker as of this morning.
264	I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES Who schedules this gas?
265	Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only.
265	Match deal 211356 with thanks
266	Bryan, it doesn't line up very well but this shows that we received 150 dth at St 85 and delivered 145 to PSNC.

267	Let's see.
267	Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.
267	Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing scenarios."
268	I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract.
268	We have so many.
268	Do you have a Sitara deal number?
269	You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.
269	1.
269	Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail.
269	The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.
269	2.
269	Contract 3.3509 - ???
269	I don't understand this one.
269	Take a look at k#1.3473.
269	Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand estimated in Sitara?
269	I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.
269	Let me know what you find.
270	Scott misspelled your name.
270	I hope I have the right guy.
270	I listed one of the CES issues down below.
270	The other issue I have is pricing.
270	I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the pricing.
270	I will try to get with you this afternoon.
270	Just a note, I bet I spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.
270	Thanks cg

272	Hey Team!
272	Ms. "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now.
272	Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues.
272	She will be the one setting this up in Sitara in the future.
272	Thanks.
273	Just to keep you in the loop.
273	I have not responed to any of these questions yet.
274	Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand.
274	AGL released CES some ESR (offer #18307) and WSR (offer #18210).
274	The demand portion of these contracts being billed on k#1.3473.
274	What's up.
275	Just a note.
275	Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St 85 or the PSNC transport.
275	This is a new contract each month - we are currently
276	I luv trucks.
276	I was injured on Sunday, I use crutches now.
277	Hi.
277	I will not be able to attend because I'm dislocated my ankle and I'm crutchin it now.
278	Who wuz receiving the bills on contracts 2.6598 and 2.6592 in December?
278	Wuz it CES or Union Camp?
278	Thank U
279	Not for me, I'm injured - I dislocated my ankle on Sunday.
280	Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings, Bridgeport ...)
281	I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.
281	Jerry was taking the class with me.
281	He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..
281	If I was sitting in a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot was facing North East.
281	I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.
281	I didn't hear this but the Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".
281	He popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray.
281	I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up.
281	I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.
281	Right now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.
281	I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.
281	What are you looking for in a truck?
282	Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis?
283	I have mixed comments on Dodge's.
283	I think either of the other vehicles are perfect.
284	Did you get the PSNC invoice?
284	Can I throw mine away now?
285	Personally, I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17" wheels. To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool.
286	Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.
286	I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.
286	Could you path those deals and email Mark when you are done.
286	Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify after Meredith paths the gas.
286	Just a note, we will probably be billed interest because the payment is late.
286	I think it was due on 2/26/2000.
287	How does this deal work - deal 165385?
288	Opps.
288	Wrong worksheet
289	This is what I have.
289	Good luck.
290	Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.
290	For CNG, I would prefer to have the Cornwell space.
290	I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.
290	Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are starting April?
291	Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti.
291	His phone number is 713-853-6320.
291	I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek numbers (with Scott Goodell as my backup).
291	I will forward the bid week numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers.
291	After bidweek, you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and myself for all East Desk issues.
291	Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

292	Looks good.
293	Hey!
294	Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?
294	It was highlighted in red in the 2000ces02.xls sheet.
294	I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and highlighted it in yellow.
294	And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to
295	Same thing on k#65403 And k#65534 - I left this one in red.
296	Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.
296	When you estimate your flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 3000 dth.
296	I will try to remind you.
296	Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000 "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

298	Jeff Porter and I have discussed this several times over the last week.
299	I believe Beverly uses this to get the gas from Nat Fuel to Transco.
300	Look a funny!
301	This was the original message Jeff Porter was responding to.
302	When you get a chance, would you path out deal 211642 please?
302	For Feb and Mar?

305	Of course, her Mom is an expert.
306	Nope.
306	That would involve reading.
307	Dear Mom, Let's try this with Beal.
307	Daisy (woof woof)
308	Should we stop withdrawing?
309	Hey.
309	What is your professional opinion about this?
309	This was sent to me by my scheduler.
309	I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each month.
309	True?
309	SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION: In accordance with P.S.C.
309	No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.
309	If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you.
309	However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.
309	The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.
309	Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April.
309	If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041.

313	I will not be attending.
314	CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.
314	The request was made by Kim Novesak??
314	I will be out this afternoon.
314	Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.
314	Thanks
315	Sorry guys.
315	I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.
315	I estimate that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day.
315	Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having.
316	Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?
316	I would like to see it if we do.
316	I don't show any record of a deal like this.
316	I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this.
317	Brian, we have a deal we can't identify.
317	Do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?
317	It looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.
317	The delivery point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.
317	The price would be somewhere around $16.00.
318	Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production?
319	Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.
319	I just entered a volume for the last day of the month.
319	You don't need to do this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th.
319	Then retrack and balance.
319	Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.
319	You should be able to apply the payments to these deals.
320	I think we are good to go.
321	Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file.
321	I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.
321	I will try to touch base with you later today.
321	Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet.
322	1.
322	The index premium of $.032 is correct.
322	2.
322	Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.
322	You should ask one of those 3 people.
322	Enron North America Corp.
323	Nope.
323	It probably should.
323	It would also be flashed as a reimbursement.
324	I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below.
324	Please call me when you get a chance.
324	Thanks
325	How did it go?
326	Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a better understanding of a specific LDC.
326	I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok.
327	Is your Gain ID "ONX1666"?
328	Kim is taking care of that invoice.
328	Thanks
329	Hi gang.
329	You guys may or may not be interested in this.
329	The files "febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to CES for the month of Feb. The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing.
329	There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.
329	I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.
329	It is a completly manual process.
329	I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing (excellent performance review stuff).
329	I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.
329	Thanks.
330	Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000.
330	My contact, Brian Perrone, said he has not seen them.
331	Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of invoices at one time?
332	Hey - whats this "was" stuff????
333	I'm a bad person.
333	I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775 Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 217854.
333	This gas is for Atistech.
333	I assume we schedule that.
334	I'm so sorry.
334	I hope things go well for you.
335	Hey, I'm not going to the party tonight.
335	My William's ticket is yours.
336	Would you research this please?
336	Thanks
337	I spoke with Brian at CES .
337	He does not show this deal in his records.
337	I don't show it in my records either.
338	I got it.
338	Thanks
339	Attached is the storage schedule for CES.
339	Scott, according to Colleen, this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track.
340	I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace else.
340	The monthly demand charge is $125,000.00.
341	CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur, or Fri.
341	Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like to meet with CNG.
341	I may or may not be here.
341	Thanks
342	And modest too.
343	Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG Field Services for January.
343	The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.
343	The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.
343	I'm not sure what to tell him.
343	I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).
344	AND you are a good cook and you smell good too!
345	There is only a small chance that I will attend.
345	Vic, make sure and/or Angie go.
346	Robin purchased 8500 dts from Con Ed intra day on the 15th.
346	These are the changes I made in Transit on contract 3.2067 Activity Prev Volume New Volume 767169 25000 15000 Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 6571 down by 10000 789154 0 1500 Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 1183 up by 1500 789274 0 8500 ???
346	Robin or Kate will go to jail for this one.
347	Nope.
347	I think Gloria is though.
347	I know Victor is but he is out the rest of this week.
348	Nope.
348	Cove Point is a wholesale asset.
349	My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.
349	What's bad is CES has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill them a lot more for it.
349	That does not mean they agree to the pricing.
350	Would you guys please give the latest CGAS number for CES?
350	You know, thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA, CALP, and Dayton transport.
350	Thanks
351	I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.
351	I would like to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.
351	It involves several pipelines.
351	Who should I talk to?
351	On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and sell the gas to CES on injections.
351	On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection schedule.
351	However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions.
351	Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens.
351	I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how to do it.
351	Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?
352	I want to make sure Joni sees everyting on CGAS as well.
353	Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.
353	We don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.
353	We do have copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb. The invoices are addressed to ENA which is good enough for me.
353	I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless someone has an objection.
353	Brenda will give a copy of the contract to Sylvia.
353	Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.
353	Also, the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way.
353	Let me know if you have questions.
353	thanks cg
354	Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.
354	When you get back, let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes.
355	FYI - need an upgrade on the 22nd.
355	thanks
356	I understand.
356	I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES.
356	If we used it to serve CES, I should have called CES to negotiate a price and thats what I don't see in my records.
357	I guess we won't be having dinner for a while, huh?
358	The web site is in the first paragraph.
358	Have fun!
359	As you all know I'm handicapped and its not because I'm a agiee.
359	Borrowed 10,000 dt from CNG Transmission intraday on the 17th, deal 219976.
359	Payback 10,000 dt over the weekend, 18th-20th, deal 219982.
359	ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the ending daily balance.
359	Please let me know if you have any questions.

361	I made a mistake the Borrowed deal is 220270 the payback deal is 220254
362	I extended Sitara deal 143323 thru march.
362	This is a Boston Gas release to CES SS-1 contract.
362	Should we release this to ENA?
363	Nope.
364	Nope.
365	Let's try this again.
365	I now have all the deals.
365	Today, I took the price to 0 for the following deals 209176 and 209178.
365	All the other deals do not have any pricing.
365	I would like to know the economic impact of taking the prices out before Scott see this in the morining report.
366	Ohh my poor ankle!!
366	Do you care?
367	I changed the price on deal 145638.
367	I show we should make about $19,000.00.
367	Let me know what you see,.
368	Good.
368	I'll be expecting you.
369	I just set up a new storage contract for Egan Hub Partners.
369	Deal 205633.
370	What's your work number?
370	I'm updating my Lotus Notes Database and I left my day planner at home - too much weight in the backpack.
371	I just changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 6.423 (deal 205687).
371	I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).
371	We were billed 6.423 in January.
371	That's an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50.
372	I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices.
372	Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff.
372	However, I getting copies as I work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan. I will make copies an send them to Brian.
372	Brian, what is your mailing address?
373	The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.
373	This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.
373	I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.
373	Which one of you is it?
373	I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.
373	Susan, you can toss this.
374	I sold another 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES
375	I had this filed in the wrong spot.
375	These are John's citygate production deals.
376	Hey Doug, could you change my email address in your system to thanks
377	Hey Buddy, would you change my email address to Chris.Germany@enron.com please.
377	Thanks
378	I will assume you de' man on this one.
379	This deal terminates effective 3/31/2000.
379	FYI - all BUG terminate effective
380	Done!
380	What's next?
381	I updated the Transco rates and fuel for April.
381	It is in the "Offseason Rate" tab in the "2000tran03" file.
382	I tried calling you last night but your phone just kept ringing.
382	AND, John Kinder called me this morning and told me I didn't get my capacity.
382	He said the winter goes for max rate and I bid $.16, but the goober would not give me a good feel for what it went for.
383	It's not in the worksheet.
384	I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.
384	Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.
384	I changed the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool (deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.
384	1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.
384	.1045 variable cost mainline to Leach .0250 demand charge Please let me know if you have any questions.
385	For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, and Hanley & Bird.
385	According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.
385	Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.
385	1.
385	Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.
385	At today's prices we save: Savings Tenn Variable $.0491 at $3.00 CNG Fuel $.0672 at $2.88 Total Savings $.1151 At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie 2.
385	Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.
385	We save the CNG fuel cost.
385	This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer.
386	I always have time for you.
386	I'm out all day tomorrow.
387	funny.
387	Oh my poor foot.
387	Noone cares about me.
388	Looks pretty empty so far.
389	That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke???
390	I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.
390	CGLF k#64502 ; This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West Cam Devon production.
390	The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts and the commodity is $.0024.
390	According to my notes; this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648 I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the worksheet.
391	I don't think 3rd times a charm.
391	Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy???
392	For Jan, the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $200.00 Enron Capital Management
393	I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite, Mr. Goodell will be a busy fellow.
393	I think I visit Tahitti
394	That's ok.
394	I need to buy back the gas CES is not taking.
394	I think that will be easier to do after the month is over.
394	I will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last day of the month.
395	Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know.
396	Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.
396	She laughed when I said gave her the volume of 100,000.
396	The most she will consider is 50,000.
396	So I told her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in demand charges each month.
396	She needs to think about it.
396	I'm out tomorrow but I will call her.
396	Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next.
397	i added deal 223021, cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara.
397	what is this capacity for?
397	its FTS 1 at rate $1.1600
398	pulled up deal 158501 and added a demand charge for k#66394
399	What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on Feb 23rd?
399	I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.
399	MDQ = 5000 and the rate is $.01?
399	Who did this deal?
399	The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.
399	The delivery point is Rayne.
399	It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.
399	I'm setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I entered it in Sitara deal 223022.
399	Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.
400	I need to pull my tapes for Jan 21st.
400	Would you take care of that please?
401	Is Dayton showing the price to be To me it looks like options 2.
401	Enron North America Corp.
402	This is ok for March.
403	I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara (deal 224977) effective 4/1/200 thru 10/31/2000.
403	Dick, Scott, the sales price is trigger deal priced at NX1 + $.22.
403	Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the CGAS pool.
403	My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus (phone 412-394-2953).
403	David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through Dick's book.
404	Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round.
404	This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand during the summer.
404	Depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport (at least with the way things work in our systems).
405	Yuck!
405	Some of this looked spooky.
405	Baseball tickets: you and your buddy Maureen go to the game on Tuesday, June 6th.
405	I believe the Astro's play MIN.
406	According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS + .015.
406	I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001.
407	Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke pricing has me curious.
407	Do I need to check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?
407	I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's GMS system.
407	Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about the deals.
407	I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in Sitara.
407	Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara.
408	I guess my new address is chris.germany@enron.com
409	I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.
409	Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.
409	ENA is buying this gas Let me know if you have questions.
410	That stuff will just make you fat!
410	You keep that up and you will never have a slim & trim figure like I do!!
411	What do I get if I break the chain?
412	Yep.
412	I'm a wild man now.
413	You know all and see all.
413	Who can I start sending all these pricing questions to?
413	Enron North America Corp.
414	I'm thinking about getting a "Hang Glidin" tatto.
415	Them's fightin words!
415	Ahh my poor ankle.
415	It's just about time for me to leave I think.
416	Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.
416	I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.
416	Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?
417	Hey Pops!
417	Here is the deal.
417	If you can verify that you recieved this message, you can have Jerry's jet ski.
417	That's right, its FREE!!
417	Just call me up within 10 days from the receipt of this email and say the word "BULL" and you've got yourself one semi-used jet ski.
418	Earth day info.
419	We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be taking it out during April (deal 225534).
419	ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt = $1,500.00 in April.
419	Please let me know if you have questions.
420	Oh it hurts so bad.
420	Sure wish I had a Diet Coke to take my mind off the intense pain.
421	Hi Team!
421	I just extend CNG deal 116090 through 1/31/2001.
422	Hey, I just undid what I did because the deal already exist under ENA - Market East.
422	Thanks dude!
423	I would change it to an IT gathering contract.
423	I didn't know we had any firm gathering in the Market area.
423	And currently, I am not working on the other gathering contracts.
424	Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.
424	She and I will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.
424	Actually, you could set the priorities for us.
424	What should we work on first?
425	We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.
425	ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily balance on the 28th.
425	This gets confusing because we already have a parking deal from the weekend that comes out in April.
426	I sure did work hard on this didn't I?
427	You de' Woman!!
428	What's the word Mr. Goodell?
428	I'm thinking there is no demand charge and this acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand.
429	i'm all over it.
430	I executed the Bug capacity for April.
430	Offer #16219, vol=103, k#892865, deal numbers 229304/229314 I set it up under MarketEast and East with Market East as primary.
431	Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up under 2 desk, Market East and East.
431	All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, and Tenn will be set up under both desk.
431	All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.
431	Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes away on 4/1, or East.
431	So even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk.
432	Hi team.
432	I may be inviting you to a chat on Thurs.
433	All very good questions and NO, we don't have an anwser.
434	Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059.
434	We did this exact setup on several contracts today.
435	My fault.
435	I should have sent this out this morning.
436	I have all of you set up in my group profile for CES now.
437	Enron North America Corp.
438	Hi team.
438	FYI - I just received the CALP invoice for Feb today in my inbox.
438	I mailed it to Mark just so he could have a non-faxed copy for his files.
439	Anytime.
439	I'll buy you a beverage next time you come down.
440	Hey!!
440	It worked!
440	Ankle is ok.
440	I will start using your stock tips soon.
441	I don't remeber, who was taking care of changing the CES counterparties?
441	Was that someone in Global?
442	Robin said you are going to be doing some of the Inside Ferc numbers.
442	I'm out Friday so I'm sending this to you now.
443	I'm there.
443	I'm out Friday.
443	Also, Molly will be full time CES starting next week.
443	Kim, please reserve a room for a conference call for one hour starting at 11:00 am this Thursday.
444	Hi Steph.
444	Are you busy?
444	Look - work!!
445	Please review the following discrepancy and let me know what the price should be.
446	I'll be needing a "significant other" for the party.
446	Do you have any spares?
447	Created deal # 231048 to net out against Z6 sales on 527 a day.
447	Molly
448	I would like to see the tickets for deals 100093 and 100096.
448	Thanks
449	Look guys - I suspect these are deal entry problems as opposed to deal valuation problems.
449	Please take a look.
449	Should I just enter these deals in Sitara for now (just for April) and let you know what the new deal numbers are?
450	We have a new service on CNG.
450	Pipeline CNG Transmission Start Date 2/1/2000 - 2/29/2000 evergreen Firmness IT Service Type Pooling Service Buyer ENA - Im Market East Brenda, for now the rates on this service will be 0.
451	Mr. Monroy entered deal 218918 in Sitara on 3/15/2000 with a Tagg # NC3056.
451	I don't know who this is.
451	Could you let me know which trader did this deal please.
452	You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my capacity.
453	Hi gang.
453	I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb. We will have to look at it next week.
453	Deal 162283 and 162282.
453	We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois.
453	we will chat.
454	Your back!!!
454	I almost called Spencer to chat.
455	We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an "East" desk pipe as oppossed to "Market East".
455	Please let me know if you think there might be any problems.
456	thanks
457	FYI
458	I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached.
458	I will discuss this with Charlie.
459	Glad to hear things are going well.
459	talk to you later,.
460	Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non bidable.
460	Scott, it looks recallable.
460	Its parcel number 28464.
460	Vol=7500, receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.
460	The rate is Everything looks good except the recallable factor.
460	Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.
460	I can't get my machine to print out the forms.
460	Good Luck.
461	Hi Team!
461	I will be out of the office on Friday, March 31st.
461	Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have.
461	Later
462	Transco Beverly has all the numbers.
462	Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed.
462	Beavy has the offer numbers.
462	We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.
462	Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next Wed.
462	We ran out of credit on ECT.
462	Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in the morning.
462	Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be executed.
462	AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.
462	Kathy, you might be able to do this too.
462	Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.
462	Remember, we did CNG We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.
462	I just never got around to requesting them.
462	Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters and Hanley & Bird 21100.
462	I left her a voicemail to call you.
462	Ask her if we can send in the paperwork next week.
462	Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick know what fuel waivers CNG approves.
462	I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet.
462	I will be calling in the morining.
463	Hey, you should see us up here.
463	We are real nice and close.
463	I was out Friday and we moved from 31 to 32.
463	The schedulers are up here with us, although we are so far apart, you still need to use the squawk box to chat with 'em.
464	Hey guys.
464	I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.
464	I'm only here 1/2 day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department changed floors over the weekend.
464	Let me know if there are any issues we need to address right away.
464	Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.
464	Thanks.
465	I need to check on this.
465	I need to make sure we are not paying for this.
465	If it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the transport.
466	Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.
466	This is the first time I've heard about this.
466	I believe Joanie said this capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.
466	I need to know if we have to take this space.
466	I would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to.
466	Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management group.
467	I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th.
467	Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's.
467	Thanks
468	This deal has been entered a CNG South Citygate deal and it should be entered and CNG Appalachian production.
468	Jim Javins said he thought the deal was behind hastings.
468	Could you guys move it.
468	I would but Mr. Tengle yelled at me about messing up the risk assignments.
469	T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.
469	Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.
469	CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.
469	T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.
469	The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system.
469	We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.
469	T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up?
469	Also, John wants to know if he should sign the letter?.
469	Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.
470	Hey dudes, we need someone to attend this.
470	I'm thinking Scott Goodell should go.
470	Let's chat.
471	I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April.
471	Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this.
471	Also, send me your phone number.
471	I can't find it.
472	Hey John, did CES take this gas for Jan, Feb, and Mar?
472	Wade would like to see this deal in the system.
473	If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).
473	If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.
473	Metered production or pool gas on CNG?
474	OK this is metered production on CNG.
474	Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
474	The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES production.
474	After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal in Sitara with a zero volume.
475	Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round OR $.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.
475	The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.
476	I faxed a copy of the PSNC invoice for March to Brian Perrone.
476	I show this as a purchase from CES at St 85.
476	Also, I believe March is the last month CES is taking the gas from CES.
476	Brian, I'm tossing my copy, let me know if you have questions.
476	Thanks.
477	I would like to have the following 2 speed dials added to Page 10, thanks
478	Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday.
478	He is requesting copies of the transport invoices.
478	Should I give the invoices to him or should I send them to Charlie?
479	Hi Anita, my name is Chris Germany and my phone number is 713-853-4743.
479	My fax number is 713-646-8453.
479	I believe you and I will be working together.
480	We can do that.
480	Brian, would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF invoices for January?
480	We will take care of everything else.
480	thanks
481	I guess you won't be taking me out for a cheeseburger this evening will you ?
482	Actually, cheeseburger and a shake!!
483	I'm going through the Jan transport invoices.
483	I see I need to bill CES for some South Georgia activity.
483	How did we pay South Georgia, I don't see a matrix in Unify.
484	Big Bang??
484	Are you saying I was born out of the lowest form of life on earth?
485	I've gone through most of the CES stuff for Jan. I'm missing several demand charge contracts and commodity for CES on Trco.
485	I think you need to call me.
486	Brian, I'm Fed Exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the following exceptions: Transco: I missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity charges.
486	I am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and I will be making a billing adjustment this Friday.
486	I have not review all the invoices I am sending you.
486	And I have made copies for Don.
486	I will give him his copies on Friday or Monday.
486	Let me know if you have any questions.
487	I do love chocolate malts though.
487	i guess that's what us low life forms live on.
488	Hi campers.
488	Its that time of month again, I need all the transport information for CES for March.
489	I apologize for this.
489	May I get a copy of all the invoices we sent CES for January please.
490	I think the National Fuel is local production.
490	I'm don't know how you would swing this volume.
491	Do we still need to be transporting Bridgeport CNG produciton gas through Coronado to CGAS?
491	AND if YES, will this gas always need to go through Coronado?
491	I thought that was just a seasonal thing
492	The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM gathering and transmission contracts.
492	Unless someone objects I would like to get this moved over to Enron's pool.
492	We don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over.
493	I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.
493	I'm working fast and furious on March.
493	I was going to do most of April next week with Molly.
493	Can I give it to you then?
493	Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you are ok with that.
493	Just let me know.
493	I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins.
493	I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage.
493	For now, I will allow the intra day changes.
494	Well, aren't you just full of wisdom!
495	Melissa, am I at liberty to discuss pricing information and to provide my price calculation worksheets (transport capacity and pricing worksheet) with Don Kirkendall?
496	Thanks.
497	FYI, I just wanted to make sure we had CES's approval.
498	As always, they catch me at my most beautiful pose.
499	We received a prior period adjustment (December activity) on the JanuaryTransco invoices for CES.
499	Its a credit of $6,432.31.
499	Its releated to the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.
499	This credit should be passed through to CES.
499	How is that being handled?
500	It looks like I'm missing demand charges on the following CES Transco contracts for January
501	I think I might call.
501	Would you take me our for a free lunch?
502	You bet.
502	Don't you think we could send something a little better?
503	C'mon - I want a free lunch.
503	I could interduce you to a new place, real close to work.
504	I've been in you house since then.
504	I also have a doggie book in the back of my car that belongs to you.
505	Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.
505	I think all you need to do is send CNG a letter requesting; "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".
505	If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they send to Gloria, I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.
505	Let me know if you have any questions.
505	thanks
506	oh it is not.
506	You Lie!
507	There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.

507	My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.
507	According to Unify the downstream k# is 94946.
507	If you did this deal, do you remember who you did the deal with?
507	Thanks.
508	Present this email at a time of MY convenience and receive 1 free $.50 beverage from the 32 floor pop machine!!

513	Thanks
514	We parked gas (deal 240072) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out (deal 240073) on the 10th.
514	ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily balance.
515	We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.
515	The volume is 34,248 dts and the price is $2.22.
515	I did not Bill CES for this deal.
515	According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the gas and we paid it back in January.
515	Tom said CES was going to pay us for this.
515	Should I bill the Retail group for this?
515	It looks more like a wholesale transaction.
516	I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.
516	Matt, why don't you go in my place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..
516	However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now.
517	Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.
517	I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch.
517	I do have the fax you sent.

520	My January worksheet

521	Ankle is doing ok.
521	I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work.
521	I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.
522	Hey guys.
522	I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed.
522	Comments?
523	This is a good time to bring this up.
523	Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.
523	From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.
523	Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.
523	2.
523	It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.
524	Hey guys.
524	I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found.
524	The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom.
525	Hey Sparky!
525	FYI.
526	Hey gang.
526	Dan caught my mistake.
526	Tenn fuels change in April.
526	March April CNG Index $2.79 $3.06 Receipt Price $2.6029 $2.9327
527	I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb. They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.
527	Give me a call once you get these.
527	cg
528	Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.
528	I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".
528	The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1".
529	I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.
529	The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.
529	Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm.
529	Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.
529	Please let me know if you will be attending.
529	I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending.
530	Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.
530	Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though.
531	Chewies on the way!!!!
532	NO.
532	CALP is a wholesale contract.
533	Don't I always get back to you within 10 min????
534	OK.
534	Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume.
535	Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday, April 12th around 2:30pm.
535	thanks
536	Hey gang.
536	Joanie is still working on current day activity.
536	Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447.
536	I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day.
537	Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please?
537	Thanks
538	The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.
538	Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.
538	This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.
538	What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.
538	April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.
538	CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.
538	The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals.
538	Which brings up the following issues; * How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility.
538	Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.
538	How did that work?
538	Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.
538	* How do we track the storage balance in Unify?
538	* How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.
538	Thanks Enron North America Corp.
539	FYI
540	Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084.
541	Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez?
541	Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached.
542	Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other.
542	Thanks
543	I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.
543	I should have February to you by next week some time.
544	What happens if we sell CES spot gas??
544	It would be fixed price.
544	Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.
544	What do you think??
545	Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.
545	Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.
545	Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.
545	Thanks
546	Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.
546	Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.
546	We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets.
546	According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4.
546	I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.
546	I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF and make the premium $.01.
546	I have not brought this to CES's attention.
546	They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.
547	Seen this one?
548	According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.
548	I not concerned about the June 1998.
548	Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?
548	thanks
549	Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.
549	I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.
549	I added the actual numbers per navigator.
549	I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.
549	What do you guys think?
550	Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.
550	I'm still working on the purchases.
550	I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.
550	AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.
550	I call you with that number.
551	Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.
551	Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice.
552	This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.
552	This is the first I've heard of this.
552	Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.
552	I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.
552	Also, I have a copy of the March bill.
552	I will go through it today and give Mark a copy.
552	Thanks.
553	Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment.
553	Robin called Roman and gave him the info.
553	thanks Joanie.
554	I love being a MAN!!!
554	Ain't life great?
555	Hey, thats Mr. Turd to you.
556	Hi gang.
556	Lunch with CES is on Wednesday, that day works better with Jeff.
557	You may not see this deal come through the normal process.
557	Please set up deal 245855.
557	Thanks Brenda, this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me.
558	I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet.
558	k#892722 - You De Woman!!!
558	k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318
559	Each month, Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES.
559	Please send him the Feb and Mar activity.
559	His phone number is 703-561-6472, his fax number is 703-561-7317.
559	You and I may need to chat.
560	All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.
560	Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today.
560	We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some March) invoices.
561	I don't know a thing, but I think Mr. Goodell is an expert.
562	Responses: 1.
562	I'll let Kevin answer this one.
562	ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.
562	2.
562	I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.
562	If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001.
562	However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April.
562	I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we are buying back gas at GD - $.01.
562	3.
562	Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?
562	Does Duke bill CES directly for this?
562	4.
562	See attached worksheets.
562	5.
562	I don't know all the information on the local production yet.
562	The pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing using ENA transport).
562	The attached April file has a Local Production tab.
562	Molly Johnson is updating this information.
562	After she completes April, she will recreate Jan - Mar. 6.
562	Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes.
562	For pricing purposes, I only care about total daily deliveries.
562	It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity.
562	This holds true for most other pipelines as well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...
562	This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up.
562	The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa.
563	Transport Pricing info Formula Where: DP = Delivered Price RP = Receipt Price Commodity = Usage Rate ($.0226 on CGAS) The password is 2000tran04.
564	Ain't I just the nicest guy you know, MODEST TOO!
565	My fault.
565	The numbers in yellow are estimates.
566	CES Contact
567	UGI ships the gas for CES.
567	Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.
567	It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.
567	Doug will verify this information and let us know.
568	We have a new Cove Point Storage deal, here are the details; Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March $234,000.00/month Contract FPS1024 The CPR storage injection deal is 246517, the withdrawal ticket is 249409.
568	I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March,.
569	Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.
569	That should give us 812 day injected for May.
569	This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.
569	I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May.
570	Just making sure everyone reads their emails.
570	The term is 4/15/2000 -
571	Sorry, I sent this to you by mistake.
572	We have our CES/Bug contract for May.
572	The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255.
573	Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and Thanks. I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000.
574	What are you talking about?
575	This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.
575	I feel much better about this part.
575	Thanks Brenda.
576	I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.
576	The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.
576	This deal is for 1 day only.
576	The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.
576	Thanks
577	Thanks for the reminder.
577	I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins, Direcotor, Enron North America.
578	Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.
578	The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.
578	The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like.
579	Lizy, I don't know how you see these the next morning.
579	Please check deals 252056 (primary) and 252057, I just set these up in Sitara.
579	This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara.
579	Thanks.
580	FYI
581	Do you guys know which contract this is?
582	This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January.
582	The MDQ is 2300.
582	Thanks Joanie!
583	Please change the following deals to evergreen.

588	Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.
588	I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.
588	thanks
589	Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.
589	The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).
589	I just killed deal 231301.

593	"Moths" A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well.
593	They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making.
593	The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got home, go hide in the bathroom!"
593	So the man runs into the bathroom.
593	Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her.
593	"Why are you naked?"
593	he asks.
593	Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you."
593	"Okay."
593	the man replies "I'll go get ready."
593	He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands. "Who the fuck are you?"
593	the man asks "I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with."
593	The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"
593	The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise. "Those little bastards!"
594	Do you know if this has been addressed?
595	They are all in really bad shape.
595	May is looking pretty good though.
596	Has this been addressed?
597	FYI
598	CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.
598	thanks
599	It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working.
599	Take a look at deal 98243.
599	I just had to extend the date for May
600	I think Alicia fixed this last week.
600	Take a look and let me know.
601	We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet.
601	The deal number is
602	Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop?
603	Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.
603	For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.
603	When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be I will try to monitor the deal volume.
603	Thanks.
604	Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.
604	Does this sound correct to you?
604	Please let me know.
605	I took the volumes to 0 on the following deals Deal 257285 CES Exchange Buy and deal 257287 CES sale - term 4/1/2000 - Deal 257288 CES buy and deal 257289 CES Exchange sale - term 11/1/2000 - Thanks
606	What do I need to do?
606	Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?
606	Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)?
607	Hey, regarding deals 226462 and 258420, should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462?
608	I think everything is OK now.
608	I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).
608	I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May.
608	Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May.
609	I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.
609	I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.
609	Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket?
609	Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).
609	Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?
610	I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.
610	There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify.
611	Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?
611	I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.
611	Thanks.
612	Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.
612	Cora gave a description of the invoice below.
612	Let me know what you think.
612	Thanks
613	I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.
613	I tried the other connection and it works great.
613	I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem.
613	I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.
613	All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.
614	Hi gang.
614	I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal.

615	Kim, I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow.

616	We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow.
617	Hi gang.
617	We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.
617	I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.
617	The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else.
617	Per my discussion with Christine, the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone; Meter Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.
618	Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet?
619	Deal 125925 has been replaced with deal 231766 and deal 125928 has been replaced with deal 234584.
619	Angie is all over this one.
620	I have a new toy!

624	I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport split out by East and Marketeast.
625	I send it to your work address tonight buddy.
625	You de Man.
626	That little project has been killed.
626	I don't think Father needs another animal to take care of.
627	Kim, I'm at a CNG shipper meeting in Florida next Wed - Fri.
627	Enron North America Corp.
628	Molly will chat with you about this and Molly just found out about it.
628	Hi Molly!!
629	Do you need a HUG??
629	:o)
630	I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4) change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.
630	Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.
630	Please verify which price is correct.
630	The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175.
630	Please verify which price is correct.
631	Done, please review the following zones.
631	They are different from last month's pricing.
631	TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.
631	I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it.
632	I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.
632	I will try again tonight.
632	It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email.
633	Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.
633	This is how it will work, Deal # Comment 268093 CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090 CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094 CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.
633	The volume should not change.
633	The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.
633	When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.
633	When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.
633	When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.
633	This may seem a little confusing.
633	Please call me if you still have questions.
633	Thanks
634	FYI
635	Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.
635	Thanks.
635	We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more.
636	You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.
636	I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct.
637	we will showing CES a bid today.
638	I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.
638	Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.
638	Thanks
639	We can use it as far as I'm concerned.
639	Have the reimbursements been addressed?
640	We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.
640	This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale.
640	Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us.
640	Type: EFP Differential: $.235 Point: Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999 Sitara Deals: 158716/227890 the price in sitara is Tco Index.
640	Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.
640	I will gladly give this to David.
640	Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara.
640	Thanks.
641	Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.
641	The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.
641	I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.
641	Thanks
642	I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.
642	The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.
642	The total demand for these charges was $18,424.
643	I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.
643	We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.
643	For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000 That's all for now.
644	As usual, you are awesome!
644	Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them.
644	Thanks
645	New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.
645	There is a new virus going around, called "work."
645	If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.
645	This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.
645	If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap... I'm off to the bar."
645	Your brain should automatically forget the "work".
645	If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can.
645	Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer (or rum punch).
645	After repeating this action 14 times, you will find that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever.
646	Did Cove Point approve that?
647	I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch.
648	Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?
648	I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.
648	I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.
648	I'll keep you posted.
649	Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.
649	Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.
649	Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.
649	Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month.
649	EES cannot take any Peoples gas.
649	Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?
649	I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.
649	Marde is going to check around.
650	Yep.
650	So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right?
651	I just spoke with CES.
651	CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.
651	Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything.
651	I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.
651	I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow.
652	Hey you said I could delete this one.
652	Yea!!
653	Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice??
654	We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day) through July.
654	Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.
654	Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.
654	ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES.
655	Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June?
656	Hey!!
656	You still exist!!
657	One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket.
658	As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.
658	We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount.
658	In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August.
659	May cash $4.00 June Numbers CNG Basis Bid $.215 CNG Index Prem (.0075) Net $3.9875 actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95% Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08)
660	Scott Goodell will be attending as well.
660	Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please?
661	I killed deal 233231.
661	The contract number was incorrect.
662	Hi!
663	Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.
663	Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq.
664	I thought the meter numbers were different.
665	Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS, Boss :o)
666	In today's Gas Daily, Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job!
667	I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.
667	I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.
667	It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.
667	Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.
667	If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.
667	Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.
667	I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow.
667	Thanks.
667	cg
668	I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara.
668	Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000.
668	Deals 165415 and 165423.
669	Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.
669	I'm sure I left someone out.
669	This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.
669	This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.
669	East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note: this is an estimated volume.
669	We should know the actual volume in the next day or so.
669	Note: CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.
669	National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.
669	The deal expires 6/30/2000.
669	All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.
669	ENA nominates this gas.
669	CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.
669	CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.
670	I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000.
670	My mistake.
671	its a good thing i a good looking stud!
672	We have the following Transco transport for June Contract .7537 (does not include any AGL space) Vol Comment 5000 3-6 Con Ed space released month to month thru 10/31/2000 Contract 3.4367 Other stuff 20000 of 6-1 I think.
672	6500 of 6-6 from PSEG.
672	Open for bids until 2:00pm on 4/26/2000 2174 of 2-3.
672	this is on k#.7537
673	John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.
673	This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.
673	I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.
673	This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.
673	The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).
673	John, is this price adjusted for dth??
673	I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.
673	This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.
673	David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
673	Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.
673	I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.
673	This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.
673	According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.
673	It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563.
673	I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.
673	This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.
673	John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.
673	Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?
673	Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.
673	This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.
673	Let me know if anyone has any questions.
673	Thanks cg 3-4743
674	Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company.
675	It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.
676	I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093.
676	Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.
676	We will show this volume coming out in June.
676	I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August.
676	I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.
676	Let me know if you have any questions.
677	We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).
677	ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.
677	Angie, these volumes may go up.
677	I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long.
677	Clarissa will let you know.
678	Whoo hooo!
678	I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.
678	This affects our demand charges on CGAS.
679	Done.
680	I didn't even know about deal 219618.
680	I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading.
681	I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.
681	However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.
681	Transco Offers CNG Offers Let me know if you have any questions.
681	Thanks Chris 713-853-4743
682	Hi team.
682	Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.
682	May not be a problem but just in case.
683	I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.
683	We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month.
683	On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
683	On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.
683	This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.
684	Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, Comment?
685	We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.
685	It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.
685	The transport usage deal is 289228.
685	Let me know if you have any questions.
686	Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow.
687	Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.
687	The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.
687	We currently have 20,000 dt in the We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.
687	thanks
688	Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.
688	This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.
688	We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.
688	Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal.
688	Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.
688	There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.
688	(Ex ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).
688	Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.
688	Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.
689	AGA is 78.
689	Screen dipped to $3.95, currently at $4.05 / $4.06
690	Test.
690	Does this work?
691	Bid is bouncing around $4.03 to $4.06
692	Cool

703	I will have training class on the East Desk Market Area positions this Wed, June 21st, at 4:00 PM in conference room EB3084.
703	I will be discussing our operational flexibility with respect to Tenn Z6 and National Fuel.
704	You De Man.
704	Could you change the spelling from Druckett to Dracut?
704	I owe you a Chic Fil A lunch.
705	Hey Jeff, we are meeting tomorrow because Molly is out today.
705	Is that OK?
706	Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?
707	How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?
707	OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)?
708	Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.
708	Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.
708	I don't know if that's dt or mcf.
708	I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.
708	This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.
708	For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.
708	I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.
708	But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.
708	Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.
708	Marde will not sell at that price but I will.
708	Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
708	Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.
708	What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.
708	It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.
708	AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.
708	Comments / Questions?
708	Questions John 1.
708	Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.
708	Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
708	If yes, how many meters?
708	2.
708	Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.
708	Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.
708	I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.
708	At what price will you take these deals?
708	I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this.
709	My YTD nymx and your YTD nymx don't tie.
709	Here is my worksheet.
709	Would take a look at it and let me know which deals are wrong.

720	Does anyone object to that?
720	I will wait until this afternoon before I call.
720	Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?
720	If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.
720	However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.
721	Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?
721	I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility.
721	Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review.
721	Thanks.
722	ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.
722	Sitara deal #225818.
722	EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is correct?
722	Thanks
723	Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.
723	For June, we released this capacity to Energy Express.
723	Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000.
723	I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.
724	We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July.
724	Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.
724	And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell.
725	Hey Greg.
725	Hope this works.
725	My phone number is 713-853-4743.
726	Good job.
726	Now what price should we bill EES.
727	Check out this site:
728	Hey Rhonda, my sources tell me that this $3.324 is the correct price.
728	Thats a big bonus for EES.
729	We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 6/23/2000.
729	National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.
729	We are now long FSS and short PALS.
729	We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.
729	However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.
729	Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.
729	We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.
729	IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).
729	We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.
729	We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.
729	And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.
729	COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.
729	ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.
729	This deal is over on Aug 31st.
729	I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.
729	I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.
729	I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.
729	I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.
729	All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.
729	Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.
729	If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.
729	Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.
729	Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.
729	Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.
729	However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.
729	OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today's prices that cost about $.105 Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.
729	At today's prices, that cost about $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.
729	Tenn - we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).
729	We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.
729	We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.
729	Let me know if you have any questons.
730	Modest Too!!
731	I called Peoples, Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions.
731	I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have not heard from him either.
731	Don't seem like anything is getting done.
731	I hope you had a good weekend.
732	Hey Team.
732	I need the following services set up on National Fuel.
732	IAS <== we just created k# A02353 ISS <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.
732	Believe me, this all happened really fast.
732	I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.
733	Lotus Notes columbus thanks Enron Capital Management
734	My location is EB 3224b and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me.
734	Thanks
735	This transaction involves 5 contracts.
735	Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of ($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.
735	I don't think Nat Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out.
736	Tim, call Dick Jenkins about this capacity.
736	His number is 3-5136
737	Went home and went to bed buddy!
737	So which of the lovely young ladies did you spend time with?
738	Hey buddy.
738	We are having all sorts of problems with St 30, 90% internal.
738	You should try to sell to someone else if possible.
738	Maybe Williams??
739	as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest
740	Hey Team.
740	Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans market and we still have the production.
740	For July, take all of this gas into CNG.
740	You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.
740	You should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.
740	You are all wonderfull people - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).
740	thanks
741	Hi gang.
741	I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle of last week.
741	I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th to be 3,626,785 dth.
741	Let me know if you see something different.
741	Thanks
742	If its Stephanie you die!

745	I would like to RSVP for Chad's party.
746	Hey Buddy!
746	I just had a chat with Kori.
746	She is very sad she didn't get a birthday kiss from you.
746	There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 7th and she will be there.
746	What do you think?
747	FYI.
747	I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170.
747	They are both Trco Non NY.
748	I show no sales to CES for the month of July.
748	I created deal 315460 to bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967.
748	Please let me know if you have any questions.
749	John, call me when you get a chance.
749	I called 330-493-7790 and there is no voicemail.
750	The password is 2000tran07
751	JD is a dead man.
751	Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch!
752	ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio (10,000/month) to EES for the month of July.
752	EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).
752	I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.
752	EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.
752	Heidi, it looks like this pool can be terminated.
752	Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).
752	Heidi is working on that.
752	Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.
752	I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.
752	However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.
752	Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th.
752	Let me know if anyone has any questions.

754	Jesse, I put in a buy deal to purchase the gas back from CES, deal 318748.
754	Robert, I entered a buy and a sale to capture the financial difference on CGAS, deals 318749 and 318750.
754	I may kill these deals if ENA purchases the gas back from CES at Mainline.
754	I'll keep you posted.
755	This is what we have so far.

756	I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.
756	I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th holiday.
756	I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.
757	Hey, send them again.
757	I don't have them.
758	FYI.
758	Also take a look at today's Gas Daily
759	I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update.
760	I'm still looking for other emails.
761	We are borrowing 110,000 dth (deal 322012) on Transco on the 30th and paying the gas back on July 1st (deal 322007).
761	We are paying Trco a one time fee of $.0386 (see below) Volume Fee
762	I will enter this deal in the system and let you guys know what the deal number is.
763	The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.
763	We are using ENA transport and the deliveries are on a secondary basis.
763	The deal number is 322199 and I added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.
763	Robert, Joann, the volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals.
763	Please let me know if there are any questions.
764	Joanie Veselack is leaving.
764	She is going to PG&E in Bethesda
765	We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.
765	The parking deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.
765	When we get cut by an upstream or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the supplies and markets.
766	Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve CanFibre.
766	However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.
766	Per Marde, CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.
766	OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.
767	Shame on you :o)
768	What about my camera info?????
769	How's that going anyway?
769	I forgot I had a marriage "arrangement" in the works!
770	Not hardly.
770	Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?
770	I will also need to travel back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family.
771	Not a problem.
771	She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other stuff.
771	I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie.
772	Yep.
772	Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.
772	Took my woman and went to Jerry's on July 4th.
772	Had a good time.
772	He does a good job cooking on his BBQ pit.
772	I was very tired on Wed though.
773	Colleen, this is the email response I received.
773	Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company called "Capacity Center"?
773	If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is authorizing these payments.
773	Thanks.
774	I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May.
774	I need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount letter.
774	Gloria, Terry does not have the invoice.
774	Could you get me a copy please?
774	Thanks.
775	I love Chic Fil A!@!!
776	Let's try next week, I'm bouncing in and out this week.
776	And THANKS!!!
777	I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission invoice.
777	I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.
777	I believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.
777	I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO Transmission as the service provider.
777	We will still do the noms via CGAS on this contract.
777	However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport expense.
777	According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.
777	I set these charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.
777	The amount are small.
777	Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.
777	Questions??
778	We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.
778	CGAS does not bill us anything on this contract, KO does.
778	KO somehow gets the information from CGAS.
778	That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom.
778	We don't even talk to KO anymore.
778	I wish KO would reference the CGAS contract on the KO invoice.
778	Maybe we could ask KO to do that.
778	I had to chat with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information.
779	Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.
779	We took all the August activity to 0.
779	This is how these deals should be balanced Deal 318562 with 318686.
779	And 318691 with 318682.
779	I'll look at the economics in the morning.
780	I think we should try an evening meal again.
780	This is fun ain't it?
781	I would like to RSVP for Judy Townsend and myself.
781	Is it too late, will we get a free lunch, you how Judy loves a free lunch.
781	Also, we will not be able to attend until around 11:30 am.
781	Let me know it thats ok.
782	OK - what kind of car and where are you and I going on vacation?
783	Here is the transport sheet for July.
783	I believe its fairly current.
784	FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.
784	John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer.
785	This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.
785	The daily volume was 10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).
785	The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 + Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport I just changed the price in Sitara.
785	My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.
785	Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.
785	Please correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.
785	Thanks.
786	Brace yourself.
786	I'm putting in the June charge of $6.26 !!!
786	I just got the invoice today.
787	Too heck with the little toot.
787	What about that camera info???
788	Scoop
789	Hi Gang.
789	Doug found my mistake and the correct price is $4.6913.
789	I changed the price in Sirara.
789	Sorry Jeff.
790	Rosemary's replacement.
791	Anyone there?
791	Helloooooo!
792	I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to
793	I have to look for the house key at home.
793	I know I don't have it on my keyring.
794	I just had a thought.
794	Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.
794	You don't need to do anything with it.
794	Its more of an awareness type thing.
795	Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.
795	If not, please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.
795	The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.
795	The demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly.
795	And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1.
795	Please look at the following contracts/deals.
795	Contract Deal Comment 779234 003589 Boston releasing to CES 771224 003786 ENA releasing to Energy Express Contract Deal Comment 779233 003581 Boston releasing to CES 771225 003785 ENA releasing to Energy Express Thanks.
796	Dan does not know what this contract is used for.
796	I think it has (or had) something to do with the Boston Gas contract.
796	We currently use k#29667 for that.
796	I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000.
796	Comments / questions?
797	I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116.
797	We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight.
798	How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??
798	EES and ENA used corporate guarantees.
798	Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?
798	Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt?
799	Whatever happened to the good ol' days!
800	What about my camera info???
800	Jerry said he could see no problem with you coming to Chad's wedding if you want to.,
801	The exchange deal numbers are 323558 and 323553.
801	Also, I changed the rate on Tenn deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0097.
801	thanks
802	Lynn Burke with the CDC's needs to release some CGAS and CGLF capacity to CES/New Power for August 2000-July 2001.
802	She wants to know who she should release the capacity to for August.
802	????
803	Go to "Bulletin Board" Select "Operationally Available"
804	Thank you for sending my drill book.
804	I believe I have the key your are looking for.
804	I also have a "Dog Care" book that fell out of Daisy's folder when I got her out of "jail".
804	I will have these items delivered to you as soon as possible.
805	Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production.
805	That works out to about 429 day.
805	I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month.
805	AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can.
805	She knows escript pretty well.
805	Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January.
805	Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime.
805	Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.
805	Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
805	With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy.
805	Let me know what you guys think.
806	I tried sending this email about 3 weeks ago and had problems.
806	So here it is.
807	Is this something Scott did for you?
807	He has been handling all the TCO activity.
807	Let me know if this is something I need to do.
808	Sorry dude, I don't have his number.
808	And I finished my first civil war book.
808	I'll try to get that to you.
808	Where should I invest my money?
809	I sold CES 174 dt/day (deal 335917) from the 20th through the 31st, at a delivered price of $4.395.
809	We are using ENA transport for pricing purposes.
810	Chat with Alan at EES, I bet its the same escript you currently use.
810	This might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things.
811	I'll give you a call in the morning around 8:15 am.
811	Later Buddy.
812	I changed the rate on transport usage deal 227992 from $.27 to .32.
812	Impact will be ($18,400) I need your help changing the curve formula - please.
813	FYI The 4,000 the East Desk bought from Ontario for tomorrow will probably get constrained but we wanted to try it.
814	Read below, are you interested?
815	FYI I requested fuel waivers from Canajoharie to Trco-Leidy for Aug and CNG said no.
815	I think they will still have the waivers to most of the citygates though.
816	Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to Oglethorpe on Transco.
816	Current Process ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.
816	New Process ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal and deal 318423, gas daily deal) ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.
816	Curretly, this volume will match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.
817	Just send me $50 and we won't worry about it.
817	I would also like a new golf shirt but I don't think I want the name Clinton on it right now.
817	Try to get me an AEP shirt.
818	Hey, I just created a new deal for this contract effective 8/1/2000.
818	I thought I had done this but I can't find the other deal I created.
818	The new deal #is 340210.
819	Just spoke with Pops.
819	I let him know that his favorite son (ME) will be up there this evening.
819	He thinks I'm in Lufkin.
820	FYI
821	Very nice - now where did you say you and I are going on vacation?
821	I suppose we could make it driving trip to take advantage of your new car!!!
821	Did some boy buy that for you?
822	Hi Gang.
822	Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon.
822	I will probably be out all week.
822	I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and take anyone else that would like to attend.
823	Is Denver around the block??
823	How about Colorado Springs - I think its closer.
824	Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.
824	The start date is the 27th.
824	Currently there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).
824	The min demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.
824	The commodity is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00.
825	Let;s you and I chat this afternoon about getting reimburse from Oglethorpe on Transco.
826	Add the demand to the commodity, that's comes out to $.0505, there is your nickle.
826	However, being that we work for a marketing company and recognize the value of fuel, we take that into consideration.
826	The pipelines don't usually.
827	Yo buddy!!
827	I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES officially.
827	Let me chat with Doug Kinney.
827	I think it will be ok.
827	I also told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total by Pipeline.
827	Get back with you soon.
828	As we discussed on the phone, Mike Garred with CES is requesting a copy of the CES demand charge sheet.
828	Please let me know if you approve.
829	It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the system.
830	Mike, here is the worksheet.
830	The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail East" and "CES Retail Mrkt".
830	Also, CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1.
831	Kim, please note I will be on vacation all next week, Jul 31st through Aug

833	Hey...
833	I'm thinking about having my personal "send off party" this Saturday Night around 9-10 pm at Dean's downtown.
833	I'm having problems getting my e-mail address book set-up, so I may need your help in spreading the word.
833	Married folks with kids...

835	When do you go north?
835	I'm looking at taking you out for a free meal the second week of Augy.
835	I off next week and you know where I'll be.
836	Not too good.
836	Hard to tell right now wether its short term or long term.
836	We will have a better fill for it in about 3 or 4 days.
837	You may already know this - the CNG commodity rates on FT and FTNN changed effective 7/1/2000.
837	New Old Rates
838	I owe you big time.
838	Send me a bill.
839	I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.
839	We made a mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.
839	I do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.
839	This should only be a problem for May and June, I think.
839	Please pay the disputed amounts.
840	Can't make it but thanks for the offer.
840	I do plan on coming up some time this year.
841	Can you help out my buddy Mike?
841	He will probably take us out for a fabulous lunch.
842	ENA sold the 10,000 dth of EOG pool supply from Power Gas Marketing to EES for the month of August at CNG IF flat - this is the same thing we did for July.
843	Got it.
843	Thanks.

845	And we should be getting 17,000 dth of Z3 to Z4 space from MGAG.
845	I have not seen this space posted yet so the earliest we will be able to get this space is tomorrow afternoon.
846	I'm still looking at this.
847	As I mentioned below, we now have 17,000 dth of Z3 to Z4 space for August on Other Items ICTS k#1.8973 we have a discount through Sep 30, 2000 of $.01 per dth, no min or max volume and no fuel.

847	Effective 8/1/2000 - 9/30/2000, we have a baseload supply of 1,000 dth per day from CGAS - Young Women's, this is production gas on CGAS that will only flow to Young Women's during this time frame.
847	Also, Scott Hendrickson purchased 2,300 dth per day from Virginia Power at Young Women's.
847	We can use the ICTS contract for this gas as well.
847	Total Receipts at Young Women's for August is 3,300 dth.
848	East Ohio I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).
848	This deal should get matched with the purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.
848	The deal volume is 10,000 for the month.
848	We have the Power Gas deal thru October.
848	We still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.
848	I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.
848	I didn't want to mess anything up so close to nom time.
848	Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.
848	Thanks.
848	Peoples I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.
848	This volume fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.
848	This deal also goes through October.
848	We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.
848	I did not see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to be corrected.
848	This deal goes through November.
848	The estimated volume for August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..
848	We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.
848	The price on this deal is CNG IF per mcf.
848	Clinton will pay us based on actuals.
848	Let me know if anyone has questions.
849	I just sold 3,000 dth to CES for July 31st, deal 348523.
849	Per Jeff Porter, this is an in-ground storage transfer.
849	Jeff is faxing me the form to transfer the gas from ENA's storage to BG&E's storage account.
849	The transfer needs to be completed by July 31st.

851	I think you can physically flow 5000 to 8000 from Access to
852	Why yes we do and here it is.
852	We create a new worksheet each month.
852	The worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".
852	Assume the rate you are looking at is FT unless specified otherwise.
852	And, depending on what you are looking at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.

853	This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.
853	According to my notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel.
853	It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September.
853	The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September.
853	CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.
853	The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes.
853	So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075.
853	The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228.
854	I took off all last week.

854	The Dr. said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month.
854	They are taking him out of the hospital tomorrow or Wed.
854	I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while.
854	There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack.
855	Hi gang.
855	I will be out of the office quite a bit over the next 4 weeks.
855	Please make sure you copy Scott and Molly on all emails and send all faxes to Scott Goodell, just to make sure we don't miss anything.
855	Thanks
856	Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.
856	AND I just faxed you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.
856	I believe Heidi Boyd told me that ENA was not making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.
856	Let me know what you find out.
856	Please include Scott Goodell on all responses.
857	Please send those to Scott Goodell and he will get them to the right person.
857	I believe ENA should be paying all those bills effective 1/1/2000.

860	I would love to take a tour.
860	I'm tied up with a family illness for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.
860	Great Idea though.
861	Thanks for pointing this out.
861	To my knowledge we have never even tried to overlap the contract or do any segmenting.
861	Enron North America Corp.
862	I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora on the National Fuel deal.
862	After adjusting for what we took out today, we owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.
862	Here are the points that I believe will work best Tenn/Colden (meter #060003) Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply.
862	Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072) Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG.
862	Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost.
863	Hey buddy, can you just send me $20.00???
863	I won't be around for the happy hour.
864	As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity contracts effective 9/1/2000.
864	I don't think we should make any changes to the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.
864	However, we will need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in Sitara.
864	Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand contracts effective 9/1/2000.

867	We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.
867	Clinton (Latrove) should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.
867	The Power Gas Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 30th and then we will be out of the local production business.
867	We've tried to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it.
867	Sorry.
868	Steve, would you take care of this please?
868	thanks
869	OK.
869	Different now.

875	And all contracts should now have an East and a Market East deal.
876	Hey Doug, I'm back in the office for awhile.
876	Let me know if you still have questions.
877	How's this??
878	IT WORKS!!!
879	Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.
879	We should have billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.
879	We will get that fixed.
880	OK.
880	When accounting did their initial draft for June production, we had a volume of 1,089,120 on deal ticket 268094.
880	Today, this same deal ticket has a volume of 497,015.
880	I think this was loaded back from Unify.
880	Can we get that fixed?
881	Miss me?
881	Apparently not - no hugs from you.
881	Who is doing my Market area stuff and why didn't Alicia tell me she was leaving??

885	I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well (other than the price).
885	I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the deal.
885	You have not sold it to anyone have you?
885	If not, I'm going to try to sell it to EES for the term.
885	And if I remember correctly, the volume is 10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?
886	I didn't buy it yet.
886	But I going to take a serious look at it.
887	Hi gang.
887	Please read the following and let me know what you think.
887	Also, what would be the best way to handle this.
888	I'm not above groveling for affection.
889	Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.
889	The CES storage balance as of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).
889	The actual sale to CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and monthly activity.
889	If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the beginning balance.
889	There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.
889	To correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on April 30th was 13%.
889	Let me know if you have questions.
890	AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 ( a difference of 26dt's).
891	Angie, would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551.
891	Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction.
892	Thanks.
892	This all started last November - where did the time go??
893	Hi Team.
893	I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.
893	Effective September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.
893	All existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara.
893	If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to "The New Power Company".
893	Thanks
894	Please take a look at deal 372088.
894	Its a new deal that starts Sep 1st and it was entered in sitara on Aug 21st.
894	I changed the counterparty from CES to New Power.
895	I think I see whats happening.
895	I believe deal 372088 is a bookout with deals 229344 and 229357.
895	Should it also be a bookout with deal 227882?
895	What about deals 169036and 217764?
895	What about dea
896	Let me know if you have any questions.
897	Perfect.
897	I will buy you one free coke!!
898	Good job Chris.
898	My contact at Iroq is out of the office.
898	When she gets back, I will agree to pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.
898	Let me know what would be the best way to enter this in Sitara.
898	I think she is back in the office next week.
898	I also think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.
898	However, she may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.
898	Comments?
899	Chic-fil-a???
899	No problem 4,053,906 sounds good.
900	On September 26-28, Temmessee is doing work at the Lockport compressor station, which is accross the river from Transcanada.
900	This work will impact the amount of gas Nat Fuel can receive from TCPL at Niagara.
900	Max capacity is around 429,000 dth.
900	During the work, the estimated capacity wil be 300,000 dth.
900	Nat Fuel will have to cut firm shippers.
901	Some questions about the 1st.
901	Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.
901	You are showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.
901	AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.
901	Is this to reduce the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?
902	Jeff, welcome to the club.
902	We are going to send you, Ora Ash, Jeff Davis, and Cindy McGinnis some goodies.
902	You, Ora, and Jeff will get Enron shirts.
902	Cindy gets a jacket.
902	Don't try selling this stuff on the street, OK?
902	I will be checking to make sure you pass the "goodies" on.
903	Please send the CNG stuff to Jeffrey Keister Dominion Transmission, Inc. 445 West Main Street.

905	We may be carrying some of our NFUL payback balance into September.
905	The firm portion of the contract will terminate on 8/31/2000.
905	However, the payback part of the deal is IT and NFUL will let us carry this balance into September.
905	On the 30th, we will move our balance on deal 318682 into September.
905	NFUL will give us until September 11th to payback our balance.

908	Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.
908	Take a look at my worksheet.
908	All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale.
908	Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.
908	What about deal 202939?
908	Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very confusing the way I do it.
909	The Power Gas Marketing supply for Sep is 3,000 DTH.
910	Hey woman, how much vacation do I have left BEFORE i fill out a timesheet for the 2nd part of August?
911	I copied deal 226703 to 380492 for Sep forward and changed the counterparty to New Power.
911	Robert, The volumes for deal 380492 are included in the FOM citygate sale.
912	According to my Mr. Scott Goodell, deal 231667 is a true sale to CES for Allied Signal.
912	This deal just goes away on Oct 1st.
913	I going with Suzanne Christensen and someone else and I going dressed just like I am, although I feel just a tad underdressed.
914	Kimat, I copied Sep forward on deal 202939 to deal 380571 and changed the counterparty to new power.
915	Scott Hendrickson sold the 10,000 month of Power Gas Marketing supply behind East Ohio to EES (deal 380671) for the term of the deal.

917	We can't do anything until the end of September.
917	Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday morning and be appointed executor.
917	She said there needs to be 2 witnesses ( and the sons count, so does Mary) to testify that the signature on the will is Dad's.
918	Boo!
918	Mary's address is Rt 1 Box 315
919	I changed the demand charge for Equitrans k#270 on the Aug and Sep worksheet.
919	Would you let me know what the capacity deal tickets are and I will change Sitara as well.
919	thanks
920	Kimat, I think either 226553 or 372096 + 227882 should be taken to 0 for September.
920	I'm taking deal 226553 to 0 for now.

923	Joanne, I made a change to Aug 31st.
923	Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.
923	Let me know if anyone has questions.
924	Colleen, we still show the 1,000 dt/day of Equitrans capacity on our CES (now New Power) sheet.
924	Do you know if CES ever agreed to take this contract?
925	Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend.
925	I adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.
925	We will inject 31,463 on the 1st, and 31454 on the 2nd-5th.
925	Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th.
926	The PPL contract number for September is 523489, volume= 2,400.

927	Hold me back.
927	I feel the excitement.
927	Just kidding, hope your day is full of wonders!!!
928	Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect.
928	Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss how to correctly handle this in our system.
928	We also have some other supply behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly.
928	Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East Ohio???
928	Any others?
928	People I need in attendance Mary Theresa or Jeanne Steve Gillespie Angie Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group) This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet.
928	I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the deals to this new pipeline.

928	I need you to go into escript (Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this system.

931	I think me flying back on 18th or 19th will be ok.
931	I'll verify afternoon lunch and call you.
932	Im doing gooooood!
932	I got crackers!
933	Please call Damon Sykes at National Fuel 716-857-6847.
933	He would like to talk about a park & loan deal involving Transcanada.
934	Anyone interested??
934	Read below
935	I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday, 19th.
935	It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable.
935	Sounds good to me.
935	I told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and just get my money back for the one I don't use.
935	I would buy one leaving Monday evening and the one for Tuesday morning COOL, don't you think?
936	Shipper Meeting
937	I thought I would sleep in the car, or maybe a shelter.
938	You need to give me a boottle in a brown bag.
939	I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.
939	If we no longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies.
939	What do you think?
940	We have a new Transco 6-6 contract.
940	Del Mainline BG&E #7221 (Non New York) Please enter this on the morning sheet.
940	Thanks
941	Opps.
941	I made an error.
941	This is a Sep 2000 contract.
941	I changed the term on
942	With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying.
942	Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.
942	I would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the delivery points.
942	I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the month.
942	Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract.
942	But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it and I am unable to verify the information myself.
942	It could have a big impact on what we flow in Z6.
942	Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?
942	Let me know if you need specific capacity examples.
943	I'm all over it.
943	I have 2 plane tickets, one for Monday evening, the 18th, at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning, 19th, at 6:45am.
943	Knowing what a wonderfull morning person you are, I will probably leave Monday evening.
943	AND I will be in town next weekend.
943	Who is giving you a pool party??
944	I'm looking for an invoice from El Paso Field Services for July 2000 production.
944	The rate should be $.05 and the volume should be around 37,000.
944	Have you seen such a thing?
945	What are deal tickets 299159 and 299192?
946	I changed deals 268090 and 268093 effective 9/7/2000.
946	We plan to have storage maxed out by 9/30/2000 and there will be no injections for October.
946	Comments, questions??
946	Will this cause any problems with the Choice program in October?
947	I'm there!
948	You are funny.
948	I laughed for 5 min when I saw this.
949	I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.
949	It has very big volumes on it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.
949	Joanne just verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.
949	This will be a big OA variance for June - August.
949	This deal is for deliveries to Storage.
949	Would you verify if ACA and GRI are billed for storage deliveries please?
950	You changed the rate on this deal from $.0227 to $.0358 effective 8/5/00.
950	What's up with that girl?
951	SST and we always assume we are using FTS.
952	I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.
952	Before the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.
952	After the change its (CGAS - $.30)x(1-.0492).
952	This widens the spread by about $.24.
953	I justed asked dick, vickie is taking over Dan's job.
953	Does that mean transport???
953	EOL???
953	dick doesn't know.
954	This impacts the following deals in Sitara, Deal 222734 - purchase from Alliance Deal 265943 - purchase from Meng Deal 227992 - transport usage
955	Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion Project.
955	Bids are due Thursday, Sep 29th.
955	Momentum is expected to be in service by 5/1/2003.
955	Shippers can elect the following receipt points, St 65, St 85, or Destin.
955	The primary delivery point is St 165.
955	The minimum term is 15 years.
955	I will still be here doing transport.
956	Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.
956	Example: See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.
956	I was concerned that we would double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on the Physical Forward sale as well.
957	I was going to send you a photo of your woman from the baby shower but I can't load it from work.
957	I'll send it to you next week.

965	We are at a $5.44 in storage on CGAS.
965	I don't think I can give you anything on CNG but I'm still checking.
965	Just assume I can't and I call you if I find something.
965	The screen went up $.20 today.
966	I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091.
966	I wonder if there should be an Internal demand charge for $.09?
967	I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.
967	This is a Market East desk deal.
967	I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept having problems saving the deal so I created a new one.
967	Let me know if this works.
968	I killed deal 396265 and added the demand charge to deal 124109.
969	Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.
969	In this example, we were notified 1 month after the effective flow date.
969	Comments?
969	Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk.
969	Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity.

978	Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August.

980	I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.
980	Dan will be out Monday but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore.
980	Judy is out in the afternoons.
980	So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.
980	Vickie's role has not been fully explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow.
981	I added Meredith's photo to the web page below last night.
982	I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.
982	He said we have positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS contract, and we have a balance of (797,163) on our ISS.
982	It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.
982	Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we need to take out the 301 dt.
982	Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling this please?
982	Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.
982	Thanks
983	However, I will be flying out of Baltimore Monday morning and I'll be dressing business causal.
983	I'm leaving tonight.
984	Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.
984	The FSS balance is 797,464 and the ISS balance is (797,771).
984	This is better.
984	We need to pay back another 307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.
984	I know you guys will make me proud.
985	Dick, use this worksheet to calculate NIPSCO's price.
985	Scott, Dick may have you look at this.
985	The prices in Column H are for capacity demand charges.
986	According to Brenda we owe Egan 101 dts (per Egan's statement) on the expired Egan storage contract.
986	Jesse, would you verify this with Egan and find out what they want to do?

1001	AND are these volumes MCF's or MMBTU's?
1001	AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?
1002	Russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in Sitara before the agency contract is in Global.
1002	That makes things quicker for Scott and I.
1003	I sold the Niagara/Nat Fuel back to the Central Desk for the rest of the month.
1003	Please take the 16,500 dt of Trco Z6 to Z6 space to 0 in Sitara for the balance of the month.

1004	When did Bay State bill ENA for this?

1004	It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09.

1022	I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara; Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.
1022	Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).
1022	Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?
1022	I think every time I create a VNG deal, a confirm is faxed to them.
1022	AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as production area sales), please let me know.
1022	The easiest way I can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet.
1023	Correction deal 418015 is really 418051.

1033	Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.
1033	I may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables are netting to 0.
1033	For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment to Clinton.
1033	Paul, let me know if you have questions.
1033	For July, the imbalance is actually in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.
1033	For August forward, I believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.
1033	Let me know if you want to make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these deals to go away.
1033	Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

1061	I should have an idea by this Wed.
1062	Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical?
1063	I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".
1063	Acually since we don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify.
1064	We need to confirm all the data on Mark's worksheet.
1064	Let me know if you have any questions.
1065	I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together somehow.
1065	I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk.
1065	Let me know what you guys think.
1065	I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob Supperty about this,.

1073	Please path these deals in Unify.
1073	Thanks
1074	Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.
1074	Following are the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000 Contract MDQ Delivery Point Demand Comm Comment 47 16,373 S Webster $6.0800 $.0500 Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes below 4,723 per day.
1074	Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.
1074	Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.
1074	Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October?
1074	Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities?
1075	Please redraft the New Power September activity.
1075	I'm looking for the deals shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811.
1075	If you see the items above, please send me a new worksheet.
1075	Thanks
1076	Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.
1076	I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.
1076	David and I discussed this.
1076	Let me know if you have any questions.
1076	Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, everything should be billed through the system.
1077	I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format.
1078	I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink.
1078	Oh yea, you already did!
1078	Enron North America Corp.
1079	Nuthin I want to put in writing.
1080	We are missing 2 deals, 433359 (sale) and 433385 (purchase).
1080	Please redraft and let me know if you see these.
1081	Oh now you're teasing me!
1081	I went riding last night.
1081	I think I need some winter motorcycle gear.
1081	My brother and I are taking a biking trip in November - don't know where we are going yet.
1081	How's the new job?
1081	What do you do with yourself in the evenings now?
1082	I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better winter riding gear.
1082	We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.
1082	All we are doing is verifying Dad's signature on the will.
1082	Once the judge sees us it should only take about five minutes.
1082	That's all I have for now.
1083	I'm having a problem sending this to Don.
1083	What is eamil?
1084	Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September.
1084	These are the deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep. Would you check on them and let me know what you find out?
1085	I spoke with Rich yesterday.
1085	He said it would be OK to net the storage true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.
1085	I mailed the invoice via interoffice to Jeff.
1085	There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably be billed to New Power.
1085	All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.
1085	How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?
1085	Rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
1086	Please forward to Don, my email is not going through.
1087	I will be out the week of the 13th.
1088	Cute, I want one!!
1089	Did you call me?
1089	I have a message from Mike at 3-5480.
1089	It ain't your voice on voicemail.
1090	ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.
1090	I believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.
1090	ENA released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract.
1090	It was a citygate sale in New York and we wanted to transfer title at the pool.
1090	I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.
1090	He is terminating the agency.
1091	If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from someone else.
1091	The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.
1091	And this was the only time we ever used the agency on CNG.
1092	I didn't go to the shipper meeting.
1092	We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy that works for us now.
1092	You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back when.
1092	He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.
1092	My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.
1092	No new news - I hope to find out more next week.
1092	Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!
1092	Tell Muffy I said hi!
1093	I think everyone needs a good wife!
1094	Let me know the deal # after you enter it in Sitara.
1094	Thanks
1095	I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.
1095	Could you email me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August?
1096	James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.
1096	I don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.
1096	He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.
1096	The demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.
1096	This is what we know about the contract: The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted commodity of $.05 and discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61 What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day.
1096	What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day for November -
1097	I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form.
1097	Jerry, please forward to Don, I couldn't email him the other day.
1098	I just called Lincoln Life - Dad's mutual fund.
1098	He will mail me the forms to fill out today.
1099	Give me a copy of the invoice.
1099	thanks
1100	hey you, everything is still the same but here they are just as a double check Zone Comm Fuel
1101	Please send me the August invoice for CES.
1101	Did we do any manual billings for August?
1101	I need those too.
1102	Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ?
1103	Come chat with me when you get a chance.
1103	I see you are not at your desk, as usual.
1104	No can do on lunch next week.
1104	How about after work at that little Italian place (i think) close to St Thomas High School?
1104	We talked about this place before
1105	5.215 by 5.225, I bought 5.235, thought it was going up
1106	Judy bought some new capacity on TRCO Rec St 62 Delivery St 65
1107	You're on!
1108	CGAS storage looks good.
1108	We are still working on the ohters.
1108	I should have a better feel by tomorrow afternoon.
1109	Call me when you get a chance.
1109	There is some new capacity to execute for November.
1109	Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown in yellow.
1109	Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.
1109	I won't execute these until I hear from you.
1109	The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.
1109	Scott said Jeff gave us the OK on this one.
1110	Opps.
1110	You don't work for CES anymore.
1111	You are correct.
1111	The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one is released to ENA.
1111	I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's contracts to ENA.
1112	I meant the top 4 contracts
1113	I know, tell all the women you know.
1114	Are you guys looking for people?
1114	I have a call from an ex KN Energy lady looking for a job.
1114	Name Sharon Dale Beavers Phone 281-397-85285 Let me know.
1115	Correction on the 4,018 dth from CPA (offer #30496), the receipt point is Broad Run, not Leach.
1116	I changed the end date on CGLF k#42789 (deal 156388) to 10/31/2001.
1117	I changed the end term date on cglf k#50250 from 10/31/2000 to 7/31/2001.
1118	I need to check this one.
1118	We have several contracts with evergreen clauses.
1118	I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did.
1119	Call me buddy.
1119	Ingrid wants to come over and do a dog and pony show about Transco's new ??system??
1119	I think.
1119	AND I suggested she meet with EES and ENA at the same time.
1119	I'm thinking around the 1st week in November.
1119	What do you think?
1120	Run facilitation by location reports for November 1st for Columbia Energy Services ???(Inc I think) and The New Power Company and Enron Energy Services, Inc. thanks
1121	We both ran out of gas.
1121	I just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when I did it.
1121	That was the first time we went by the skydive place.
1122	CNG has new commodity rates effective 11/1/2000 New Old Fuel remains unchanged at 2.28%.
1123	Update, Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers.
1123	We hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers.
1124	Update.
1124	Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.
1124	We can't buy Don out right now.
1124	We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary (be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.
1124	She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.
1124	After we provide the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.
1124	Joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.
1124	I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.
1124	Do you care?
1124	I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.
1124	Hope for the best!!
1124	Later
1125	Kim, please forward to the traders.
1125	I think the schedulers have this already.
1125	Please forward: Room Change
1126	Did everyone see this?
1127	I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator.
1127	Take a look and let me know what you think.
1127	Also, do you know the demand charges for the CGAS items highlighted in purple?
1128	Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe.
1128	I attached September, is this the month you are looking for?
1129	Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team.
1129	I would like to have that please.
1129	I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in November.
1129	thanks
1130	Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + .0075 for 10,000 dth day starting on the 27th.
1130	New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla.
1131	Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third Party" buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.
1131	Not a big deal for October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months.
1131	I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.
1131	Example: You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.
1131	ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.
1131	We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet.
1131	So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.
1131	Comments?
1132	The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.
1132	I'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.
1132	ENA billed CES (now New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.
1132	Now ENA needs to pay New Power for the gas taken out of storage.
1132	In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000.
1132	Take a look - let me know if you have any comments.
1133	Sean may want to go to this.
1134	I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.
1134	Est Citygate for Nov 43,213 Storage Withdrawal 15,000 Net Purchase from ENA 28,213 Does this look correct?
1134	We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).
1134	AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are maintaining.
1134	Do you want to try and do away with any of them?
1134	All I really need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone.
1135	Done deal 454150
1136	Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP, and his number is 614-324-5038.
1136	Scott is THE MAN!
1137	I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.
1137	ENA inherited this deal from CES.
1137	This is a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.
1137	I entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments.
1137	P.S.
1137	Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra.
1138	Remember the Titans!!!!!!!!!!!
1139	Who's gonna pay for my popcorn?
1139	Did you like that pumpkin?
1140	Hey team.
1140	I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New Power) at the pool.
1140	This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.
1140	I'm using the following FOM numbers 7th-26th 41,762 New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through the 25th.
1140	Not as much as I thought.
1141	We should have some impact from the following deals 456630, 456638, and I increased the price on 414075.
1142	YES WE ARE!!
1143	We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226.
1143	This is back on a month to month basis.
1143	We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet.
1144	Contract MDQ
1145	FLARE IT!!
1146	Marlene, please call Beverly at 713-853-6357 when you get this contract set up.
1146	Thanks
1147	What volumes do we have for Power Gas Marketing and for the sale to Clinton?
1147	AND what has Clinton agreed to pay us?
1147	What is the deal number for the sale to Clinton?
1148	What are the winning lotto numbers for Wed night?
1149	What are women really looking for in life?
1150	When do you take the bike to the shop?
1150	I have your key on my keyring.
1151	I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New Power).
1151	I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing.
1151	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1152	I just entered the CES demand charges for August on the following deals Deal 343896 - East demand charges of $655,443 Deal 231667 - Market East demand charges of $881,995 Thank you Melba
1153	You De Man!
1154	I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy.
1155	Just send cookies then and we will be happy.
1156	I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on CGAS.
1156	I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.
1156	He does not have a navigator ID and password.
1156	This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he has not bought any gas for Nov either.
1156	I think he needs someone to handle this for him.
1156	Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES?
1157	I need to look and see what I have.
1157	But first, you are not going with some boys are you???
1157	I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry.
1157	Do you need fishing stuff?
1158	Yes - a small one.
1158	So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have fishing stuff too.
1158	Where are you going camping.
1159	I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you can use.
1159	I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though.
1160	We have a volumetric contract on Texas Gas and I'm not sure how to enter it in Sitara.
1160	The volumetric demand charge is $.005, deal #461568
1161	Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.
1161	Dick and I will be chatting about this later today.
1161	Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard about it.
1162	I brought in my backback, 2 flashlights, and a small cooler type thing.
1162	They are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk.
1162	Come take a look when you get a chance.
1163	I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk.
1163	The backpack is dark blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it.
1163	There is a yellow cooler inside and 2 flashlights.
1164	I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st.
1164	Please take all other volumes on these deals to 0.
1164	Thanks
1165	Have I told you how wonderful you are?
1165	I actually the Gas Daily prices for every day.
1165	If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull.
1166	Let's chat about CNG retail storage on Monday
1167	I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract for Nov-Mar.
1167	We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end effective March 31, 2001.
1167	The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.
1167	I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563 Buy exchange 470582 Sell Cpr Storage 470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through March 31.
1167	I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.
1168	I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release.
1168	I'm here for you - NOT.
1168	Enron North America Corp.
1169	I added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that I feel we will be using most on EOL.
1169	Let me know if you have any questions.
1170	I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.
1170	please let me know when you validate these or what else you need.
1170	Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.
1170	Did this have a big p&l impact?
1170	My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF.
1171	We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas and CGLF.
1171	We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.
1171	I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.
1171	Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.
1171	I am currently using a CPR Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.
1171	I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day.
1172	Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following deal tickets Deal Comment 470563 New Power Exchange buy 470568 New Power Exchange sell 470582 CPR Storage Sell 470587 CPR Storage Buy We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st.
1172	Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in Sitara.
1172	Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions.
1173	I can't see what you have in the 5th column.
1173	Buy, if the all meters on the pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know.
1174	Great, exactly what I needed.
1175	Have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?
1175	Deal contract
1176	Use "Sheet 3" on the attached file.
1176	Page me at 1-800-978-1788 if you have questions.
1177	I did vote for the new sports arena.
1177	AND, I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today.
1177	I will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input.
1178	I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the following deals.
1178	Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.
1178	Deal Comment 473178 Exchange sell for the November Injections 473190 Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.
1178	Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.
1178	Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.
1178	Please set up the Egan to Texas Gas ticket.
1178	All of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested.
1179	Look again and let me know.
1179	I had problems seeing the volumes at first, THEN I opend my eyes.
1179	Makes a world of difference!
1180	Commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into Texas Gas.
1180	thanks cg
1181	I know it, you know it, who's telling all the single women??
1182	Please transfer the storage balance of 420 dth from contract 530750 to VNG contract 300008.
1182	Thanks
1183	My Tetco schedulers have not gotten back to me on whether we have shipped gas on these contracts.
1183	I'll try to check that myself today.
1184	Don't worry about getting me a Diet Coke.
1184	I just got one.
1185	I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index pricing.
1185	Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate sale to you, also at the FOM price.
1185	Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and enter the deals.
1185	Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power for the 10th-30th at $5.68.
1185	I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to incorporate it into my citygate pricing.
1185	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1186	Nov 1st.
1186	Enron North America Corp.
1187	I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well.
1187	I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?
1187	We don't have that much activity on this contract.
1187	Let me know.
1188	I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec. I think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault.
1189	What Chics will be there - and you don't count.
1190	Hey, you're back.
1190	Did you have fun?
1190	jerry and I are taking a motorcycle trip next week.
1191	Thanks for the post card.
1192	National Fuel Gas Supply is having a Customer Information and Procedures Meeting on Thursday, Dec 7th, at the Marriott West Loop by the Galleria.
1192	The meeting starts at 9:00 am and will probably last to mid-afternoon.
1192	I'm going.
1192	I don't know if anyone else needs to go - Algonso maybe.
1193	Your camera takes good photo's.
1193	We are going to the timeshare at Canyon Lake.
1193	Remember, they had the pig and it sleep with Chad and Chance.
1193	We are trailering the motorcycles up there and we are going to take day trips around that area from the time share.
1193	We have the timeshare Mon-Thur or Fri.
1193	Then we are going to Dad's for a night or two.
1194	I just created deals 480324 and 480325 on CGAS for Oct 31st.
1194	I missed these.
1194	Please path them in Unify.
1194	Thanks
1195	Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.
1195	Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.
1195	I'll explain it to you when I get back.
1195	On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price on the big citygate deal.
1196	Alfonso, you are off the hook.
1197	Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.
1197	I spot checked some of the deals and they look good to me.
1197	There are 2 small deals that are missing, deals 480324 and 480325.
1197	These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX purchase.
1197	I had the buy/sale on CGLF.
1197	I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS until this afternoon.
1197	Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next week.
1197	The dollar impact should be very small.
1197	Remember, I'm out next week.
1198	Now that's funny!
1199	I missed you too.
1200	I LOVE MY SWEATS!
1201	I can't remember, should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and Market East?
1202	I deleted 2 meters from deal 418282 for 12/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.
1202	Please make sure the risk assignment is still ok.
1202	Thanks
1203	Sorry Emily.
1203	I usually just type "ALLW" to get Robert.
1204	Call Me
1205	I don't know if this meeting is still on.
1205	I'll let you know.
1206	We drinking beer tonight?

1207	I went home with every intention of coming back last nite!!
1207	So what if I didn't!
1208	Use Audrey as your contact now.
1208	Her number is 713-853-4317.
1209	I believe this works.
1209	I'm entering all sales to New Power at Broad Run on deal 498019.
1209	I created a purchase deal 498022 priced at FOM Index price.
1209	We should bookout these two deals.
1209	The delivery to the citygate should be on the big FOM deal ticket comingled with everything else.
1209	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1210	I don't have any of the contract information.
1210	I will have to get the info, get Marlene to set these up in global contracts and then set them up in unify.
1210	It probably won't happen today.
1210	I'll keep you posted.
1211	I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.
1211	I entered this as a Dec-00 deal.
1211	The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.
1211	My fault.
1211	I corrected Sitara.
1212	I know you don't believe this but I am working on a notional offer.
1213	Man what a busy day.
1213	I guess Ingrid is ok.
1213	I have not spoke to her for awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think.
1213	I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day, then going to my Dad's place this weekend.
1213	What are you doing?
1214	Would you get me all the contract details on this capacity and email it to me?
1214	thanks

1216	To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.
1216	Do you have a contact at Statoil?
1216	I can call and try to get more info.
1216	It could be some CES thing we were not aware of.
1217	I think this is correct.
1217	We will show it this way for now.
1217	Can you verify what were billed in demand for Oct please.
1217	No rush.,
1218	Matched TRCO bid.

1228	The transport contract has been amended and the only 2 receipt points on the contract are Mamou and Henry.

1232	ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume parked.
1232	These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.
1232	Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).
1232	Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you have questions.
1232	Thanks

1238	The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.
1238	Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.
1238	Tetco doesn't know how this gas flows.
1238	They are still checking into this one.
1238	It may actually flow into CNG., Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.
1238	This gas is a backhaul to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.
1238	The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.
1239	I have an appointment to get fitted for a suit tonite and then I;m going drinkin after that.
1239	Is it ok we leave tomorrow?
1240	Steve, please add Victor and myself to your email distribution.

1241	I won't be here tomorrow but I found an error on the New Power deals I entered yesterday.
1241	Deal Previous Vol & Rate Current Vol & Rate P&L Impact Net Impact $495,000
1242	We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.
1242	The deal number is 418282.
1242	Could we put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet?
1242	We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.
1242	We need to call Bay State if we move it.
1242	My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.
1242	I gave Stacey Angie's number as a contact.
1242	If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to Robin.
1243	According to Kimat this is flash to actual stuff now.
1243	I made these adjustments today for Nov 30th.
1243	Joann, Alvin, the deals listed below are bookouts.
1244	I'm having trouble getting off.
1244	What time is the flight out on the 29th - that's my trouble day, the latter the better so I can be here in the morining.
1245	I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.
1245	Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.
1245	thanks
1246	My worked.
1246	How many times a week did you put down?
1247	What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today?
1248	I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..
1248	I though you might be asleep.
1249	We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor.
1250	Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff??
1250	What numbers should I be using now, FOM number, Volume sold back at Index Flat?
1250	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1251	Ms. Arnold called looking for the IF today.
1251	She gets a much better response out of me than you do.
1252	The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.
1252	I created the deal with 0 volumes.
1253	ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.
1253	This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.
1253	I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.
1253	Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.
1253	I believe its in the deal correctly.
1253	Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that.
1253	This deal goes thru 2/28/01.
1254	Call me Hussy!
1254	I got questions.
1255	Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.
1255	Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 (in New Jersey).
1255	This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.
1255	Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.
1255	The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle.
1255	E Town N Jersey Con Ed Bug Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco) Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin) Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.
1255	Also, deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.
1255	Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.
1255	Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville.
1256	I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.
1256	Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out.
1256	But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make.
1256	I humbly accept my position.
1257	I love my sweats.
1257	Hows muffy?
1258	Sorry about that.
1258	Gotta go to a meeting.
1258	Give Muffy a hug for me.
1259	I'll be winning the lotto soon.
1259	Nice knowin ya!
1260	Oh be still my aching heart, filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff) I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!!
1261	There is a demand charge of $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.
1261	I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.
1261	This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal.
1261	I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000 for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal.
1261	We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.
1261	There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month.
1261	Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?
1261	Thanks
1262	I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry.
1262	Don, do you have a fax number I could send it too?
1263	Type Comm Fuel Total at $8.70 Diff .1467
1264	Probably.
1265	Hi.
1265	I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.
1265	Should I let someone in your office know about that?
1266	Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity?
1267	This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.
1267	Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco mainline.
1267	What do you think?
1267	I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco.
1267	It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St
1268	Why did you go to power?
1268	Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I made back in 1994??
1269	Hey Team!
1269	This email is just an FYI for you guys.
1269	I don't expect you to see anything until January.
1270	Early morning, right?
1270	I want to be rested for the big party.
1271	Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production?
1271	According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to the bill.
1271	He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might have been some Michcon activity missing.
1272	You make it sound like you are going away for good.
1272	I'll see you when you come back.
1273	What happened to all my emails?
1273	How's my Duff?
1273	What's going on?
1274	Call me, we want the backhaul contract
1275	We have a new backhual contract from Transco.
1275	Demand $.07 Volume 5,000 Rec Zone 6 Del Zone 1 I just set this up in Sitara.
1275	Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon.
1275	Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.
1275	We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle.
1276	Dick has this in at a $6.89, I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the Jeffrey Porter@EES
1277	Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset Management" deal.
1277	Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred Deal Vol Price Comment 516083 10000 8.00 sell to NP for the 5th at the pool 521475 20000 8.28 sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP.

1278	Let me know when you want to chat about NYPA.
1278	It should only take about 15 min.
1278	I would like Beverly present because someday I would like to be agent for NYPA on their contract.
1279	I entered 3 deals that I do not want included in the P&L tonight.
1279	They are all purchases from New Power Deals
1280	New Power purchased A06 gas from ENA.
1280	Please bookout dealsl 521753 (sale to New Power) with 521780 (purchase from New Power).
1281	ENA purchased 11.000 dth from New Power at IF flat (deal 509454).

1283	I have a 1995 Yamaha Virago 1100.
1283	I like it.
1283	I got a tattoo of a heart with your name inside it.
1284	I just changed the volume from 11000 to 11316 per day for the whole month.
1285	We cooked that sucker at Thanksgiving.
1285	Not much meat either.
1286	I'm RSVPing and I don't have a date.
1286	What are you doing?
1287	This is what I show for the 1st 5 days.
1287	We are off about 552 dth on the 2nd and the 3rd, all the other numbers seem close enough.
1287	I had an error in my formula.
1287	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1288	Can you find me a woman?
1288	You know I'm still sorta single.
1289	This was the last notice about IT capacity on Transco.

1290	Meredith wants a compact cd holder for her car for Christmas.
1291	I just purchased 35000 day for Sat, Sun and Mon from New Power (deal 525128) at $8.40.
1291	Bookout with deal 525121 (sale at IF + .0125).
1292	I will be updating deals 523459 and 523444.
1292	This is a bookout.
1292	I have these deals updated through the 5th
1293	Have fun.
1293	Gas prices are going through the roof
1294	I need to hold the New Power invoice until Monday.
1294	It should be ready to send out Monday afternoon and everything should be captured in Sitara.
1295	I must have deleted the GRI memo I had.
1295	Sorry about that.
1296	I need a volunteer.
1296	The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New Power deals in the market area.
1296	99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.
1296	Who wants it?
1296	Certain people have expressed an interest in learning more about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly Beaty.
1296	I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 4-6 hours during bidweek.
1296	I also believe this deal will go away effective Pros Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing guru like myself.
1296	Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
1296	May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing.
1296	Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con) Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&L.
1296	Cons Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
1296	May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.
1296	I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
1296	I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm very detail oriented.
1296	I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the job very serious.
1297	opened $9.50 by $9.60 now $9.25 by $9.35
1298	I need a Destin class.
1298	The only think I know about Destin is that its a Transco Z4 Mainline Point.
1299	TP #6562, North Carolina Nat Gas, is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool.
1299	TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville.
1299	This point is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool.
1299	The meter number for Public Serv.
1299	NC is TP #6608, and this is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool.
1300	That means you didn't send me the attachment.
1300	OR if you did, I don't see it.
1301	Would you send me the purchases?
1301	thanks
1302	Looks good with the following changes.
1302	If you see these changes come through then its good to go.
1302	Thanks The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891.
1302	Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571.
1303	call me
1304	We a conference room big enough for 8 people on Thursday, Nov 14 at 3:00 PM.
1304	Vickie, I will see if the meeting date can be changed if Dan calls.
1305	Date correction, Dec 14, not Nov 14.
1306	Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.
1306	VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.
1306	Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time.
1306	During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the capacity.
1306	Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the capacity non-biddable.
1306	I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me.
1306	Dick suggested I tell you.
1306	TAGG - you're it, I will await your command.
1306	Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec.
1307	Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of November.
1307	The invoices are on their way, I think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel.
1307	Let me know if you have any questions.
1308	Do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following Columbia Energy Services contracts
1309	NEWS FLASH!!!!
1309	The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas.
1309	The Court ruling is not based on the seperation of Church and State Simply put, the Court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol.
1309	However, finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.
1310	I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy Marketing on several pipelines.
1310	Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) last day is this Friday.
1310	I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.
1310	As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and liability) relationships.
1311	Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?
1311	I am still estimating about $5,000 per month.
1312	I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to $1,194,758.
1312	This is on deal 508891.
1312	Would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to New Power?
1312	Thanks My fault for not correcting it sooner.
1313	My fault.
1313	Try it again.
1313	I just released the deal.
1314	We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.
1314	We will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.
1314	The lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose.
1315	I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.
1315	This is a bookout.
1315	The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't then I goofed.
1316	I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.
1316	I don't think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this deal ticket.
1316	Let me know if there are any problems.
1316	This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month scheduling fee.
1316	We are still working on the East demand charges for New Power.
1317	Found it.
1318	The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the New Power Market Area.
1318	We are still working on the East demand charges, they are not correct.
1318	I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sales deal.
1319	Nothing new to report.
1319	I received an official copy of the inventory list last night.
1319	I will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer today.
1320	Welcome Volunteers!!
1320	Beavy, since you are going to be out, and most of our work will be done next week, I will start giving Tricia "to do's" and you can catch up later.
1320	I have a meeting at 3:00 PM today.
1320	I would like to give you both a quick 15 min preview before then if possible.
1320	Let me know.
1320	Tricia, Please run a "monthly facilitaion by location" report for "The New Power Company" for both MarketEast and East for Jan 2001 and Jan-Dec 2001.
1320	I don't know if you can run the Jan-Dec 2001 on one report.
1320	Tricia, if we do the 15 min meeting today, I would like to have 3 copies of the Jan 2001 facilitation.
1320	I create a ton of bookout deals for New Power and I always start with the CPR report.
1320	Thanks.
1321	For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.
1321	Effective 12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.
1321	I made the following adjustments to deal 473190, took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31 extended the deal to Jan 2001 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444 This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 1500 day in Jan. Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.
1321	I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13) plus 48025 ) at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.
1321	Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.
1321	This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.
1321	No big deal, I just want to make sure we don't leave any gas in parking.
1322	I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following.
1322	Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 (volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st).
1322	Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 (volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st).
1322	The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.
1322	This is not a bookout, One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal 516286.
1322	We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.
1322	The volume on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.
1322	Just a note, since I think the purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the month in Sitara.
1322	I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify.
1323	Take a look at my worksheet and we will go over it.
1323	It's mind boggeling.
1324	Should we release the VNG capacity to ENA effective 1/1/2001?
1324	If yes, then what time frame (one year)?
1325	Screen is 8.375 by 8.425, I'm happier!
1326	Does this work?
1326	You don't read your emails do you?Call me before 11:20 am and I'll give you a dollar.
1327	Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS.
1327	I will also try to update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes.
1327	I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals.
1327	I feel good about the NX1 volumes for Jan and Feb, I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet.
1327	I will keep working on thei sheet.
1328	I guess you and Muffy better be snuggling to stay warm.
1329	I updated the worksheet with a little more info and I added Trco and Tetco Marktet area information.
1329	I did this quickly so let me know if something doesn't look right.
1329	On Monday, we will show you a bid for the Tetco and Trco volumes.
1329	Also, the Tetco and Trco volumes are monthly and the CGAS volumes are daily.
1330	I do not see a Sitara deal ticket for Tagg #NR6345.A, a Trco Z6 sell to New Power for Mar and Apr 2001.
1331	What are you going to Chicago for?
1332	Please send all VNG transport items to Vickie but cc me as well.
1332	Thanks
1333	I created deal 536707 for this gas.
1333	This has nothing to do with the voodoo deals I do with Jeff Porter.
1333	We need to schedule this.
1334	Take a look and let me know what you think.
1334	Also, please check the volumes.
1334	ENA's bid is in yellow.
1335	I added a demand charge of $93,835 to the Oglethorpe ticket for December.
1336	That's fine.
1336	I will assume New Power is physically taking the Tetco and Trco marketarea gas unless you sell it back.
1336	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1337	Please add Tricia Spence to this email.
1337	She will be working with me on the CGAS volumes.
1337	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1338	I would like to spend 20 min with you today.
1338	I need to update my Gas Daily buy/sells for December and I would like for you to see it.
1338	It takes me about 10 min a day to do.
1339	2:00 pm at my desk then.
1340	I sold 10000 day (deal 536976) starting on the 20th at $9.15 to New Power.
1340	Please bookout this deal with 536977 (purchase at FOM index pricing).
1341	Nope.
1341	Just bring a smile.
1342	I have update the New Power tickets 523459 and523444 for the 13th-15.
1343	Does GRI go from $.0072 to $.0070 in January?
1343	And I love that outfit you are wearing.
1344	I will.
1344	I hope you got my Christmas list.
1345	18ft kenner fishing boat with a 120johnson (thats a motor not something naughty)
1346	Kimat, this is the offset to the big gain we made on CGAS last night on that one deal.
1346	I increased our sales volume on deal.
1346	502957 by 10,000dth/day starting on the 19th.
1346	Deal 502957 is a citygate, index based sale and we should show a big loss on it tonite.
1347	Suzie's working on your ICTS, it ain't working so far.
1348	Per Leah, probably won't be able to get imbalance off after Friday.
1349	I killed deal 454471.
1350	If you read this before I call you then I will make brownies and bring them in.
1351	AGA is 158, screen dropped about $12 or so, now $9.52 by 9.58 call me about
1352	I just sold David Scott 170 dth of TCO pool at $11.06 for the 22nd (deal 542442).
1352	New Power will schedule this gas out of our pool.
1352	Bottom line , this is Mikey gas which is different from Jeffy gas.
1353	I don't think we are doing anything.
1353	Dick had an idea but I didn't know what he was looking at.
1353	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1354	Cindy, take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in the pool.
1354	We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see what Dominion is producing.
1354	We will not have this gas for January.
1355	Wonderful.
1355	One more question, could you give me the meter numbers for these points?
1356	Sounds good to me.
1356	I bet this is next to the Warick??
1356	Hotel.
1357	This is the first notice from Transco regarding imbalances.
1357	Transco has not changed their IT notices since the 6th, when they closed down St 90.
1358	I changed the term on this deal ticket.
1359	We need to chat about the following VNG deals.
1360	I changed the term on deal 510007.
1360	Steve, this is CNG contract #100104 for 15225 dth day.
1360	The primary receipt point on this capaity is storage.
1360	Is this a Nov-Mar deal or is this capacity good all year?
1360	Brenda, what are the rules for setting up VNG demand charges?
1360	Also, we are releasing most (not all) of the VNG space to ENA effective 1/1/2001.
1360	Should I set up ENA - Im VNG as the primary desk for demand charges?
1361	Guess Who???
1361	Its back on my desk.
1361	How do you feel about doing a manual invoice?
1361	That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point.
1362	Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December.
1362	I went thru the capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct.
1362	Let me know if you have any questions.
1362	Also, for the 1st, I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day.
1362	This is a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas, plus the CGLF volume plus some
1363	This is where we are today on the VNG releases to ENA.
1363	All effective dates are 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2003 unless stated differently.
1363	MDQ/MSQ (Storage) CNG 200088 523667 10000 FT - to be used with Cove Point.
1363	Released CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA.
1363	According to CGAS, we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.
1363	Scott is waiting to hear from CGAS.
1363	At this point, we will not release the capacity effective for the 1st.
1363	Tenn - I do not have the new contract numbers yet.
1363	Per Tenn - Scott will send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the new ENA contracts.
1363	Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to "temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases.
1363	Since I know Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping".
1363	AND we would not know about any problems until the 31st.
1363	Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.
1363	Williams has 15,930 dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.
1363	I will release 20,000 dth to ENA.
1363	This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams.
1364	HEY!!
1364	I'm a sweet guy, modest too.
1364	Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
1364	Enron North America Corp.
1365	You are so wonderfull.
1365	Would you please get me the Transco Gas Daily St 85 prices for the following dates
1366	Here are the directions to Dennis and Janice's house Friday night.
1366	Take 45 to Galveston.
1366	You want to exit right onto FM2351.
1366	It's the next exit after Ellington AFBt.
1366	You will turn left at the second red light onto Hope Village.
1366	Clear Brook High School will be on your right after you make the turn.
1366	You will come to a Neighborhood right after the High School.
1366	Take your first right into the neighborhood.
1366	Next take the second left which is Constitution.
1366	They are a few block down on the right.
1366	15710 Constitution in Heritage Park II.
1366	Party Time is 6:00 PM.
1366	No gifts, bring a friend if you like.
1366	See you tomorrow BUB.
1367	Would you give me a copy of the deal ticket for deal 295058 please.
1368	These are the Market Volumes I have in Sitara for New Power for January and the assumptions I'm making.
1368	Pipeline Volume (daily) Point Comment CNG 4100 South Point Scheduled by New Power CGAS 4064 Pool NX1 - will bookout and include in Citygate deal 2013 Pool NX1 - will bookout and include in Citygate deal 1301 Pool From CGLF mainline, will bookout and include in Citygate deal 24301 Citygate Exhibit 1 max volume for Jan 2001.
1368	CGAS 30000 Pool IF + $.04, scheduled by New Power Tetco 215 M3 Scheduled by New Power unless sold back to ENA Trco 475 Z6 Non NY Scheduled by New Power unless sold back to ENA.
1369	Would you look at this and let me know if it looks ok.
1369	I'm going to send this to Willie after I get your approval.
1369	My economic folks just gave me the Gas Daily prices.
1370	Since we are selling deliverd gas, the Receipt and Delivery volumes should be the same.
1370	Also, we can fix it so the imbalance is 0 on the 22nd if that would be easier.
1370	Let me know buddy.
1371	According to my records, New Power has 140,099 dt's of CGAS capacity.
1371	On the 22nd, we scheduled 143,400 dt's on deal 502957.
1371	Please verify that New Power took 143,400 dt's on the 22nd, its ok, I just need to do a price adjustment.
1371	Thanks
1372	What was the volume of Jeffy gas going to Mikey?
1372	And what day did that start?
1373	That makes sense.
1373	So you really are not using any ENA space but then I need to check the overrun charges on the invoice.
1373	If its ok with you, I think I'll just wait to review the invoice before I do anything with that.
1373	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1374	I will need to see the CGAS invoices for Dec when we get them.
1374	According to New Power, we should have overrun charges.
1375	I created deal 546310 for pool sales to New Power.
1375	I currently have a daily volume fo 4250 on this deal.
1375	We should be able to move the volumes back and forth between this deal and the big citygate deal.
1375	Jeff, I will look at the volumes on our big citygate deal ticket and this one pool deal to calculate the Gas Daily pricing.
1375	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1376	I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.
1376	However, I do use meter numbers and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.
1376	Deal 241639 is (term purchase from AEC) is at this meter.
1376	And deal 511043 (ENA-Im Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.
1376	It doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set up in Sitara.
1376	Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes, * NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
1376	* Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)?
1376	* Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
1376	* Can this change take effect 1/1/2001?
1376	* If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today, I'll buy him a "pop".
1377	For January, I moved 2 deals from Trco Non NY to CGAS/WGL meter 78-30.
1377	Both deals are sales to New Power.
1377	Deal Volume Kimat, you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal has hedges.
1377	Joann & Alvin, this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice, this is a citygate sale to New Power at WGL.
1377	Dave, where are my New Power golf shirts, one for me, one for my sidekick Scott.
1378	Mr. Scott found and one of my errors.
1378	Deal 377264 is for only 470dt's per day.
1379	I created deal 547910, with a price of IF + .0125.
1380	Any news?
1381	I changed the effective date of deal 547638 from Jan-2000 to Jan-2001.
1382	Jim had a death in the family and is gone.
1382	I didn't change any of the info at the top but the invoice number should be 18719SA I think.
1383	I created a buy/sell with Hopewell that we are going to kill after the month is over.
1383	Deals 549136 and 549152 will be killed next week.
1383	These tickets are just estimating the loss on oil replacement.
1384	I am showing a balance of 80,265 in the Egan park deal as of Jan 1, 2001.
1384	Egan is showing a balance of 84,944.
1384	I am using our balance for now.
1384	I'm taking 2592 dt's in to Texas Gas for the 1st and 2nd, and 2599 dt's per day for the balance of the month.
1384	I tried to update all the deal tickets but I won't know if it worked until after our systems work.
1385	I tried to fax all 4 deal sheets at once - and the pages stuck together.
1385	So I faxed each page seperately.
1385	Nice outfit.
1385	Judy says "Hey".
1386	This is all I've seen for the 1st.
1387	This deal needs to be moved to ENA - Im Marketeast.
1388	Cancelled my trip, I'm here all day, too great a chance for NY to get a blizzard.
1389	Please recall the following GSS capacity effective 1/1/2001 - 1/31/2001.

1392	Bookout purchase deal 551053 with sales deal 547583

1393	Whew, I think thats it.
1393	Deal 551058 will need to fixed next week.
1393	I'll do if I remember.
1394	We have some volume discrepancies starting on the 23rd.

1398	Dick bought gas from Tim Ray, does this impact our stuff?
1398	Dick bought 15000 day at 9.21 from the 4th-31st.
1399	Are you and Muffy snuggleing?
1399	I was in East Texas over the New Year's and I saw snow - just enough to make the ground white with a little grass sticking up thru the snow.
1400	I have not updated the last 4 days of the month yet.
1401	We made 1 big change that will impact tonights P&L.
1401	We chanbed the volume on deal 549411 from 72,000 per day to 106,000 per day.
1401	This is and CGAS index sale.
1402	I also increase the price from $10.53 to $10.8003, that should have a bit of an impact.
1403	I changed the demand charge from $.155 to $.20 in Sitara.,
1404	I need 2 x-large shirts for Oglethorpe Power please.
1404	I am going to give them to Mr. Homco to pass on to Oglethorpe.
1405	Please send me the Oglethorpe activity in excel for Dec 2000.
1405	thanks
1406	I added meter DOMSP to deal 549660, please adjust the hedge.
1406	thanks
1407	You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime.
1407	I have gas on National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary basis.
1407	Ellwood in Op 8, Market area 35, I think.
1407	This trades around a CNG North plus.
1407	Let me know one way or another, I'm just eager to learn.
1408	Opps.
1408	I took it home to read and I think I used it to start a fire and reduce my energy cost.
1408	Would you please fax it to me at 713-646-8453?
1408	You are so wonderfull.
1409	I have 9000 day.
1409	Ellwood will be a secondary delivery point on my contract so any deal would be best efforts.
1409	I have a call in to National Fuel to find out how they do their constraints.
1409	Jeffrey Porter@EES
1410	I sold gas to New Power for today and tomorrow, deal 557800.
1410	New Power will take this gas into their pool.
1410	Date Volume Price
1411	Revised the volume to 571 on the 4th and 615 on the 5th.
1412	Dear Team, I updated the bookout deals 523459 and 523444 for the following dates, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 29th, 30th, and 31st.
1412	Please path this in Unify and let me know when its done.
1412	Thanks.
1413	Attached are my demand charges and CGAS activity for December.
1413	Jeff, I have all the prices in my worksheet.
1413	It would be easy to calculate one citygate price to put on our big citygate deal ticket.
1413	And we are still out of balance starting on the 22nd.
1414	Would you please be so kind and take a peek at this.
1415	Thanks for the Oglethorpe.
1415	I just sent my info to Mr. Homco for review.
1415	Would you please send me the December purchases and sales for New Power?
1415	thanks
1416	This is ready to go.
1416	I highlighted areas that you need to fill in. Thanks.
1417	I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.
1417	The amount is $5,606.78 and it is for the the 2000 tax year.
1417	I was notified about this yesterday and I think it was due on 12/31/2000.
1417	How do you want to handle this?
1417	I was going to pay it and bill New Power for the whole amount.
1417	I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.
1417	Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.
1417	Thanks
1418	Question: We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch storage for the 2000 tax year.
1418	I found out yesterday that ENA handles no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that.
1418	Do you know what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year?
1418	We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage.
1418	I assume this would all be for CES/New Power.
1418	If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for the 2000 tax year, please let me know.
1418	Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you.
1418	Thanks Chris.
1419	Good point.
1419	Is that also Bear Creek storage?
1419	The tax bill specifically states Sonat Bear Creek storage.
1419	I also left a voicemail for our tax guy.
1419	There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority comes up with their number.
1419	I would like to see it but I bet it takes a while to get the support.
1419	I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.
1419	We have some type of deal with NOPSI.
1419	Any other ideas on that?
1420	We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.
1420	The primary receipt point on this contract is storage.
1420	BUT, we can flow some of this gas from secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.
1420	How much gas can be sourced from Secondary receipt points?
1421	Hey gang.
1421	Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.
1421	I have fixed the pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual invoice.
1421	Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual invoice?
1421	If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and not actual flow volumes.
1421	AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?
1422	Raquel, Robert Tilotta has the original tax bill and he is in your office.
1422	His number is 713-853-7995.
1422	Please call him at your convience.
1422	Robert, can the tax agency provide us with support (contract numbers, inventory balances...)?
1422	Thanks
1423	In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points.
1423	That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.
1423	So you are telling me the "rules have changed"?
1423	I can now flow 100% from secondary points?
1424	See below to see what "The Man" has to say.
1425	For Tues through the end of the month, please show Tenn Z5 and Z6 flat, and have the Wright gas into Canajoharie.
1425	Tenn, I will be looking at what we have available on the Net 284 contract on your sheet to determine our flexibility.
1426	Anyone here today??
1426	Deliverd prices are about $12.75 right now, using Non NY pricing.
1427	My buddy is looking at lots on Seargent Beach.
1427	Drive from your place to Seargent, go over the intercoastal, and take a left.
1427	He said lots in there go for about $17,000.00.
1427	He wants to buy one canal lot and one or two beach lots.
1427	Comments?
1428	The 2 Transco delivery points for the CP&L RFP (#6608 and #6562) are upstream of the Zone 5 pool.
1428	So we should be able to segment the longhaul VNG space.
1428	Meter Mainline Mile Marker / Lateral Mile Marker
1429	I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.
1429	I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!
1429	Joann, for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the AO6 they are buying from us).
1429	Which means we should only have 3844 out of the pool.
1429	Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows Vol Comment 3844 Out of the pool 25893 Other receipt supply xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.
1430	These are the meter numbers I changed on deal 549411 effective 1/8/2001.
1430	The total changed on the deal was a decrease of 31205.
1431	Do you know the details of the Dynegy contract?
1432	Darla, this invoice is incorrect.
1432	Please send out the manual invoice I sent you.
1433	Buddy, we need to chat.
1434	Please let me know what ENA is taking from New Power's pool and what New Power is taking from ENA's pool for the following dates Date Jan 1 Jan 2 Jan 3 Thanks.
1435	Please bookout deal 563831 with deal 563837.
1436	You are so wonderful.
1436	I am truly privlidged to work with you.
1436	OK.
1436	I would like for you to send Mr. Porter the remaining storage balance every other day and copy me - something like this.
1436	Date 1/7/2001 Balance 3,495,871 And I would do it on a 2 day lag like this, today is the 9th, give him the balance for the 7th.
1436	Or maybe you are doing this already?
1437	I've made some changes to the sales.
1437	Would you please send me another excel worksheet for December?
1437	thanks
1438	Would you guys see what is flowing current day at these points please?
1439	I don't know if this was ever resolved but Susan Pereira's name is on the deal ticket.
1440	Where is my new Oglethorpe sheet?
1441	Exactly what an old married guy would think too!
1442	I changed all the volumes to 0 on this deal now that I have a good picture of what took place.
1442	Please make sure you have 0 pathed on these deals for the 1st through the 4th.
1442	thanks
1443	In the fridge next to the mustard.
1444	Jeff, don't forget that Mike is taking 27835 of the FOM gas into his pool everyday.
1444	With the Maumee cuts, I am showing that you are buying gas daily from ENA everyday.
1444	Column T under the CGAS tab shows what Gas Daily volumes you are taking from me.
1444	Column V shows the Gas Daily sells you are making to me.
1444	Column F is the citygate storage number that should match cell Q41 on your COH sheet.
1444	We have one big discrepancy on the 8th.
1444	Call me if you have questions.
1444	Joann, on the 8th, Jeff is showing a withdrawal of 57431(citygate number) we are showing a volume of 49560 (48478 at the citygate).
1444	Would you check that please.
1445	Could you send me the excel worksheet so I won't have to recreate it?
1445	Man you are a true Buddy!!
1446	Please take the volumes to 0 for these 2 Hopewell deals on Dec 31.
1446	Deal Robin, I took the price to 0 on both of these deals.
1447	Tim Ray is "The Man" at New Power to talk to about the any asset management deals.
1447	I would love to be involved.
1447	Mr. David Scott can get you Tim's number.
1448	I'll call you this afternoon after Joann and I talk about the storage volumes for Dec. Jeffrey Porter@EES
1449	Could we meet to go over this?
1449	AND are there any other folks we should invite?
1450	Thursday PM would be ok.
1450	Would you set it up please?
1451	contract T016937.
1451	Our new MDQ is 14,225 for Jan.
1452	Anyone there?
1452	I sold 2500 at $6.94
1453	Dick is changing his sell to NP price to $7.22
1454	Should we just take the capaity for Feb and March or do you want to release the whole term then recall it later?
1455	These rates are correct and I'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool (no surcharges).
1455	Zone 4 to 4 is the most expensive zone on the pipe, Zone 5 runs a close second.
1455	Are you sure you want 4 instead of 4a (mobile bay)?
1456	I sure wish you would send me the excel worksheet for this.
1456	I'm such a lazy butt.
1457	Just looking high level, I see 3 days where storage is off by more than 1,000 dt's that I will check into.
1457	Date Sitara Jeff's I don't understand your storage number on the 16th.
1457	Does that mean you banked gas that day?
1457	Also, I setup a column for Navigator numbers and it looks like we took out I need to reconcile storage back to Nov so I can track what we took out vs. what we pay New Power for.
1458	I just checked the 24th, the actual number per navigator (actuals delivered to New Power from Stow) is 54246.
1458	I'll check the others on Monday now that I know how to do it.
1459	It's Leah Moss at the pipeline.
1459	It's Judy Townsend here.
1459	Leah's number is
1460	Its ok to do the netout.
1460	The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they enter the pipeline statements in Unify.
1461	Let me know if you have questions.
1461	I think we need to add Nov 2000.
1461	AND, according to Navigator, the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is 2,973,373.
1461	Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000, the balance is 3,013,373 which is about 49% of the total storage balance.
1461	Is this a comfortable number or Joann, are there any special storage rules for Feb and March?
1461	Are we required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001?
1462	Is this what you are looking for?
1463	I'm here for you.
1463	Just remember me favorably when you become my boss someday.
1463	I fetch coffe and pop, I always keep a stash of crackers,...
1463	the list goes on.
1464	Please educate me - what are the current cashout rules?
1465	Thanks.
1465	You are wonderfulllll!
1466	Yo!
1466	Give Aaron his gift!
1467	How does the VNG GSS work?
1467	AND, Jerry and Barbara are coming to Houston tonight.
1467	They want to go to P F Changs.
1467	Jerry said they would leave around 6:00 Pm putting them here around 6:45 to 7:00PM.
1467	Of course you are invited and I told him I would let him know where to meet us when they hit the road.
1467	Questions?
1468	I'm emailing all of you because I never know how the deals will show up in Sitara.
1468	This is how Leidy looks for Feb Buy/Sale Counterparty Volume Comment Buy Poco 15,380 NFUL into Trco at Leidy Buy Bay State 5000 CNG into Trco/Tetco at Leidy OR CNG SP from the storage meter Sell N Jersey 2491 Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy, we usually match with Poco Sell Southern 5000 Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy, Brad just sold this gas today.
1468	we should match with Poco.
1468	Buy ENA Transport 9005 We have transport on NFUL, we sold 9189 to Canada desk for Feb, We will idle our transport.
1468	Let me know if you have any questions.
1469	I will send these as I find them.
1469	This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the April 2000 manual invoice.
1469	It looks like the only deals that should have been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales.
1469	Line 7 under the "Manual Invoice" tab applies to deal 268094, volume of 615600 at $3.1279, sale to CES for Proxy storage injections.
1469	Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113, sales to CES at the citygate.
1469	Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to swing.
1469	Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on deals 227081 and 227113.
1469	Line 9????
1469	I still can't figure out what I did here.
1469	I think everything else is sorta clear.
1470	Lines 6, 7, & 8 are sales to CES at the citygate, deals 250126 and 250131.
1470	The schedulers wanted 2 deal tickets for tracking purposes.
1470	The pricing should be the same.
1470	I did make a teeny little error, line 7 should be prices at $3.4228 and line 8 should be priced at $3.4428.
1471	I'm sorry.
1471	I'm still looking for it but I think I deleted all the photo's.
1471	I'm checking my CD's.
1471	Just pretend you are getting a big hug from me and that I'm taking you to your favorite resteraunt - Chic Fil A.
1472	According to my numbers, I show we have taken 67,560 out of storage through today.
1472	And we are taking out 12,995 (2599 x 5 days) from the 27th - 31st.
1472	Could you double check my numbers please?
1472	Thanks
1473	How do you make those ham and tortillia thingys?
1473	I want to make some for the super bowl party this Sunday.
1474	Please change deal 583629 (sale to Mirant on NFUL) to Market East.
1474	It won't let me change it.
1474	Thanks
1475	Just spoke with Jerry.
1475	Jerry, Barbara, the bird and the squirrel are on their way to East Texas.
1476	Scott Goodell is the expert on this pipeline and I just can't say enough good things about him.
1477	I changed the Egan volumes for the 30th and 31st from 2599 to 4793 on the 30th and 4794 on the 31st.
1477	This empties out our storage.
1478	Hey Matt.
1478	Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.
1478	I probably won't move for another 9 months.
1478	I have some legal issues I'm heavily involved in that will be taking up a lot of my time.
1478	Thanks.
1479	You are welcome and have a nice day!
1480	Hey Woman!
1480	This is the email I sent to my folks last week regarding Egan.
1481	More Judy contracts for Feb Contract Volume Comment And Judith bought 1 dt of Stx Exit/ Wla Entry.
1481	I won't be informing you of this cotract number.
1482	It's purtty!
1483	Transco capacity for Feb 1.8793 n/a Use to flow Nful Leidy to CNG Leidy, no fuel.
1483	we have a rate of $.01 through March 31.
1483	1.8793 n/a Can use to flow Ragley to Mamou, no fuel, we have a rate of $.01 for Feb. For the 1st, we will be serving NYPA from Texas Gas.
1484	I just moved the following 2 sales to New Power from Trco Non NY to CGAS - WGL, deals 377264 (volume = 515 day) and deal 377268 (volume = 5 day).
1484	Joann, New Power will probably take some of this gas to BG&E.
1485	Since we are suppose to be using IT, I would say Doyle's cashout should be $7.611, the IT buy in zone 6.
1485	You sure are a buddy, why don't you send me an updated doyle sheet?

1487	Subject: Cute story Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.
1487	When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.' ?
1487	They stopped that crap after I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.
1488	Where?
1488	Just curious.
1489	yeah, I'm really busy.
1489	I gotta wash my hair.
1489	Where you guys going just in case I someone ask me?
1490	She doesn't know that I exist, now that I'm single again and all.
1490	I should be able to lose 30 or 40 pounds by then.
1491	The gloves are off and the courtship begins - what's your work address?
1491	Valentine goodies are on the way.
1491	I'm officially in love...

1495	I'll buy the next time we go to Chic Fil A!
1496	I have problems sending things to you and Mike.
1497	I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.
1497	If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities are the same now.
1497	In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was $.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.
1497	We actually did some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.
1497	I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until October, after the summer period?

1499	Hey - I just started taking a Spanish class last week.
1499	My class name is Miguel and I'm a cocinero!
1500	Nope.
1500	How's that for an anwser.
1500	Noone responded and I would be more than happy to have a big ol meeting on it too.
1501	Scott Goodell said the Sonat items look correct.
1501	The other items are for the Central Desk and I don't know who looks at it.
1501	It's probably ok since the Central Desk items are more straight forward.
1502	Transco confirmed that effective 2/1/2001, the forward haul and back haul commodity rates will be the same on both IT and FT.
1503	Could you give me the January 2001 Gas Daily's for the following points Texas Eastern Transco Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3 Thanks
1504	Beverly, what do you think?
1505	I'g going to have Judy work Tansco over for a backhaul discount for the summer.
1506	We've never done this, I'm just thinking they may work with us on it since no one knew the rates were going to be effective 2/1/2001.
1507	Still hurts but just when I move it.
1507	Woke up at 4:15 am this morning.

1517	I show you taking an extra 500 dts or so everyday.

1518	I show you taking an extra 500 dts per day and you show selling me back about 500 dts everyday.
1519	From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001) Worker dead at desk for 5 days Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.
1519	George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.
1519	He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was still working during the weekend.
1519	His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself. "A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary.
1519	Ironically, George was proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.
1519	You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick occasionally.
1520	Can you verify what New Power is getting at A06 please?
1521	Doesn't look too good right now.
1521	I forgot about the HPL people.
1521	I think we already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many HPL people are staying with Enron on the trading side.
1521	I'll keep you posted.
1521	If you are bud's with Scott Hendrickson, he would be a good one to talk to.
1521	I don't want to mention your name unless I hear of something.
1522	Sounds good.
1523	Please send me a download of the Oglethorpe info for January.
1523	We might be able to do the billing from Unify this month.
1523	If not, I should be able to make the dollars match.
1523	thanks
1524	I'm looking for the following demand charges Do you see those anywhere?
1524	They are on deal 554846.
1525	This is what's in Unify.
1525	The only odd item is how I entered the cashout, as a negative demand charge.
1525	I used 1618 dts x $7.611 (It buy in Zone 6).
1525	Let me know what you think.
1525	Maybe we should add the IT transport to the cashout from Z6 to Z4.
1525	I would certainly want to do that if they were short.
1526	I made some changes to New Power.
1526	Would you please send me a new purchase and sales worksheet for Jan?
1526	thanks
1527	Mr. Homco gave this his stamp of approval.
1527	It's ready to go.

1528	Would you send me the Gas Daily's for Henry Hub, Transco St 65, Transco St Thanks
1529	This is everything scheduled on CGAS except the pool for the 1st.
1529	I'm working on that now.
1530	Per navigator, this is the only New Power pool activity for the 1st.

1533	We have set up this VNG contract in Sitara twice, as 6507 (see deal 512077) and .6507 Currently all Transco contracts have the decimal preceding the number.
1533	Please terminate 6507 effective 12/31/2000.
1533	Thanks
1534	Hey buddy, would you check these numbers?
1534	This is what's on our Transco reports for the deliveries to Doyle.

1535	I wuzn't invited to the wedding.
1535	AND when you sit down and think about the hedges and transport stuff, you will be surprised at how much stuff you remember.
1535	The quickest way to learn transport???
1535	Get copies of the invoices.
1535	And guess what, I got another compliment on my sweat pants on Saturday!!!
1536	I would like to see the Gas Daily's for the following, no rush.
1536	Transco Z6 NY Transco Z6 Non NY Transco St 65 Henry Hub Tetco M3
1537	We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to Midcoast.
1537	You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.
1537	Just a note, we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much higher transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $0 transport cost.
1537	Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.
1537	By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.
1537	The IT feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001, fuel remains unchanged at .45%.
1538	I ended deal 340210 effective 2/28/01 and created deal 630810 effective 3/1/2001.
1538	But, I see both deals active un Unify on contract 2891 on 3/1/2001.
1538	I don't know what impact this will have, if any.

1540	Can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please?
1541	I just checked and I don't have any daily information.

1546	My Canadian folks gave me the wrong number for March.

1546	Which makes the spread
1547	FYI
1548	Transco Z6 cashout buy is 5.5393, and I think it traded around $5.52.
1548	We will use the $5.5393 and I'll send you and email.

1574	For the year My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.
1574	This morining it should have been $123035.00.
1574	I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued at CNG IF flat.
1574	I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.
1575	I think you have my NYMX value in backwards.
1576	What do you think?
1577	What mid price does this deal come to TP2 at?
1577	Deal 655067
1578	I changed the price on deal 636796 back to TRCO Z6 Non Ny.

1579	I'm going to start burying my money in a tin can somewhere.
1579	I also keep thinking about buying a place and/or a new car.
1579	But then I look at my $20.00 utility bill - thats a hard thing to ingnore.
1579	Someones waiting for me here.
1579	Chat with you later.
1580	This is good to go.
1580	How about a new New Power download - I've been tweaking here and there.
1581	Numbers still look good after inputting the 27th and the 28th.
1582	How am I suppossed to determine a good back doctor from a bad back doctor??
1583	I'm thinking about a Nissan Pathfinder.
1583	Then I think about just keeping my money and driving what I have.
1584	Thats it for now.
1584	Thanks.
1584	I will probably have questions next week.

1590	TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas (deal 632998) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF (deal 657407).
1590	TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost (deal 657409) at St 45.
1590	It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel.
1590	SO, I just changed the price on deal 657409 from Z2 IF + .09 to Z2 IF + .045.
1590	We should see about $68,000.00 move from TP2 to Gulf 1.
1591	On the 8th, we went short on TP2 at St 65.
1591	I created deal 665147 as a TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 65.
1591	I entered the price as Z3 GD.
1591	Please let me know if you want to adjust it.
1591	thanks
1592	I created deal 665150, TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 30 priced at GD.
1592	We did this on the 7th because we didn't sell the St 30.
1593	I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming back from Jerry's yesterday.
1593	I kept getting a message like "We're sorry, this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers" or something like that.
1593	I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a couple of weeks ago.
1594	Transco party on the 21st.
1594	I'm going, how about you?

1597	Kim, I would like to invite Joni to our Gas Fair party.
1597	Please send her the info via email?

1599	My appointment is next Monday at 2:00Pm
1600	Judy also bought 10,000 dt of long haul from you.
1600	Whats the term and the demand on that?
1600	thanks
1601	I updated the transport demand charges on Tetco and Trco for March.
1601	Please get those in the P&L sometime this week.
1601	Also note: I think I had Trco at TP1 instead of TP2.
1601	thanks
1602	NOOOO!
1602	Tell me it isn't so!!!
1603	You are welcome.
1603	I'm glad you enjoyed them.

1605	Hey, I'm getting a mental image here ( of you pawing the ground that is)!!
1605	Backs doing ok right now.
1605	I'm getting a second opinion next Monday.
1605	If the second opinion comes in with the same verdict, then I will probably have the surgery in April or May.
1605	Jerry said a friend of his told him it took a whole month to recover.
1605	I'm thinking a week max then I can go back to work, we shall see.
1605	I can't make money if I'm not at work, and my p&l is a big part of my evaluation next year.
1605	AND I'm afraid to buy a new truck with the stock market situation.
1605	Who knows - I may be out of work sometime soon.
1606	Thanks for the invite.
1606	I won't be able to golf for awhile.
1607	I'm very tired.

1614	Stacey with NYPA will be at the Hyatt (next door) on next Tuesday and it sounds like she has no plans Tuesday evening (hint hint).
1614	Let me know if you are interested in doing anything.

1617	Uhhhhh - Stacey with NYPA is coming in on Tuesday and wants to come over and visit with all of us.

1620	I'm so pooooooor now.

1622	We need to deliver gas to this point.
1623	Because I know you care - I feel terrible today - mostly my head.
1623	How can that be if there is nothing there???
1623	I don't know if its alergies or what.
1624	This is copied out of Transco's system and its allll i got.
1625	YES I DID!

1627	We don't even need to chat with NYPA about this either.
1628	Better polish those horns :o)
1629	Dudes like Chics with horns!
1630	I approved the following deals Please do your economic voodoo.
1631	On call for the weekend.
1632	Buddy!
1633	Let me know if you guys are receiving the Transco postings.
1634	Robin Barbe did a long term sale to EES.
1634	The volume is 1200 dt/day.
1634	EES has the option of taking delivery at Tenn Zone 5, meter #20816 or on CNG (Dominion), meter DOMSP.
1634	The contract price to EES is the same at both locations.
1634	Deal 624140 is the sale on Tenn. EES requested the volumes on CNG effective 3/23/2001.
1634	I created deal 686905 for the sale on EES.
1634	Kimat, I assume the CNG will need to hedged.
1635	Phil, please call Jim Homco to discuss Oglethorpes needs.
1635	His extension is
1636	Lunch was terrible today.
1636	I don't know who it was though.
1637	He didn't invite me.
1637	He don't know what's good for him does he?
1637	AND he lives in a bad neighborhood.
1638	I should be getting my uzzi out of the shop on Friday too!
1639	My contacts at The New Power company said you should call this number
1640	According to Nelson this deal should be on GULF3, not GULF1.
1640	Woul you pleachange it?
1640	Thanks
1641	I just sent in a request for a new CGAS/NFUL interconnect - request #2410.
1641	I entered meter number 6000065 for NFUL, it should be 600065.
1642	My numbers match.
1642	You de MAN
1643	If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.
1643	If you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge on TCO at all.
1643	Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SST Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.
1643	When you use SST to go from STOW to the Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).
1643	Backs doing ok.
1643	Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.
1643	And yes it has been a stressfull bid week.
1643	But you r probably making tons of dough.

1645	I see you ran the March demand charges through TP2 over the weekend.
1645	What about April or are you waiting for us to clean it up?
1646	No back surgery yet.
1646	Second opinion Dr. said "let's just wait for 3 months and see what happens. We can always do the surgery."
1646	I liked that idea.
1646	Give Mom and Dad a big hug for me.
1647	Hey Buddy!

1649	Hey Buddy!!!!
1649	Wrong worksheet.
1650	I just left Cingy a message - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.
1650	However, it could have been done by CES or EES.
1650	I asked her to call me back.
1651	I wanted to send you this email before I deleted it.
1651	Everything may have been taken care of already.
1652	Would you see how much vacation I have taken for the year please.
1652	I took my floating holiday and 1/2 day of vaca on my last time sheet.

1653	BUDDY!@!!!

1660	By the way - I'm on vacation for a week or so startig Friday.
1660	I should have New Power updated by tomorrow.
1661	Russ, could you kill this deal please?
1661	I keep getting a weird message when I try to kill it.
1662	It's missing the demand charge.
1662	I'll get you to rerun it for me in the morning and see if the demand charge shows up.
1663	You De Man!!!!
1664	Cool!!
1664	I'll start cleaning my apartment.

1669	Good to go.
1669	Thanks
1670	Spoke to the tax lady today.
1670	She mailed an extension for mine and my fathers taxes.
1670	I just know you guys care.
1670	I mailed all of Dad's tax stuff to her Sunday and she received it yesterday.
1671	I don't have good numbers for the 30 or 31st yet but you I think everythink else is good.
1672	You are a good gradson.
1672	I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma Monday night.
1672	I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times if I had a girlfriend.
1672	By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was married with 6 kids.
1672	She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.
1672	I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.
1672	I got short around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.
1672	Let's see - I've only lost $185,000.00 today.
1672	Oh well, its just money I guess.
1672	Its funny how unhappy that makes me.
1672	I'm gonna go pout now.
1672	Later
1673	Getting short means I'm selling now - expecting the price to go down - and then buying.
1673	Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then selling.
1673	I think you should be doing this with cattle futures.
1673	Right now I down $290,000.00 for the day.
1674	Please bookout the following deals that I entered for 3/31/2001.
1674	Match purchase deal 718081 with sales deal 718078.
1674	I think this is my last New Power deal forever.
1675	Thanks for the card.
1675	It was very nice.
1676	I'm done with March.
1676	Take a look and let me know what you think.
1677	I added a couple of deals that will not show up until the morning.
1677	If you could rerun this first thing tomorrow I would appreciate it.
1677	Thanks
1678	Uhhh - NO.
1678	I did clean the bathroom last nite.
1678	I do that once every couple of months whether it needs it or not.
1679	We should probably look at this sounds like a Hattiesburgh type deal to me.
1679	Gas Storage Facility to Be Sold Immediately A natural gas storage facility in Monroe County, Mississippi which is ready to be built out is being offered to be sold immediately.
1679	It will be connected to Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern and others.
1679	It has 12 BCF of total storage capacity and 8 BCF of working gas storage, with HIGH deliverability.
1679	This project is worth considerably more than the $4.2 million asked by the owners, who need to sell it quickly.
1679	The deadline for offers or serious interest is April 13, 2001.
1679	For more information on this gas storage facility please call (985) 893-9225.
1679	EFS Energy or write: storage@enerfax.com
1680	I'm out next week.

1681	This is how I priced the deal Sandra's May-Oct physical Ela Basis offer was about ($.0725) The screen was aroung $5.30 Variable .4500 Price to Customer .48 We would do this to the extent Judy could get the capacity.
1682	Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.
1682	I had fun at Disney.
1682	The airshow was a bit of a let down though.
1682	AND NO, I didn't buy an airplane.
1682	Now I'm thinking ...
1682	boat...
1682	yeah that sounds real good.
1682	See what you can find me.
1682	I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.
1682	However, I checked new car prices on the internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.
1682	New cars are so expensive.
1682	So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.
1682	Just came in to work for a few min.
1682	Later.
1683	You really don't care about my back do you?????
1683	Its doing ok.
1683	Went to Florida with my brother last week.
1683	Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.
1683	Enjoyed both very much.
1683	That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.
1683	Need to go with a Chic next time though.
1683	Mr. Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.
1683	And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.
1683	Behave yourself girl.
1684	Very funny!
1685	Very funny!
1686	Hey there.
1686	I was on vacation on the 9th.
1686	I guess its ok to send out the invoice now.
1687	Then try AEP in Columbus.
1687	They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there.
1688	According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.
1688	We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65 Most of the time we use option #1.
1688	Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.
1688	However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.
1688	For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.
1688	The total transport cost is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).
1688	We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.
1688	Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price and the transport expense?
1689	Please give Judy Townsend, Scott Goodell, and myself the ability to trade the physical Canadian products.
1689	We need to be able to see them on EOL.
1689	Thanks
1690	Congratulations on the good news.
1690	Sorry to hear about the bad news.
1690	There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.
1690	Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.
1690	Also, you might chat with AEP.
1690	They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston.
1691	This isn't the right guy but he can get you to someone - Mike Garred x35488.
1692	YES I AM.
1692	What are the dates?
1692	And I love your outfit today.
1693	Did she show you her tatoo?
1693	I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.
1693	I'm thinking about driving myself.
1693	Your the boss, what do you think?
1694	This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.
1694	I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.
1694	Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.
1695	YES I AM.
1695	What are the dates?
1695	And I love your outfit today.
1696	1.
1696	May Only $.4300 Just wanted to show the diff between May and the rest of the summer.
1696	Let me know how this looks.
1696	3.
1696	Nov/Mar no offer
1697	Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.
1697	You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.
1698	Ernie's on the team now.
1699	I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.
1699	I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see.
1699	I guess women can be sensitive.
1699	Ingrid's fine - and you?
1699	How's your man?
1700	U forgot to copy you brother.
1700	I don't think he did it.
1700	I think it just kicked in somehow.
1701	Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines?
1702	How sweet.
1702	Its doing ok.
1702	A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
1702	That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.
1702	Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!
1702	What's up with you girl?
1703	You like (cat) attitude don't you?
1703	And what makes you think my stomach is cushy??????
1704	Ernie's on the team now.
1705	I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.
1705	Maybe CES should just be you??
1705	AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.
1705	But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.
1705	I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.
1705	I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email.
1706	She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.
1706	She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.
1706	Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.
1706	I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.
1706	I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.
1706	Good luck.
1707	Ernie, this is what I think.
1707	ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.
1707	I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.
1707	Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.
1707	Comments, questions?
1708	Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines?
1709	The truth is out there!
1709	Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day Computer Gender An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names, and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she."
1709	One of the students raised her hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"
1709	The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups: males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine.
1709	Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.
1709	The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because: 1.
1709	In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
1709	2.
1709	They have a lot of data but are still clueless.
1709	3.
1709	They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem.
1709	4.
1709	As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.
1709	The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because: 1.
1709	No one but their creator understands their internal logic.
1709	2.
1709	The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.
1709	3.
1709	Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.
1709	4.
1709	As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.
1710	I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy :)
1711	Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.

1740	Little correction going forward The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.27 TCO Offer plus $.19
1741	We would have been around $.39 to $.42.

1744	Hey.
1744	I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.
1744	Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.
1744	One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.
1744	It was nice.
1744	I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!
1744	The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.
1744	All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.
1744	I could really get used to that sort of thing.
1744	The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.
1744	I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.
1744	Keep looking for my BOAT.
1744	Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.
1744	She stayed with me all weekend.
1744	I took her to the airport this morining.
1744	Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.
1744	I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.
1744	That was a little odd.
1744	Nothing else going on.
1744	I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.
1744	Later Gator.

1753	I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.
1754	I entered ($4.9951) x 12dt which should give them a credit on the invoice.
1754	I also entered a demand of $93835.00.
1754	These items should show up seperate on the invoice.

1761	This volume was entered on deal 760980, which is a VNG buy from Gulf 1.
1761	I took the volume on this deal to 0 for the 8th and created deal 780794 (VNG buy from TP2 at St 65).
1761	Please make a note in you files.
1761	Meredith, you will need to repath these deals on the 8th.
1761	Thanks
1762	Demand charges are showing up now.
1762	We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.
1762	My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.
1762	I don't know how that part works.
1762	Dara, are you volume manangement??
1763	Mr. Homco will have to answer that one.
1764	I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.
1764	The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.
1764	How should we put this in Sitara.
1764	I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.
1764	How do we get the money back from PSE&G?
1765	Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.
1765	Everything has been signed by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.
1765	I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.
1765	IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.
1765	I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be.
1765	BE NICE NOW.
1766	Mr. Homco will have to answer that one.
1767	We sold the National Fuel back to the Canadian desk for June at NX1 + $.235.

1767	Kimat, please forward to the Canadian Book Admin.
1768	The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.

1769	YOU BET.
1769	I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by Walgreen's for drugs, pick up a "guy" movie, then drop by the immer palace.
1770	Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.
1770	I'll just give you the highlights.
1770	Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC. MHP currently operates 2 facilities.
1770	The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La. I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.
1770	I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.
1771	It is over with.
1771	The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.
1771	But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!
1771	The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable") I don't think its that simple though.
1771	What do you think?
1771	So what are you doing this weekend?
1772	We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM.
1772	Comments ????

1779	She's a heathen like you.
1780	A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing.
1780	The game warden asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"
1780	The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."
1780	"Pet fish?!"
1780	the warden asked.
1780	"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home."
1780	"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"
1780	The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here, I'll show you. It really works."
1780	"O.K. I've GOT to see this!."
1780	The game warden was curious, now.
1780	The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.
1780	After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, "Well?"
1780	"Well, What?"
1780	the man responded.
1780	"When are you going to call them back?"
1780	The game warden prompted.
1780	"Call who back?"
1780	The man asked.
1780	"The fish."
1780	replied the warden.
1780	"What fish?"
1780	The man asked.
1781	How many deals have you done????

1811	You need to add the following surcharges for other delivery points.
1811	Great Plains .0097
1812	Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you.
1812	That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L.
1813	Scott Profitt was looking for your phone number.
1813	I gave it too him.
1813	I think he misses you.

1817	Shooting for triple digits?
1818	Actually I don't need any more as long as my prospective mate has 1 or 2 less than me :o)
1819	Hey, it works for me.
1820	I want PHOTOs!!!!
1821	It's not her fault.
1821	First, everything she does or knows is officially my business.
1821	Second, I tortured her to get information.
1821	Third, she's a great ol' big heifer (<==female cow often used to produce many offspring) and she really needs to go.
1822	locations 3224b
1823	Yes I have and I still don't like it!
1824	Take a look.
1824	Let me know what you think.
1825	I called to hassle you and you were not there.
1825	The lady from Mike's party called me today.
1825	She wants to show me a couple of houses.
1825	What do you think?
1825	I told her tomorrow would be4 fine.
1826	I have to keep working until you get here!!!!!!
1827	Suzanne is here.
1827	She said you and her are doing some Manual work this weekend.
1827	You and I are breaking up for the weekend but I need to get my car back first.
1827	Maybe after we go to the movie.
1827	PS Scott said the resteraunt to go to in Round Top is "Royers".
1827	He said you go shop for antique crap and then go eat at this place.
1828	I would leave early if I were you.
1829	I finished all but one.
1829	Guess what time I finished????
1829	Oh, and we have until the end of today to finish them.
1830	Did mine.
1830	Need to do one for this person in risk management.
1830	I finished at 12:15
1831	I'll call later with a whole bunch of tedious contract changes.
1832	We have some Trco long haul capacity for 1 year starting 5/1/2001, contract 3.8924.
1832	This is a mini asset deal with PSE&G.
1832	Transco has agreed to bill PSE&G for the demand charge.
1832	I took the demand charge off the sheet and zeroed out sitara effective 5/1/2001.
1833	Jeanne, effective 6/1/2001, we are going to move the TGT transport from TP1 to TP3.
1834	I dialed Suzie's number and Liz anwsered.

1837	Please check the hedges.
1837	Deals 816519 and 816524
1838	I did take a look at the $139,000 home.
1838	This house has been on the market for awhile.
1838	The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.
1838	I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.
1838	Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.
1838	Another thing that bothers me is the economy.
1838	All I hear about are layoffs.
1838	The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.
1838	That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.
1838	Thanks for the info though.
1839	there is a lot of good stuff on this web site.
1839	Click on "HARDWARE REVIEWS" then select "DIGITAL CAMERAS".

1850	I'm coming over after i work out tomorrow too.
1850	I won't see you Friday or Saturday.
1851	Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.
1851	Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills.
1851	CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill.
1851	I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed.
1852	Reply to this if you get it.
1853	Sending via Microsoft Outlook.
1853	Does this work?
1853	$3.7875 by $3.7925
1854	This is the demand charge for The New Power Market area demand charges.
1854	It's under the "New Retail Mrkt" tab on 2001new03.xls.
1854	They owe us the dough.
1855	Sorry about that.
1855	Rerun the invoice and send it to me.
1855	Thanks
1856	Dude, this needs your blessing.
1857	done
1858	I sold 4,035 dt to the Ontario Desk on NFUL for Sep at +.12 (deal 1016673).
1858	The following deals should be transferred from Brads book to the CNG and East TP3 books at a mid value of NX1 + .1675 for Sep.

1858	thanks
1859	Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.
1859	Thanks.
1859	Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?
1859	It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.
1860	The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).
1860	I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.
1860	Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.
1860	Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.
1860	I don't know if you need to be involved or not.
1861	We have an discount on Tenn, for the 25th only.
1861	k#2891, MDQ = 5000, rate = $.30, Receipt point = Z0, delivery point = Tewksbury in Tenn Z6.
1862	I moved the sale to NYPA at Mamou from TP3 to TP1 effective 10/1/2001.
1862	The old deal number is 815952.
1862	The new deal number is 1063956.
1862	Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.
1862	Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?
1862	Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.
1863	FYI
1864	When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.
1864	TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.
1864	Part of the problem is deal 1016655.
1864	I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.
1864	These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.
1864	My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846 roughly 9189 x 4 days).
1864	TRCO Team, would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?
1864	I would like to see if that has an impact.
1865	Thanks.
1866	TP1 sold 323 day at CGLF IF + .0175 for Oct, deal 1064505, to EES.
1867	I've been using Scott Goodell's password and ID because mine doesn't work.

1869	Would you change the desk on deal 1064348 from Gulf2 to East TP1 please?
1870	I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.
1870	The volume is 14,288 per day.
1870	The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.

1870	I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.
1870	Robert, please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use.
1870	We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.
1870	It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month.
1871	????
1871	At Leach or the Pool.
1872	I'll be at the Texas Gas shin dig.
1873	Got my ID and password fixed.

1873	I just tried to call him but there was no anwser.
1874	When I look up this contract in Passkey, I show an MDQ of 16,373.
1874	We think it should be 4723 with the following primary receipt points.
1874	Leg MDQ I might be looking in the wrong screen.
1874	I am going under contracts/contract maintenance/review
1875	Robert, Rhonda may be adjusting the Leach volume (14,288) up or down a few dth's to balance every day.
1875	That's ok.
1875	Somebody tell Barker what a nice guy I am.
1876	The End Date on the following Park & Loan contracts has been extended from 9/30/01 to 10/31/01.
1876	Contract Deal I had to create new sitara numbers because the old deal numbers were "Baseload" instead of "Term".
1877	Did you get your info?
1878	Let me or Gerald know if you have any questions.
1879	Looks like I have the wrong contract.
1879	thanks

1897	This deal is effective 11/1/2001 - 10/31/2002?
1897	Thanks
1898	done
1899	Got it.
1900	I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore.
1900	What are you doing?
1901	Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.
1901	As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .
1901	The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.
1901	Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.
1901	If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.
1901	This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.
1901	However, we do support intra-day capacity release.
1902	This is the guy in charge of all the transport for Cinergy.
1902	I have not been able to speak to him because he is out of the office so much.
1902	And I don't know if I'm still in his good graces either.
1903	In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.
1903	The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.
1903	New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.
1903	The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.
1903	New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.
1903	ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.
1904	My girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around January.
1904	But not too many people know about that.
1904	If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it.
1904	Don't want no kitties.
1904	I'm going home now because I've lost so much money today.
1904	BYE
1905	I thought you mite do that :o)
1906	We have a discounted IT rate of $.25 for Oct. Receipt Points are 500L & 800L, Delivery points are Tenn Z6.
1907	Contract 888850 CDS Demand Charges effective 7/1/99 Rate Vol Factor Amount Contract Adjustment -$5,804.59 Days 31 Unit Rate 0.5532
1908	Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes on Sep 14th?
1908	We had discounts before and after so it seems like we would have a discount for that day as well.
1908	I can't find anything in my notes.
1908	Thanks
1909	FYI - just sent this note to Tenn.
1910	I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.
1910	Its only a diff of $80 or so.
1910	So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it.
1910	Thanks
1911	Forget it.
1911	I don't need your lecture.
1912	I get real tired of this guy.
1912	For whatever reason he and I just don't seem to comunicate real well.
1913	You should call me so I can harass you.
1914	I'm still passing out your name and number to people that are looking.
1914	I only give it to people that I think would fit in a capacity role.
1914	Are you OK with that or should I stop?
1915	IT FT Fuel FT Demand All rates include ACA but no GRI.
1916	Put me down for $25.00 NOT PER MILE YOU CRAZY WOMAN>
1917	Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.
1917	So I have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.
1917	I propose that I stay home and be a house husband.
1917	You would have a hot (oatmeal) meal waiting for you when you get home.

1922	I know you told me that this capacity could be released.
1922	Can it be released in 4 seperate peices?
1922	Plus I may be doing permanent releases too.
1922	Any problem with that?
1922	Does this contract have an evergreen clause?
1923	I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to sell.

1957	Fuels from production area to M3
1958	Hey team.
1958	I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.
1958	Brenda Fletcher was asking me Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.
1958	Deal # Vol Buy/Sale Location End Term Book 592845 9189 Buy Tenn Niagara 10/31/2008 New England 223854 9189 Sale Tenn Niagara 10/31/2008 New England When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).
1958	Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.
1958	I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.
1958	Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).
1958	Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in. Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).
1958	As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.
1958	I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.
1958	Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.
1958	That's around $1,340,000.
1958	I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.
1958	Does anyone here talk to AEC?
1959	What do you guys think about the following set ups for the Egan park and loan contracts?
1959	Parking Loaning Pipe Code EGHP EGHP Firmness IT IT Service Type Interruptible Parking Service Interruptible Loaning Service Rate Schedule IPS ILS Term Term Term
1960	For the 6th, I borrowed 19,903 dth from EGHP (deal 1158684) and I must pay the all the gas back by Friday (deal 1158685).
1960	Since we are borrowing the gas first, we should path this gas on contract # EGHP IT Loaning - 001.
1960	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1961	Thanks.
1962	The end date on #21 (contract # 58654) is 4/30/2005.
1962	The demand charge on #21 and #17 is $3.145 per month.
1962	Also, ACA changed from $.0022 to $.0021 on ALL the CGLF transport.
1963	I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.
1963	For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.
1963	After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.
1963	Here are the deal numbers and volumes.
1963	Deal Current Vol After Cuts Comment 1149149 21,000 10,000 Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.

1963	Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.
1963	Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.
1963	I may be out this afternoon.
1963	I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.
1963	Thanks for your support.
1964	I told Judy she was going.
1965	Please grant the following origination to Robin from TP1, deal #1162682.
1965	thanks
1966	Lets see, stock is trading at $7.29.
1966	I believe you will see lots of folks looking for employment elsewhere.
1967	Hey girl.
1967	Who are you working for?
1967	You know all my favorite women (except for Judy) work for EnronOnline.
1968	If we are still here that is.
1968	ENE is at $7.36 - mood isn't so good.
1969	You got that right!!!
1970	maybe
1971	CGLF contract 42789 has been extended to 10/31/2002.

1977	He's not in the office today.
1977	your msn doesn't work.
1978	Thanks.
1978	I appreciate that.
1978	It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.
1978	I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.
1978	And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.
1978	But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.
1978	I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.
1979	Does this email still work or is Enron trying to control all info in and out of the building?
1980	I'm cool.
1980	How are the kitties?
1980	Ingrid is starting to expand, of course she's not as big as me yet.
1981	The TCO book is buying 1,000 dth per day from Power Gas Marketing at Trco-Young Women's Creek.
1981	Effective 11/9/01, CNG began restricting receipts from Trco-Leidy.
1981	We are taking 543 dth into CNG, VNG has 543 dth of primary receipts at Leidy on CNG.

1982	What would you have me do?
1982	Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.
1982	Talk about a change in location.
1982	I thought that was nice of him to offer though.
1982	So what do you think?
1982	Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job?
1983	Steve, I forgot to mention that we are using the Utos to Leidy contract #.6507 to flow the 6-6 volumes.
1984	I sold my CGLF to Susan today so you dont need to worry about it on Monday.
1984	I'm flat CGLF.
1985	And you thought I didn't have anything ready.
1985	I sent this to Paul yesterday, he said "I'll keep it and see were to fit you in, you should have come when I asked you to" I guess he's unhappy with me.
1986	We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new.
1986	Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months.
1986	I had a jury duty summons this morning.

1998	We moved into the new building over the weekend.
1999	And, because I waited so long, it should be done in a great big hurry!
2000	I'm wonderful thank you very much.
2000	Where have you been?
2000	How are you doing?
2001	According to my calculations, TP1 demand charges should be $1,115,826 for Nov. Would you change that for me?
2001	Thanks
2002	You lucky girl.
2002	Let tell me all the interesting stuff that's going on!!!!!!!
2003	I don't know how this asset management deal works on demand charges.
2003	Could you give me a demand charge report out of Unify please?
2004	I WANT TO GO.
2004	Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.
2004	I'm almost positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).
2004	You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat.
2005	The deal didn't go thru.
2005	sorry about that.
2006	Is there a way I can see the amount of gas on my storage contract on the EBB?
2006	I looked yesterday and I even tried the "help button" but I couldn't find anything.
2006	The contract number is 15692.
2007	Early this afternoon would be fine, say around 1:30 PM.
2007	My new location is 06456.
2007	Thanks
2008	Would you check on this when you get a chance.
2008	Let me know if I need to yell at someone.
2008	Thanks.
2009	Please grant Robin the following origination from TP1
2010	hey buddy, would it be better to sell this on sonat or tenn?
2010	The storage balance is 500,195 dth or about 16,135 dth per day.
2011	On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.
2011	I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.
2011	I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn. The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.
2011	The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?
2011	Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.
2011	Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?
2011	thanks
2012	We have the following Tenn disounts for the 22-26th even though we may not use them.
2012	Z0 to Carthage meter #010031 on k#2891 $.1022 plus fuel.
2012	Any Z1 or Z0 point to Z6-Tewksbury on k#2891 $.3522 plus fuel.
2013	Joann, is the Canajoharie volume for the Nov 13th still 23953?
2014	Gerald, it looks like the gas I sold you on the Nov 13 did not get scheduled.
2014	The volume was 2700 dth.
2014	Still checking on the 9th.
2015	Please order me a fan because I'm burning up over here.
2016	We negotiated the following discounts on Tenn and TGT Tenn - all discounts are for the 27th only.
2016	Texas Gas - discounts apply from 26th-30th.
2017	Maybe, but I know you will check my work because you are a caring individual - I don't care what everyone else says about you.
2018	Ok, I would like to go over a couple of things this afternoon if possible.
2018	I'll try to come down for 30 min or so.
2019	Hey thanks.
2019	You are sweet.
2019	Looks like that 5.25 was a great sale too.
2020	Heads up.
2020	Andy should be putting in a request to increase my volume on k#37877 to 38,500
2021	This is what I have for the East Desk.
2021	Let me know if you have questions.
2022	I forgot to send this to you on Friday Jerry Buterakos This is the turbine job we were talking about last week.
2022	Also, Dynegy has Scott Prophit's job poested on their EBB today.
2022	Its got your name all over it.
2022	I'm going to apply for it too though.
2022	Click on the link above, then select Positions by date.
2022	It's a "Trader" job posted on the 17th.
2022	Thanks for the chat, it helped.
2023	I changed your col gas password from ou1rules to clg12dec.
2024	We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.
2024	Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.
2024	Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.
2024	I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.
2024	Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.
2024	I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.
2025	I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.
2025	This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.
2025	It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.
2025	To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.
2025	But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.
2025	I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.
2025	We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.
2025	I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.
2026	This is what I have so far for Wholesale East TPort.
2026	I need to research the rest.
2027	Why don't you guys plan an evening in Houston and I'll show you the trade floor.
2027	I really prefer to do it after 5:30 these days.
2027	It doesn't have to be this week, I was just thinking about it.
2027	Maybe I'll get a free meal off of both of ya!!!!!!!!!!
2027	NO - we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at HALF NAKED BRAZILIAN WOMEN WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
2027	You are both a bad influence on me already.
2028	Steve Bennet
2029	Thanks.
2030	Sign us up.
2030	BUT, I may be WHO KNOWS WHERE sowing all my wild oats with half naked Brazilian women.
2030	I don't have that many oats left anyway, it could just be an oat.
2030	By the way, Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert.
2030	I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.
2030	I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.
2030	Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.
2030	I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.
2030	I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.
2030	Call me when you can, it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2030	Later Gator Boo BOOO
2031	Fantastic.

2040	Here is a little more info in the Tenn/Sonat park & loan deal.
2040	The volume is 500,195 dth parked in Bear Creek storage on Tenn contract 15692.
2040	It was suppossed to come out on Sonat this month but we never scheduled it.
2040	Yesterday, Clarissa Garcia tried to schedule some of this gas for today's gas day.
2040	We don't know if Tenn allowed us to schedule it yet.
2040	Summary There is only 1 Tenn park & loan deal for 500,195 2 Cgas park & loan deals shown below.
2040	We have not scheduled any of the CGAS park & loan deals.
2041	I have 2 email addresses.
2041	chris_germany61@hotmail.com <==primary email address.
2041	I know, where did I come up with a name like trogg522?
2041	My apartment is only 522 sq ft and it makes me feel like a caveman (TROGG).
2042	HEY!!!
2042	Not too much time to talk.
2042	I'm wrapping a few things up before I take the longest vacation of my life.
2042	I may not come in tomorrow.
2042	We will be there Saturday with bells on.
2042	My little woman will probably need to take a nap in the back bedroom if that's ok.
2042	Send me an email at home AND here and let me know what time to show up.
2042	Also, she wants to know if we need to bring any snack stuff.
2043	Hey, I just saw your email.
2043	I'm still here.
2043	I'm moving my stuff from 6 to 5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.
2043	I may or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.
2043	I'm probably leaving early today too.
2043	I may actually take the first week of Jan off too.
2043	How are you?
2043	I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.
2043	I'm glad you have something.
2043	Don't be upset if I don't return your email for awhile.
2043	I'll be on vacation.
2043	Later Gator
2044	I don't see you on MSN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?
2045	Terry Kain with Keyspan Energy Services is looking for a copy of their contract with ENA.
2045	I didn't ask him any questions.
2045	I just told him that someone would contact him.
2045	His number is 516-256-2611.
2046	So it was 10:00 AM and I'm about to leave, RIGHT?
2046	My new boss says go sell that storage gas.
2046	hmmm.
2046	WHAT IF THE g.D.
2046	PIPELINE WON'T LET ME SHEDULE IT?
2046	SHOULD I TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON A FRIDAY, THE FRIDAY BEFORE OUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY?
2046	HOW ABOUT ALL THEM g.D.
2046	DAYS I WAS ASKING TO CALL THE PIPELINE TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD AND WOULD NOT LET US DO?
2046	I now have work to do.
2046	I'm not going shopping until this evening.
2046	Have a nice day.
2047	I'm leaving for the day.
2047	All of my notes are on the word document.
2047	I just spoke with my contact at Columbia Gas and she suggested that we call Columbia Gas's in-house counsel to discuss the issue.
2047	I just update my word document with that information.
2047	Steve, you may receive this email before I get to your office.
2047	I will hand deliver the following items; 1.
2047	The word document attached to this email 2.
2047	Copy of the Columbia Gas PAL and FTS rate shedule from their tariff 3.
2047	Copies of the 2 PAL's contracts that ENA is trying to utilize 4.
2047	A copy of 1 of our FTS contracts 5.
2047	Select sheets from Columbia Gas's tariff that apply to Creditworthiness.
2047	Ed, I will be in on Wednesday to resolve this issue.
2047	Then I will be taking ALL OF MY 2000 vacation until it runs out, which will be sometime during the second week of Jan.
2048	ditto :) See that means I'm like Patrick Swazzie in the movie Ghost.
2048	He was way toooo macho to use the love word so he came up with an acceptable alternative.
2048	But if I die and I come back to haunt you, I won't be using the word ditto.
2048	I'll probably make reference to a Shetlon Pony.
2048	That way you will know its me.
2049	2 weeks ago, I received a page and the message box on my pager said "voicemail".
2049	Would you see if I have voicemail and if I do, how do I access it.
2049	Thanks My pager number is 877-498-5497
2050	Jared is here.
2050	I'll tell him to call you.
2051	works for me.
2051	thanks
2052	I don't see you in MSN Messenger either.
2053	Hey, what about my pager?
2054	As of 2:00 P.M., Steve has not heard from Col Gas.
2054	I will be taking my vacation through Monday, Jan 14th.
2054	I have a sneaky feeling that I may be let go before then anyway.
2054	I will be checking my voicemail everyday and my emails every other day.
2054	Also, I don't plan on being out of town for more than a day over the next 2 weeks.
2054	I may leave town a few days during the week of Jan 7th.
2055	Thanks for writing buddy.
2055	Things are going very well on the home front.
2055	Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since.
2055	I really do appreciate it.
2055	How's work at Enron?
2055	Good question.
2055	I started taking my vacation on the 27th.
2055	I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation.
2055	I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week.
2055	But then its anybodys guess these days too.
2055	I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message.
2055	There isn't anything to do at work right now.
2055	I guess we should hear something this week.
2055	How are things going with you?
2056	Where the heck is Somerset?
2056	And who cares anyway?
2056	I hope you had a happy New Year buddy.
2056	Indrid and I went to Lulling City Market over the weekend.
2056	That is without a doubt the best BBQ I have ever had.
2056	YOU DE MAN!!!!!!!!
2057	I was not in the office today.
2057	I just check my emails from home.
2057	I'm taking Matt Fleming to YOUR BBQ place next week.
2057	He hasn't found a job yet.
2057	I told him that it felt like a bunch of us estaters would be let go soon, don't know why, just a feeling.
2058	Hey woman.
2058	Have I told you what a good person you are?
2058	You're sweet.
2058	I have plans on Friday but be sure to give Dan a great big hug from ME!!!!!!
2058	And thanks for thinking of me when you sent out this email.
2058	Later Gator
2059	I received another voicemail notice on my pager yesterday afternoon.
2059	Have you had any luck with this?
2059	How about this?
2059	Do you know how long I'm going to be employed for?
2059	Any news at all?
2060	Does that fried guinea pig taste like CHICKEN???
2061	I'm at work today and I assume we are going to the boat show tonight.
2061	You just let me know.,
2062	[Germany, Chris] Hey, I went drinking last night and you weren't there.
2062	So I just talked bad about you.
2063	Just got back from and executive lunch.
2064	I need access to the following common directory.
2064	o:\Gas Structuring\
2065	I can't get whatever it was you sent me.
2065	It must be illegal or naughty.
2066	The attached worksheet has the Boston Gas contracts on Iroq and Tenn and the AEC contract on National Fuel along with all the other contracts we have on Iroq, Nat Fuel, ant Tenn. The contract number is in column P and the three contracts are highlighted in a light blue.
2067	Hey there.
2067	I'm working on your request.
2068	Ed, ENA - Canada is requesting some pricing information from me on the Boston Gas Tenn Z6 deal.
2068	I would like to talk to you before I provide this information.
2068	Thanks
2069	I forget and you are so wonderful.
2069	Who do I talk to about capacity release?
2070	Steve Menke said you would know the answer.
2070	I purchased capacity from Steve last October.
2070	The terms were as follows; Release Date 11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002 Contract T0181230000 Offer #200110000095 Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.
2070	Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.
2070	Thanks
2071	This one is easy, Texas Gas k#T018123 was recalled effective 12/14/01.
2072	Hey woman!
2072	What are you doing talking to my pregnant chic?
2072	I going to tell her that anything bad you said about me is a lie.
2072	AND YES, all I do is goof off.
2072	What else is there to do?
2072	How's your boy doing?
2072	How are the cats?
2072	How's the job?
2072	How old are you?
2073	Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you constantly rejected my advances.
2073	AND I DO provide her with love and support.
2073	I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".
2073	We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.
2073	Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.
2073	We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.
2073	I'm still trying to make her cat disappear.
2073	I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.
2074	Yep.
2074	We went for and ultra sound last Thursday and the doc asked "do you want to know what the sex is?"
2074	I said YES and she said NO and the doc said ok we won't look.
2075	I just received a call from Carol Taylor at National Fuel.
2075	She told me that contract B00693-038181 was recalled effective 1/1/2002.
2075	This was capacity we received from AEC - one of those producer netback deals.
2076	What the heck are you doing?
2076	I know you miss me asking you dumb questions every once in a while.
2076	I'm still here, at Enron that is.
2076	Maybe I'll call you up and hassle you later.
2077	Ain't that the truth.
2077	Wait just a minute, I took Monday off and I think I'm taking Friday of next week off.
2077	Never mind.
2078	Now I remember!!!
2078	Do you just need IT contracts on pipes with firm transport or it on all pipelines?
2078	Who is Rita?
2079	Have we flowed any IT transport on the East Desk pipelines for the month of January?
2079	I think the answer is no but I wanted to double check?
2079	If we did, then I need to know the pipeline, contract number and probably the volume.
2079	Thanks.
2080	Hey there, I need the IT contract numbers please.
2080	Thanks
2081	I have one more person that I'm waiting on and Kathy is going to work on it after lunch.
2082	Boo
2083	Last Boo from me.
2084	Thanks buddies and buddettes.
2084	I may bring yall some scheduler treats if I make it in on Monday.
2084	Then again I may just forget but remember I love you all.
2085	Just so you don't forget me.
2085	I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.
2085	I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.
2085	Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.
2085	I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.
2085	Tom would like an answer by Monday.
2085	Let me know.
2085	Thanks
2086	HEY GIRL.
2086	It's so good to hear from you.
2086	Let's see, I'm still here.
2086	I work on the estate team which means I work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave.
2086	My buddy Goodell is will be working for NewCo (The New Company - is this original or what).
2086	They should find out something in the next couple of days I think.
2086	Other than that its just hand around and see what happens.
2086	So did you make good grades?
2086	What's that report card looking like.
2086	How's the hubby?
2086	You still in love or what?
2087	I think this is funny.
2087	I believe Enron laid off some incredibly talented people.
2087	Gloria might like this.
2088	I've been waiting for an opportunity to speak with you but it appears that you have been very involved.
2088	Daren Farmer works for Tom Martin on the Texas Desk upstairs.
2088	Daren just accepted a position with AEP and Tom asked me if I would be interested in Daren's position.
2088	I told him I would and I asked him to touch base with you.
2089	HEY WOMAN!!!!
2089	What the heck are you doing?
2089	I did make it back.
2089	I actually came in most of last week.
2089	I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment.
2089	I have this strong urge to go out and spend money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now.
2089	We don't really know much about the New Company right now.
2089	I'm actually on the estate team anyway.
2089	I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon, Sylvia Pollen, Robin Barbe, and Kathy Kelly.
2089	The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won.
2089	I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.
2089	I think I know of a couple of people that have left; David Jones (black guy in origination - real nice guy too) starts working for TXU in Dallas today, Darren Farmer (Texas Desk) is going to AEP.
2090	We don't have a deadline.
2090	Our lawyers are scattered pretty thin.
2090	What would probably happen is that you guys might show me a bid for some of the capacity, then we would have to talk to the pipelines and see what they want to do.
2091	#67401 and #70457 are the correct contracts.
2091	#67401 was intended to come out in Dec and #70457 was intended to come out in Jan.
2092	Wait just a minute.
2092	Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite?
2092	Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!
2092	YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!
2092	We are poorer than college students now.
2092	I think you should send us an invite anyway.
2092	Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.
2092	At least I could get drunk.
2092	So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?
2092	I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.
2092	Those are fantastic grades.
2092	You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.
2092	I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?
2092	MBA?
2092	Its good to hear about Alicia.
2092	Is she going to grad school?
2092	I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.
2092	We move in together at the end of Feb. I'm nervous about that.
2092	I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.
2092	I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.
2092	I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.
2093	I have a copy of what's in the files we made before the holidays.
2094	This is my beautiful transport worksheet for Uncle Frenchy.
2094	What do you think?
2095	Yes I will.
2095	You are my hero.
2095	I suppose I can do the title transfer in Brazoria county on Friday right?
2096	Here is a funny right back at you.
2096	This is what I plan on doing to my kid when it gets here in May.
2096	I'm also going to duct tape its little hands just for fun too.
2097	Thanks.
2097	So far so good but I'm too damn old to be a dad.
2098	You want to work out the title transfer with them.
2098	979-798-8715 This is my beautiful transport worksheet for Uncle Frenchy.
2098	What do you think?
2099	When are you coming to town to visit me?
2099	What do you do all day?
2099	What's going on in the world out there?
2100	Do you know if Bruce McDaniels still works at Virginia Power?
2101	Did it show my phone number and what services I offer?
2102	I need to verify your fax number please.

2106	I just got a call from the guy that asked me to work on the Texas Desk.
2106	He just eliminated my position and I think he may be making another cut or two as well.
2107	Hey you crazy girl, there is nothing here to look at.
2108	Just a note, the colors at work are different than the colors at home.
2108	Good photo though.
2108	Now that I've started the process, I'm going to add other pregnant Immer photo's.
2109	Photo of my woman on the net.
2110	FYI
2111	Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express.
2111	The cover letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts.
2111	I'm sending you a copy of the letter.
2111	I assume that we will not be paying any of the invoice.
2111	Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans?
2111	Thanks
2112	I just tried to call you and no one anwsered the phone.
2112	I was going to hassle you before I leave.
2112	My appt is at 2:45, I'll probably leave at 1:45 ish.
2112	Its up on 1960.
2112	I was going to work out then come over and take you to dinner.
2112	What do you think?
2113	Does Johnny Trimble work up there with you?
2113	I just heard his name and I'm curious.
2113	Have you ever heard of Jeff Hammond?
2114	Guess what?
2114	My buddy at dinergy said Mike couldn't talk to me if I'm still employed by Enron.
2114	I'm going to call him anyway just to say hello.
2115	Looks like I'm gonna try BIAXIN XL 500 mg tablets.
2115	Are you really cute today?
2116	Ok, were you cute a dinner last nite when you had alfredo sauce all over your chin?
2117	I just wanted to drop in and see what your desk looks like...

2120	I'm off tomorrow.
2120	What are we doing?
2120	Selling my Dad's wares and making a fortune?
2121	I have these 2 contracts highlighted in yellow and coded as Agency/Release.
2121	They probably should just be release but I'll let you decide.
2122	This is very interesting.
2122	It doesn't sound legal unless SIGCORP agreed to pay for November upfront.
2122	Thanks for the info.
2123	Thanks.
2123	I think Susan Weison has been all over.
2124	I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning.
2124	GOOD NEWS.
2124	I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous.
2124	Enron is, in part, the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets.
2124	It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers.
2124	I know what it means.
2124	And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!!!
2125	Guess what?
2125	I have you nameplate.
2125	I'm gonna take it home and cherish it forever.
2126	Life couldn't be better.
2126	I have absolutly nuthin to do and I'm getting paid for it.
2126	Kinda makes for a long day.
2126	How are you?
2126	Been partying latley?
2126	Married yet?
2126	How's the dog?
2126	Give Steve a big kiss for me!!
2127	He is officially a scheduler now.
2127	This is how the East Desk fared.
2127	Scott Neal, Judy, Chuck - associate, Andy Rind, Sandra Brawner, Brad McKay, John McKay.
2127	Frank Vickers, Craig Taylor, Jared.
2127	Scheduling - Victor, Clarissa, Chris Ordway, Meredith, Scott Goodell.
2127	Vickie and Scott Loving were moved to the estate team.
2127	If you didn't get a job offer you are considered part of the estate team.
2128	Opps, he's UBS too.
2129	Do you have the file sharing set up yet?
2129	And there is one contract on the East Desk that expires 1/31/2002 that we will need to turn back very soon I guess.
2130	I'm an estate person.
2130	Nobody at UBS wants me.
2131	Lunch on Friday sounds great.
2131	Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy.
2131	He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from Enron and an offer letter from Dynegy.
2131	Maybe I'll see you there!!!
2131	A fellow can always hope.
2131	Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either.
2131	I bet she doesn't marry me now.
2132	We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.
2132	The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.
2132	The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.
2132	Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?
2132	To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.
2133	My contact at Tennessee, Sherry Noack, said she doesn't see any problem with us releasing the Tenn Boston Gas capacity.
2133	Iroq pretty much said the same thing last week but I will verify that again after lunch.
2134	And to buy my g.d.
2134	ring?
2135	Here is a picture of my pregnant woman on the net.
2135	I'll being adding more pictures this week.
2135	Make sure you scroll down and read the comments at the bottom.
2136	The person at Select Nat Gas interested in the Trailblazer capacity is Calvin Schultz, phone number 303-797-3388.
2137	FYI
2138	My ICE id and password no longer work.
2138	They worked on Dec 26th.
2138	Does yours still work?
2139	Grier Martin with El Paso Merchant Energy called - he's interested in the Trailblazer capacity.
2139	His number is 713-420-5673.
2140	Hey buddy.
2140	I'm looking for a Boston Gas contract and I thought you might have a copy of it.
2140	Its the involving 35,000 dth of transport on Iroq and Tenn. Don't look to hard for it but if you do have it, just let me know and I'll come make a copy.
2140	Thanks I've already gone through Maureen's desk and she didn't have a copy.
2141	Please give Ruth access to o:\Gas Structuring\Bankruptcy Folder\Transportation Thanks
2142	thanks
2143	Please give the same access to Kim and Jeanne.
2143	Thanks.
2144	Hey team!
2144	Man have I been waiting for this day.
2144	I have a meeting at 9:00 AM this morning.
2144	It's a meeting with lawyers so it is very possible that it will go through lunch.
2144	Don't wait for me if you can't get ahold of me.
2144	I hope to be there cause I wanna see JEAN, the light of my life.
2144	Scott--- HANDS OFF JACK!
2144	Later
2145	I know, life is all about choices, Jean or lawyers, Jean or lawyers, Jean or Ingrid and a screaming kid???
2145	Hmm, my choice seems much simpler now that I look at it like this.
2146	I'm back and I'm gong.
2146	My MSN doesn't work.
2146	What time should I come to your desk?
2147	Just heard from Robin.
2147	Sad stuff.
2147	My MSN doesn't work.
2148	Russell is going to RWE.
2149	I would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible.
2149	Plus it make me feel like I'm doing part of the work.
2149	I just might come up and spend the night tonight.
2149	Be there around 10:30 or 11.
2150	Funny.
2150	No. I didn't feel guilty about the garage sale, that's why I was annoyed - being notified at 10:00 at night GRRRRRRR.
2150	I do feel guilty about you doing all this work.
2150	So I'm going with you, I pay for the gas and the twinkies.
2151	Maybe we can go drinking too.
2151	That would be fun.
2151	I'll be at your house around 10:30 or 11 tonight.
2152	Cullen and Dykman (attorneys for Boston Gas Company) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas.
2152	They also made one other change, they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1.
2152	They will be sending the revised document to me.
2152	I will deliver it to you for your approval.
2153	A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world.
2153	Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War.
2153	She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands.
2153	She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives.
2153	Ms. Walters approached one of the women and said, "This is marvelous. Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?"
2153	"Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman.
2154	Steve, everything looks good with one exception.
2154	The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284.
2154	I won't find out until Monday.
2154	You review and approve it, keep it on your desk, and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday.
2154	Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval.
2154	By the way, Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray.
2155	Don't forget about me.
2155	I'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement.
2155	No transportation at this point, just a tabs.
2155	Also, it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly.
2156	Jared, Ruth and I are going to go over all the Florida activity tomorrow morning.
2156	If no one objects, I will be the lead coordinator on Florida starting tomorrow.
2157	Yes maam, she's UBS now.
2157	She was just down here too.
2158	Jared just told me you have a BUNCH of stuff on your plate and I think you are about to get much busier too.
2159	She is now.
2159	I don't think she had a choice.
2160	I heard that El Paso had cuts on Friday.
2160	Did that impact you guys at all?
2161	I just validated and saved this release to Boston Gas.
2161	Since I have not done this in awhile, would you please make sure I did the following things?
2161	Released 100% of the volume biddable to Boston Gas and max rate.
2161	I will wait to hear from you before I submit my offer.
2161	Thanks.
2162	Also, I'm using Scott Goodell's ID because my doesn't work.
2162	Who do I call to get mine fixed?
2162	I know - you told me once before.
2162	I'm a baaaad person.
2163	I think so.
2163	Probably some people in satellite offices too.
2163	I heard it was mostly originators and middle marketers.
2164	FYI - We just posted the capacity release to Boston Gas.
2164	I created a biddable offer per Boston Gas's request.
2164	This deal is for the month of Feb only.
2165	FYI - meeting to discuss Florida issues before Jared goes away forever.
2165	Scott - didn't know if you should be at this meeting as well.
2165	Daniel, you did schedule the room for Tuesday, Jan 29th, correct?
2166	Eric and Ed are in a Keyspan meeting at 9:00 AM.
2166	Would it be possible to move this meeting to a later time today?
2167	sniff sniff.
2167	I'm gonna miss you guys.
2167	Think of me everytime you get a HUG!!
2167	sniff sniff.
2167	Throw me some crumbs when you see me on the street.
2168	Good.
2168	Glad to hear it.
2168	We are going to try and meet at 10:00 this morning.
2168	Jared is still in traffic right now anyway.
2169	Ed McMichael has signed the agreement.
2169	One minor change, I replaced all "FT-A"'s with "NET-284".
2169	I will fax a copy to your attention.
2169	Also, does this need to be sent to you via over night mail?
2169	Thanks
2170	Ed has signed off on the agreement you gave me yesterday evening.
2170	Should I send this straight to Boston Gas's outside counsel or should I send it to Melanie Gray?
2171	Guess what.
2171	I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.
2171	I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.
2171	Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.
2171	They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.
2171	I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.
2171	I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!
2172	I wonder if you guys can attend these sessions as UBS?
2173	Oh girl I know I do.
2173	I'm very modest too.
2174	I'm at my new desk on the 4th floor.
2174	I'm here, my computer is here, but it looks like my phone has not been activated.
2174	So I don't know when I'll be able to call and aggravate you.
2174	Email aggravations just aren't the same.
2174	Please try to think of some of our old conversations, especially those where you would look up and to the left uttering "oh my GOD!".
2175	Looks like my computer is working, not real well but it is working.
2175	I have my phone now too.
2176	Oh yeah, whatever you want deal.
2176	I am completly indifferent.
2176	Whatever makes you happy.
2177	I asked Victor about the files.
2177	I think keeping it on your h drive is still a good idea for now.
2178	I can vaugly remember you calling me about Unify.
2178	Do I have Unify Estate access?
2178	If yes, do you know my ID and password?
2178	If no, how do I get it?
2178	Thanks
2179	Robin Barbe is a Northeast originator and I'm sure she will be interested too.
2179	Remember, steak dinner for the WINNER!!!!!
2180	Hey woman.
2180	I need your phone number and Steve's phone number and John's phone number and Tammy's phone number please.
2181	Update: ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.
2181	Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.
2181	Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.
2181	Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.
2181	This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.
2181	Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.
2182	I think this will do for now.
2182	I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me.
2182	I was so sad and heartbroken.
2182	Baby's doing good.
2182	Woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now.
2182	I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat.
2182	What do you think?
2182	We keep loosing people.
2182	Christina is moving to the Estate Team power dispatch group.
2182	Good for her.
2182	That will make her in expendable.
2182	how the heck are you?
2183	Looks like it works.
2183	Thanks.
2184	Nothing so far.
2184	Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.
2184	It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.
2184	I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.
2184	I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.
2184	Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.
2184	Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.
2185	Interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to CES which was assigned (not via capacity release) to ENA.
2185	FYI, demand charge = $2.6614 per month = $.0875 per dth and the commodity is $.0136 100% load factor cost = $.1639
2186	ok, I see Russel and Chucks touch all through this.
2187	I'm busy that day.
2187	JUST KIDDING>
2188	Margaret I've attached the prepayment request.
2188	The physical address for the bank is Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company C/O Bank Of America File #96264 840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor Chicago, IL 60693 The address of the company we are doing business is Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company Nine Greenway Plaza The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
2188	The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.
2188	Eric, Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.
2188	I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.
2189	Who do I talk to over there about buying gas on Florida in Zone 2?
2189	And it was very nice to see you today.
2190	Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.
2190	I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.
2190	The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.
2190	ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.
2190	Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.
2190	Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.
2191	scheduling contacts.
2192	Same as before.
2192	We should have another supplier set up by the end of the day.
2192	The calculation for the prepay is 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 for gas flow on 2/5/02 on Tenn contract 2891.
2193	Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.
2193	My trading contact is Jim Taylor (713-207-1482).
2193	The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.
2193	Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.
2193	I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form.
2193	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2193	Thanks
2194	Please use bank account number 8188202747 for the wire to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (subsidiary of El Paso).
2194	Ted with El Paso's corporate credit department said this account number is good.
2194	Call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.
2194	Thanks Chris Germany
2195	Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th.
2195	He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs.
2195	Jim would like to meet for lunch, HIS TREAT, one day.
2195	Of course he doesn't want to meet me, he wants to see Judy P. But the boy is smart, he knows that the best way to see Judy P. for lunch is to invite me.
2195	See there, you are still a benefit to me.
2195	So how about Thursday?
2196	I just got to work about 10 min ago.
2196	Key Lay has resigned from the Board of Directors.
2196	I brought in those chocolate hearts and passed them out to my little group.
2196	I told the guys that I DO discriminate because I gave all the guys 1 chocolate and all the girls 2 chocolates.
2196	How's your day?
2197	Pete, I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
2197	In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant.
2197	However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.
2197	Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.
2197	I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.
2197	Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.
2197	Thanks Chris Germany Manager, Gas Trading
2198	Here is our unofficial Tennessee invoice for January.
2199	Another prepay to Tennessee.
2199	The calculation for the prepay is 2,000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20.
2200	Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable.
2200	Kay, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract.
2200	I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU.
2200	We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.
2200	Doug, Phil, Eric, The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead.
2200	We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract.
2200	Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.
2201	Thanks, I have sent this to my legal department.
2202	I thought yesterday was going to be our last day but now I think today is it.
2202	This has turned out to be very frustrating
2203	I have 2 prepays in this email.
2203	We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.
2203	Note to all The first prepay is to TXU.
2203	I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.
2203	The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.
2203	If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.
2203	This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.
2203	I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.
2203	My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.
2203	I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.
2203	Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.
2203	However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.
2203	So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.
2203	We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.
2204	Same thing as yesterday.
2204	I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.
2204	I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room.
2204	You should have received this yesterday afternoon.
2204	Thanks
2205	These are my notes on flowing gas.
2205	Tetco will be the problem pipeline.
2205	I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.
2205	I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.
2205	I'm using the following formula They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.
2205	It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.
2205	I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.
2205	If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.
2205	Who knows what volumes are going to be?
2206	This is what someone created for Sequent.
2206	I plan on doing something similar for Reliant and TXU.
2206	Call me after you get this and we can chat.
2207	Look what I found in my inbox.
2208	Iroquois is offering to market ENA's capacity for $1.00 (see attachements at the bottom of this email).
2208	Doesn't sound like a bad deal to me
2209	i hope to quit before that becomes an issue.
2209	one can only hope.
2210	How do I get Jim Taylor added as a contact at Reliant Energy Services, Inc. in sitara?
2211	Who do I call to get my palm hooked up to my computer?
2211	I have the palm cradle sitting on my desk.
2212	I found a mistake in my capacity worksheet.
2212	The term on the Boston Gas capacity, contract 125008, 35,465 MDQ, is 12/1/1998 - 3/31/2007.
2212	I think have the ending date as 2008.
2213	Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?
2213	I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.
2213	It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.
2213	Just let me know.
2214	Following are the contract terms for Iroquois and Tennessee.
2214	I am more interested in getting numbers on Iroq contract 1250-05.
2214	I believe we should not consider releasing the capacity for any term less than a year.
2214	Pipeline Iroquois Rate Schedule RTS12 Receipt Point Waddington Delivery Point South Commack Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 10/31/2006 Pipeline Iroquois Rate Schedule RTS1 Receipt Point Waddington Delivery Point Tennessee Wright Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 3/31/2007 Pipeline Tennessee Rate Schedule Net 284 Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 3/31/2001
2215	Wade called Eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then Wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts.
2215	I was working on something else and I just asked Wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about.
2215	Wade actually called Eric.
2216	Tennessee requires a pepayment or LC in the amount of $25,000.00 per SA pool.
2216	For the Keyspan deal, that essentially means we would need $25,000.00 of credit for each point, 500L, 800L, and Zone 0 = $75,000.00 total.
2217	I echatted with Dan.
2217	He said the number is 212-398-6300 and HE THINKS the name of the person is Allen Fuchs.
2218	I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.
2218	I'm making the following assumptions; 1.
2218	ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002 2.
2218	Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months 3.
2218	Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day So far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.
2218	I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.
2218	The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.
2218	Phil, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.
2218	Sounds good to me.
2218	This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant, our current cash balance with Reliant, how much gas we have purchased, and what price we used.
2218	I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week.
2218	I also plan to copy Phil, Robin, and Margaret.
2218	This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls Eric, Doug, Phil, let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday.
2219	Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.
2219	I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.
2219	This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.
2219	My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.
2219	My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.
2219	We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.
2219	So please try to get the wire out today.
2219	Thanks
2220	Jim Attached is my worksheet showing our daily activity and prepayments.
2220	I would like to send this worksheet to you 2 or 3 times a week.
2220	Let me know if you agree with all the information.
2220	We can also change the format.
2220	I will be out of the office on Monday so Robin Barbe will be calling you.
2220	Her number is 713-853-7177.
2220	Also, we originally intended to wire more money to Reliant on Monday but we are trying to wire the money today due to the increase in prices.
2220	I will keep you posted and I will update the schedule for any prepayments made today.
2220	Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3037
2221	ENA is wiring Reliant $20,000.00 today at 3:30 PM.
2221	My goal is to send Reliant a wire every Thursday that will cover all ENA purchases for the next 7 days.
2221	Jim, your contact on Monday will be Robin Barbe.
2221	Her number is 713-853-7177.
2221	Thanks everyone and have a good weekend.
2221	Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3037
2222	I adjusted my schedule to reflect higher prices and the wire scheduled to go out at 3:30 PM today.
2222	Did I mention what wonderful people we have working in settlements?
2222	WELL THEY ARE!!!!
2222	Thanks TEAM.
2223	I'm out Monday, Feb 11th.
2223	I'm just cleaning up my apartment, getting ready for the big move.
2223	My pager number is 877-498-5497 if anyone needs me or JUST WANTS TO TALK.
2223	Do not leave a voicemail on my pager like Eric does, I don't have the code to check voicemails.
2223	Robin Barbe will talk to Jim Taylor at Reliant on Monday.
2223	Jim Taylor's number is 713-207-1482.
2223	We should have enough money at Reliant to cover purchases through Friday of next week.
2223	Robin, Christina will let you know if Tallahassee calls on the gas.
2224	I spoke with all the following personally about the Trailblazer capacity Kevin at e prime Greg at Dominion Calvin at Select Greg Hood at Oxy Steve at BP The only person I had to leave a voicemail for is Grier at El Paso.
2224	His number is 713-420-5673.
2224	You may have already touched base with him.
2224	If not, you may want to call him on Monday, I will be out.
2224	later
2225	Hey!
2225	Congradulations on getting that new phone number.
2225	I knew you could do it.
2225	Would you ask Gerald Gilbert to call me when he gets a chance?
2225	My number is 713-853-4743.
2225	Thanks
2226	I would like for you to get 3 or 4 bids for the Iroq Zone 2 capacity.
2226	And later, I may ask you to get bids for the Iroq/Tenn capacity.
2227	That would be great if you could tell me.
2227	I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.
2227	I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.
2227	Let me know.
2227	You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days.
2228	Sorry about the email I just sent at 10:49 AM.
2228	Attached is my new schedule reflecting no gas flow on the 9th and 10th.
2229	Let me know if you want to be added to this distribution list.
2229	I should only send this list out 2 or 3 times a week now that we have a process down.
2230	Hopefully just once a week, every Thursday.
2231	Guess what?
2231	I just hired some mover to move me next week.
2231	Indrid keep telling me that you and I have bad backs and don't need to fool with moving furniture.
2231	So, I hired movers.
2231	They are charging me $60 hour and I figure 3 hours max.
2232	37147 IPP agreement - our pooling contract.
2232	39149 AS agreement - 66917 AS agreement - I think the AS agreements are aggregation supply and I believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing.
2232	I not 100% sure so I left a message for our CGAS contact to verify.
2233	Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.
2233	CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production.
2234	Hey team.
2234	I would like to release the Iroq and Tenn capacity for March activity to Boston Gas by the end of the week if possible.
2234	Please let me know by Thur morning if I should wait until next week.
2234	Thanks
2235	Who would have this info?
2235	And it might be a good thing for me to add to the schedule.
2235	Thanks
2236	Good idea.
2236	I'm checking on it and I might add this info to the worksheet.
2237	I'm trying to get in touch with Gerald Gilbert.
2237	He started working there on 2/1 I think.
2237	You may not know him but if you do, ask him to call me at 713-853-4743.
2237	Thanks
2238	thanks
2239	This prepay amount is on Phil's cash flow worksheet.
2239	I'm requesting $26,000.00 to be wired to Reliant tomorrow and currently estimating $36,000.00 to be wired next Thursday.
2240	you don't have one here.
2241	What bears?
2242	Here is the info and I'm putting a copy of the agreement in interoffice mail to you.
2242	Shawn Kirkpatrick Contract Analyst Reliant Energy Services, Inc. Phone: 713-207-6569 Fax: 713-393-0212
2243	Also, please let me know what the global contract number is.

2244	Hey woman!
2244	Things are going good, ok at work, better at home.
2244	Not too too busy but I'm actually doing stuff.
2244	Well, this is my last weekend as a lone bachelor.
2244	NONO, we aren't getting married, yet.
2244	I move out of my little 522 sq ft cubby hole into a 2 bedroom in her apartment complex.
2244	She moves into it on the 22nd.
2244	Ahhhhh the good life.
2244	I knew it couldn't last forever.
2244	I getting ready for some fighting too.
2244	We have 3 TV's.
2244	What's wrong with a TV in each bedroom?????
2244	I tell you we are gonnnnnna fight!@# How are things with you?
2245	Ok, since I have not seen or heard from you, I'm tossing you nameplate.
2245	Maybe my woman will let me put it up in the bedroom, the one we are moving into on Monday.
2246	Robin needs a back doctor recomendation.
2246	Who do you think she should see?
2247	You still don't understand how things work.
2247	You are suppossed to always have that info at my beck and call.
2248	let me go buy some ammo.
2248	let's see, which gun do i use?????
2249	I just received a copy of the executed Reliant agreement today.
2249	Do you want a copy?
2250	Hey there.
2250	I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.
2250	Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.
2250	I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.
2250	thanks.
2251	Congratulations.
2251	Of course I won't be able to give you any more candy on valentine's day.
2251	But maybe someone over there will take care of that.
2252	Any news on this?
2253	ENA did not purchase any gas for the weekend or Tuesday (Monday is an Enron holiday).
2253	Have a good weekend!
2254	Thanks, you too.
2254	How do I get my fax number changed in the contract?
2254	My current fax number is 713-646-3037.
2255	Phil, I will drop my wire amount for Thursday if Tallahassee does not call on the gas next week.
2255	I need to research how much gas Tallahassee has taken in the past on the swing contract.
2256	I finally got a response on the wire information.
2256	You should be getting a call from Ramona Rodriquez in our Treasury department.
2256	Let me know if you don't hear from her.
2256	Thanks Chris
2257	The gentleman interested in our Florida space is Henry Barth with FPL Energy Services (the retail group, separate from the group Mike Jessop works for).
2257	His number is 561-694-4057.
2258	Bob Crites at El Paso Merchant Energy is interested in the Florida capacity as well.
2258	I don't know how he relates to Grier Martin's group.
2258	Bob's number is 713-420-2499.
2259	This would be for gas ENA purchased from Sonat.
2259	It's not transport related.
2260	POINTY HEAD!!!!!!
2260	I KNEW IT!
2260	Poor little fella.
2260	I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.
2260	I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.
2260	Talk about space, I GOT IT!
2260	For now anyway.
2260	Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.
2260	Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.
2260	I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.
2260	Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.
2260	The apartment is still pretty empty.
2260	I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.
2260	I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....
2261	I'm moving into my new hugh apartment with my first roommate - have not had a roommate since March 1996.
2262	I need Sitara access to all gas regions.
2262	I'm trying to look at some of the Central Desk activity and I don't have authorization.
2262	We might as well give me access to all ENA gas positions and the ability to create/update Sitara tickets for all gas regions.
2263	I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat.
2263	For TCO, I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by Dan Junek at AES at 9:45 AM, $.125.
2263	Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002.
2263	For Feb 2002, Henry Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99, ($.04).
2263	At 10:00 AM, NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36
2264	I printed this out and gave it to Doug.
2264	My revised prepay amount for Thur is $10,000.00.
2265	I've requested a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be sent tomorrow and I have that on my schedule.
2266	You are most welcome.
2267	Make Jim Taylor take you out to lunch sometime.
2268	You need to get on the email distribution for this.
2268	I get emails from them every day.
2269	I would like to have access to the following directory.
2269	It has the actual Gas Daily prices loaded into excel files.
2269	I'm not sure who you have to ask but they may not let me have it.
2269	The directory is o:TDS/TDS Curve/East/ Let me know.
2269	Thanks
2270	Wade, 2 things, do you have any of the letters that the producers sent to Dominion, I would like one of those AND who are you talking to at Dominion?
2270	Thanks
2271	That's fine.
2271	I don't need AEP.
2272	Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.
2272	I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.
2272	I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.
2272	I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.
2272	But, maybe you can help.
2272	My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.
2272	So he's either at UBS or he left the company.
2272	Do you know who I should be approving that now?
2272	Thanks
2273	I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.
2273	I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.
2273	I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.
2273	Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.
2273	We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.
2273	Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.
2273	Following are my calculations Estimated payment due 2/28/02 $366,554 As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.
2273	Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.
2273	I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.
2274	Robin is having back surgery next Thursday, Feb 28th.
2274	She went to a neurosurgeon for a second opinion, Dr. Alfonso Aldama was her second opinion dude..
2274	Dr. Esses, my second opinion dude, is an orthopedic surgeon.
2274	And Dr.Alani, the guy I went to see first was an orthopedic surgeon.
2274	Robin said I should go to a neurosurgeon.
2274	What do you think?
2275	The file you guys sent is July 2001!!
2275	Let me know what rates you are looking at.
2275	We didn't keep all of them updated and GRI changed effective 1/1/2002.
2275	I did make some updates to this file.
2275	Also, I only have rates for East Desk pipelines.
2276	I am still having trouble but I don't know if its and Enron problem or an Iroquois problem.
2276	I'm waiting to hear form Iroquois.
2276	I would like you to check it out if you have time this morning.
2277	anytime monday morning is fine with me, EXCEPT, i need to be at my desk around 9:00 AM to serve the Tallahassee deal.
2277	It only takes about 5 min though
2278	Updated schedule through Monday, Feb 25th.
2279	Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.
2279	This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.
2279	Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.
2279	I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.
2279	Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.
2279	Thanks
2280	Daniel, please get us a conference room for 30 min Monday afternoon and email everyone with the details.
2280	Eric, you don't need to be there, I'm just keeping you in the loop.
2281	never mind
2282	According to Iroq the problem is on our side.
2282	Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.
2282	Following is the address that I'm starting at.
2282	I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.
2282	It should ask me for my ID and password.
2282	I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.
2282	I'm out for the rest of the day.
2282	Thanks
2283	According to Kay Mann, Shemin may not be here until late afternoon.
2284	I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.
2284	I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.
2284	I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.
2285	I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.
2285	There are volumes all over the place.
2285	I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.
2285	Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.
2285	I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.
2285	Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?
2286	Do you have a deal number for this gas?
2287	Could you tell me who in legal is assigned to this?
2287	thanks
2288	Hi team.
2288	I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.
2288	We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.
2288	I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.
2288	I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.
2288	Should I set up anyone else with an ID?
2289	oh no, i insist that you do it since you started the process.
2289	i'm such a laggard.
2290	I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!
2290	We spent our first night together Friday night.
2290	Of course we both have colds / allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience.
2290	It will take some getting used to thats for sure.
2290	She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her pregnant heart.
2291	I did have those set up pretty quick.
2292	I know.
2292	I'm gong to recommend zeroing out the deal in sitara under "expected volumes".
2293	I have an id - what kind of form are you talking about?
2294	I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.
2294	On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.
2294	The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.
2294	We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.
2294	Following are my calculations Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==> $280,306.00 There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.
2294	Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?
2295	FYI, I'm sure these are not in the system yet but will be soon.
2296	Just a reminder that we still need to discuss the physical deals with volumes in the sitara for March.
2296	You said we were going to talk to Bob Hall about that today.
2297	Congratulations!!
2297	I would walk over and hassle your "MAN" but I don't see him.
2298	Thanks for your help.
2298	Now go find me a job.
2299	Judy's Rob works at Lasco in Sugarland.

2304	I'm available anytime except around 9:00 AM every morning.
2305	Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.
2305	Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.
2305	According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.
2305	Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".
2305	The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.
2305	Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!
2305	So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.
2305	Before I sell the gas, I will 1.
2305	verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 2.
2305	make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
2305	Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.
2305	Are there any special tax issues to address?
2305	Any comments or questions?
2305	Listed below are some of the companies ENA has done business with at Dawn AEP Energy Services, Inc. Aquila Canada Corp. BP Canada Energy Company Cargill Energy Trading Canada, Inc.

2310	I am changing the following deal tickets in Sitara for March 2002.
2310	I'm still not sure what to do about all the volumes showing up in Sitara for non-active deals.
2310	Counterparty Sitara Pipeline Comment Midland Cogen 332163 PEPL Changed volume from 0 to 5,000 per day Midland Cogen 340362 TRKL Changed volume form 0 to 6,800 per day
2311	Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.
2311	My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).
2311	Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.
2312	Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.
2312	I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.
2312	But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.
2313	yes sir
2314	Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.
2314	We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.
2314	You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
2314	Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.
2314	I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.
2315	Joe Van Zandt with Dominion Field Services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first.
2315	Their are 3 fixed price deals and 1 Index + $.10 deal.
2315	I can't find the deals in the system.
2315	What should I tell him legally besides NO?
2316	I would like to set up a GISB agreement to trade with Sempra.
2316	Could you send me one to send to Sempra please?
2316	Thanks
2317	I took 1/2 day off Thur 21st and Fri 22nd.
2318	This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it.
2318	I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.
2318	I actually think a summary thingy, sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week, would be easier to look at.
2318	Give me your thoughts.
2319	done
2320	FYI: Pipeline name change.
2320	Not sure who this might impact.
2320	At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline.
2320	There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM.
2321	Enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow.
2321	They have been sending us and invoice each month.
2321	I'll get back to you.
2321	I just know we owe money on this and I hope its not more than what we are making on the deal.
2322	I'm actully working on this.
2322	I should have it done tomorrow or Monday.
2322	Thanks
2323	I need your expertise.
2323	If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.
2323	So I just need to verify with you we TOOK this gas by nominating it.
2323	Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.
2323	thanks
2324	Ed is asking me if we followed up or if we need to follow up.
2324	Please let me know.
2324	I am also going to send you an email of the letter we sent to Tallahassee.
2325	I still am unable to get into the EBB.
2325	Did the capacity get awared to Boston Gas?
2326	Wonder where I should go to lunch today?
2326	Maybe the BOOOOOFEEEEEET!!!
2327	Sounds like a pizza night to me.
2328	of course, its my perrrrogative to changemy mind and go burger hopping.
2329	FYI, I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend.
2329	I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet.
2330	I hope I have the right Bob Hall.
2330	I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.
2330	I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.
2330	Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.
2330	I also left a message for the help desk about this.
2331	Goodell want phone numbers for the following WIlliams people.
2331	Jon Warzel in Tulsa Thomas Coleman in Atlanta
2332	Update schedule through 3/4/02.
2332	Have a good weekend!
2333	Bernie said he has given Ed all the file locations and such.
2333	I asked him to email you and I anything he thinks important.
2334	I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab.
2334	Now, I go to and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen.
2334	Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen.
2334	And this is where I used to get an error message, now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded.
2335	U de MAN.
2335	thanks
2336	I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.
2336	AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP (tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.
2336	AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.
2336	AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not.
2337	I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213.
2337	I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either.
2337	I just asked for everything to cover all the bases.
2338	Cash till Williams does a little better.
2338	I'm swinging back to pizza now.
2339	The tariff sheets do not line up on the page so well, I did a cut and paste.
2339	You should see the following sheets No Comment File 28B PAL Rates CGAS_PAL_rates.doc 227-229 Rate schedule CGAS_PAL_Tariff.doc
2340	I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.
2340	If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.
2340	I get the estimated prices from Jim.
2340	Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?
2340	I need to know by tomorrow morning.
2340	I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.
2340	Thanks
2341	Cash prices have jumped over $.20 since Friday.
2341	I may need to make my prepayment on Wednesday for Reliant and I've bumped up the amout to $42,000 for this week.
2341	I will have a much better idea by 9:00 tomorrow of course.
2342	Hi everybody.
2342	It's Steve Cooper.
2342	It's Friday afternoon, March 1.
2342	I hope everybody has had a great week.
2342	I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.
2342	The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion.
2342	I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues.
2342	Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable.
2342	I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.
2342	In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund.
2342	We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees.
2342	I wanted you to be aware of that.
2342	I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset.
2342	Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program.
2342	As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.
2342	The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee.
2342	We provided to them more data.
2342	Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28.
2342	We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program.
2342	I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority.
2342	It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed.
2342	I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court.
2342	I'll keep you posted on progress.
2342	I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs.
2342	Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.
2342	The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions.
2342	Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week.
2342	Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases.
2342	And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process.
2342	So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.
2342	We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract.
2342	It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate.
2342	I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund.
2342	I'd like your input on that.
2342	I thought it was a great idea and very generous.
2342	We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month.
2342	Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there.
2342	I've tried to get around to say hello here and there.
2342	And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz.
2342	Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries.
2342	Other than that I don't have a lot to report.
2342	We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program.
2342	Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area.
2342	I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.
2342	One other thing...
2342	We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon.
2342	We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here.
2342	We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting.
2342	I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future.
2342	I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.
2342	Anyway, as I was saying...
2342	Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication.
2342	I hope you have a great weekend.
2342	I'll chat with next week.
2343	Steve is working with the admins to see who needs what, CQG, Reuters,.....

2344	In connection with Deloitte & Touche's annual audit of MGAG, Deloitte & Touche is trying to confirm what MGAG has billed ENA for the year ending December 31, 2001.
2344	I would normally send this request directly to settlements.
2344	However, it is my understanding that all request should be coordinated through you due to our circumstance.
2344	If I don't hear from you by 2:30 PM this afternoon, I will send you the 13 page fax I received from Deloitte & Touche and I will give them your name and number as the contact person to comply with their requests.

2345	Her number is 713-721-0709.

2350	Moved the prepay to Wednesday.
2350	The amount is $42,000.00 due to the spike in pirces.
2351	I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the rise in cash prices.
2351	I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab to the worksheet.
2351	That shows when the wires are made and my summary purchases for the month.
2351	One thing I don't have access to is any information that identifies the wire.
2351	Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me to add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.
2351	That's what I plan to do.
2352	Hey, I think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right away.
2353	ok, now i feel like i'm doing somethig worthwhile.
2354	Shawn seems like a nice person.
2354	You should take her out to eat then I'll take you out to eat.
2355	Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.
2355	From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.
2355	That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.
2355	However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.
2355	Questions that need to be answered, ** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
2355	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?
2355	The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.
2355	In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

2356	Kay, who should I work with at Weil?
2356	Jeff, Loretta, are you the right contacts for me at PwC?
2356	Shemin, my first queston for you is will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January)?
2356	Kathryn, what are the imbalances for EES on 11/30/01 I've added Kathryn Bussell to the list.
2356	Kathryn is over the EES Logistics group.
2356	EES has been signing some of the producer letters allowing the producers
2357	Shemin, Kathryn (EES Logistics) is going to send me some information on EES.
2357	I'm going to summarize the date for ENA and EES and resend this email, hopefully within the next hour or so.
2358	I thought of a screwdriver and blue.
2359	Seeing you on Friday was the highlight of my week.
2359	So far its been the highlight of this week as well.

2366	Summary: TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).
2366	TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.
2366	Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.
2366	Kay, Ed, Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.
2366	Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?
2366	Should I contact TDC?
2366	Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day

2369	3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630 Sr. Vice President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time.
2369	TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00.
2369	I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update.
2369	Please let me know what I can tell him.
2369	This was an ENA deal.
2370	call anytime.
2371	Let me know if you see this.

2376	I have not contacted CMS about being added to the list.
2377	Wade, what are the contract numbers that the producer's gas gets allocated too?
2378	Are you getting these?
2379	Steve and I were talking about where to go.
2379	We don't know where yet but I bet we figure it out.
2379	Judy may come with us.
2379	I say goodell coming in this morning and I told him we didn't want him to go.
2379	YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I REALLY LOVE BESIDES MYSELF IS FOOOOOOOOD!!!!!

2381	Shemin and I are going to lunch on Monday.
2381	She might even PAY!!!!!
2381	I told her I was going to bring 12 of my closest friends.
2381	Well, I don't have any friends but I told her that you two might like to go.
2382	I sent you the fax yesterday.
2382	It really looks like all the contracts were terminated effecitve 12/31/2001 to me.
2383	Galveston sounds good to me.
2384	I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not sure if we have sent you anything.
2384	Would you please just send me a GISB agreement out of your shop.
2384	I see you have spoken to EES already.
2384	Thanks Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059
2385	This is my Reliant Energy schedule.
2385	I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week.
2385	I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron.
2385	But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it.
2385	I send them a wire every Thursday, unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday.
2386	I'm your long lost brother BROTHER>
2387	There are 2 Con Eds and I believe this is a contact for the unregulated side.
2387	I don't think Chevron-Texaco has a trading group other than Dynegy.
2388	I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.
2388	He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.
2388	According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).
2388	This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.
2388	Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.
2388	Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.
2389	Let me know if you get this.
2389	Outlook is up but I don't have any email for today which is odd.
2390	I received your fax.
2390	Questions: at the top of the page from Dominion, it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production ... WILL NOT BE CREDITED".
2390	One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE.
2390	What does this effective date stand for.
2390	Also, were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group?
2391	Advice from Judy highlighted in black.
2391	Trogg 522: you need to go to we need advice.
2391	jtownse1965: what is it jtownse1965: ok ....what kind of advice Trogg 522: see if we missed some important items jtownse1965: ok...i'll go check it out jtownse1965: where's baby stroller, car seat, pac-n-play, high chair Trogg 522: I believe laurie has all of those.
2391	but i'll make a not.
2391	jtownse1965: you can get car seat that converts to stroller or vice versa jtownse1965: baby walker jtownse1965: sign up for two car seats...you need one for each car...or sign up for the one that you will need in 6months to a year Trogg 522: I need to keep this email and send it to immer when Outlook comes back up.
2391	Trogg 522: we really didn't have much of a clue when we were going thru the store.
2391	we kept saying, "i dunno" jtownse1965: baby swing....that's a lifesaver jtownse1965: did that help Trogg 522: yes it did.
2391	i gonna cut this email and send it to immer.
2391	she has a list of things that laurie wants to give us.
2391	Trogg 522: you know, these expenses can add up pretty quick.
2391	you should show that to jared and see what he thinks.
2391	Trogg 522: i bet he has a very good idea of what you need for new borns rite now.
2391	jtownse1965: i will...he stepped away....will when he gets back Trogg 522: have you been chatting with dan and scott this morning?
2391	jtownse1965: that's true...yes, chatting with dan ....keeps updating cash prices jtownse1965: it's freezing up here Trogg 522: i can't do any work without outlook jtownse1965: don't know what happened
2392	Boo
2393	I'm stuffed like teddie bear right now.
2394	Ohhh boy.
2394	I just know we are having a big party this week sometime.
2395	U are so mean.
2395	i'm hurting, wait...........my little heart just broke into tiny little pieces.
2396	All my Sonat notes.
2397	Are you going to San Antonio Friday?
2397	Is the little woman going with you - maybe make it a romantic encounter?
2398	Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers for EES.
2398	Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.
2398	We may have to do that anyway.
2398	I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.
2398	I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).
2398	If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.
2398	If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.
2398	Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.
2398	If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.
2398	Thanks
2399	Lee Ann, sounds like Gloria is our key person.
2399	Don't worry about it my request.
2399	thanks
2400	Do you have a phone number for Heidi?
2401	Do you have Heidi or Jim's number.
2401	They left EES.
2402	thanks
2403	I'm going to work out after work today.
2403	Should be home around 6-6:30
2404	Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.
2404	I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.
2404	Let me know what you want to do at this point.
2404	Thanks
2405	Is this a new contract on our side to send to them for review?
2406	Updated schedule through Wednesday 3/13/02.
2407	Yesterday I asked you how to go about paying an invoice from Peoples Energy for $1,380.44.
2407	The charges are for a license fee, a customer service, and an outstanding balance of $983.75.
2407	I found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for Enovate.
2407	Eric Boyt said he thought the Enron people managing the Enovate deal are Beth Jenkins and J.O.
2407	Pagan.
2407	Should I forward this invoice to Beth or J.O.?
2408	These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents.
2408	The attached document is for Enron North America Corp. David is going to see if they can use it.
2408	If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.
2408	Thanks Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059 Address: Attn: Chris Germany ECS 04444 1400 Smith St
2409	Probably spending the night there.
2409	You should go and have a goooood time.
2410	Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.
2410	I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.
2410	Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.
2410	Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.
2410	I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.
2410	This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.
2410	All the activity is for the Enovate deals.
2410	Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.
2410	Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.
2410	Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
2410	Thanks Chris L. Germany Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059

2412	Are you familiar with this item?
2413	At this point, just send everything to me and I'll work with our legal department.
2414	Sempra needs to get a copy of the court order authorizing ENA to enter into GISB's and transactions.
2414	Does such a thing exist that we can send to Sempra?
2414	Thanks
2415	Necessary items for the baby are down below with blue web links.
2416	I don't know if I sent you guys this small humble list of things the baby will need.
2416	Its down below with blue web links.
2417	I'm waiting to hear from Rita.
2417	I'll definitely let you know what happens.
2417	thanks.
2418	Sure.
2418	I'll have Ingy wash and polish it first.
2419	YES.
2419	I think we spent an hour and half at ??babie r us on hwy 59 sunday.
2419	Didn't know if i was going to survive.
2420	Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over.
2420	Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him.
2420	I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below.
2421	Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.
2421	Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.
2421	In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.
2421	We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.
2421	BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies.
2421	Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.
2421	Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?
2421	Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?
2422	Prepay amount for tomorrow is $25,000.00.
2422	Thanks Team.
2423	I hope you are getting somewhere because this is getting annoying.
2423	First he wouldn't send me anything, now they are all over it when he should have just sent me something to begin with.
2424	I need steve's email address.
2424	Do you have it?
2425	I've never talked to Ed about any of this.
2425	I just sent him this email the day you and I spoke.
2425	You might forward this on to him with your comments.
2426	Ask Marvin or whoever looks at Tenn if they are interested in any Iroq / Tenn capacity.
2426	The capacity goes from Tcpl/Iroq - Wadd to Iroq/Tenn - Wright, then from Iroq/Tenn - Wright to Mendon and Boston Gas citygate.
2427	I need to go get a beer with Jim for a little while.

2429	GO BUDDY GO!
2430	Hey team.
2430	ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.
2430	I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.
2430	Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.
2430	If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.
2430	Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.
2430	Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.
2430	Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.
2430	Have a good weekend!
2431	nope
2432	sorry, not till i hear from legal but we probably won't pay the invoice.
2432	as of right now, don't pay the invoice.
2433	9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.
2433	Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.
2433	Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas.
2434	Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.
2434	Here are some items to consider, 2.
2434	Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth 4.
2434	ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.
2434	Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.
2434	We have Dec 2001.
2434	Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?
2434	Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.
2434	Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?
2434	I would be very surprised if they did.
2435	Mark is our "hired" special bankruptcy attorney who works on transportation and storage.
2435	Enron goes to him to get expertise on how to handle the pipeline contracts.
2435	Shemin Proctor is like an Enron staff attorney specializing in transport.
2436	Hey buddy.
2436	I'm going to another meeting.
2436	Don't forget to send me the worksheet.
2436	Thanks
2437	thx buddy
2438	Thanks Max.
2438	Per our discussion today I requested 64,000 dth per day from Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc. I spoke with Carl Haugneland and I faxed him a copy of the attached letter and excel worksheet.
2438	Joe, I am mailing a copy of the letter with attachments to you.
2438	Thanks.
2439	Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2439	2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.
2439	I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.
2439	Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.
2439	When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.
2439	I have not done that.
2439	I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.
2439	Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
2439	1.
2439	Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
2439	2.
2439	ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
2439	3.
2439	The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.
2439	Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.
2439	Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.
2439	I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.
2439	The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.
2439	Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.
2439	Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.
2439	On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.
2439	Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.
2439	I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

2442	I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday.
2442	Cash is up $.20 from Friday.
2442	I may need to make the prepay on Wed again.
2442	I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow.
2443	We are having dinner with Suzanne this Thur if that's ok with you.
2443	I think you and I should register at the hospital tonight or tomorrow night if possible.
2444	ima dominion stud
2445	i guess you don't have msm Messenger do you.
2446	Hey there team.
2446	We are starting to focus on Dominion pipeline and I need your help explaining the process to Shemin.
2446	I would like to set up a meeting with Gloria, Wade, Shemin, Kathryn as soon as possible.
2447	Sounds good.
2447	I believe Alain is out till Thur and I hope we meet before then.
2448	Silly me.
2448	I goofed, I had the wrong beginning balance in my worksheet.
2448	Currently looking at sending out $30,000 on Thursday.
2449	Thanks for the info.
2449	I'm looking for a Dominion/Escript ID and password next please.
2450	Just put the survey on the fax.
2451	I need to get copies of all the invoices for Dominion for ENA, VNG, and EES for Nov-01 through current please.
2451	thanks Fax 713-646
2452	Thanks
2453	Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails.
2453	I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us.
2453	We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available.
2453	I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all.
2454	Where are you located?
2454	I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union.
2455	Max, I forgot all about you needing this.
2455	I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days.
2455	This is what I have done so far.
2456	This has not been a good informative day.
2456	We just need to chat with Dominion to figure out how the contracts work and for me to find out more info the storage contracts.
2457	Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.
2457	Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.
2457	Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.
2457	Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation.
2458	I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account.
2458	I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid.
2458	They said before Dec 2nd.
2458	I told them they should cancel the service.
2458	Don't know if they are going to do that or not.
2458	8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless, this account has been cancelled.
2459	Another interesting item.
2459	Call me when you get a chance.
2460	Prepay amount for tomorrow is $30,000.00.
2460	I gave Doug the hard copy of the wire request.
2460	Thanks team.
2461	I have requested a wire to Reliant for Thursday in the amount of $30,000.00.
2461	Thanks.
2462	My Tenn emails from way back.
2463	I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.
2463	But after that is over, say 1:00 or so, lets get together.
2463	Shemin, you set the time.
2463	Wade, bring some of those letters you are talking about down below.
2463	Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
2463	Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd??
2463	and terminate the pools without Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.
2463	You and Patricia can decide if you want to come.
2463	Thanks
2464	Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.
2464	I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office.
2465	Cool.
2466	actually, could you or Kathryn send Shemin 5 Dominion producer contracts.
2466	Just any 5 will do.
2466	She just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like.
2467	It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd get to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a living.
2467	The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."
2467	The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."
2467	Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men."
2467	The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar He blushed and said, "I'm sorry but my dad is an 1) auditor for Arthur Andersen OR 2) a trader for Enron and I was just too embarrassed to say so."
2468	You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.
2468	Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.
2468	I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.
2468	Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.
2468	Can you help get me access?
2469	I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following; Deal Counterparty Comment 1192958 Sequent Energy Management, LP approved 1198866 Anadarko Energy Services Company approved 1195770 MidAmerican Energy Company approved 1195777 MidAmerican Energy Company Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan.
2469	1195767 MidAmerican Energy Company approved 1192959 City of Tallahassee this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.
2469	I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.
2469	I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either.
2469	GRRRR.
2469	Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.
2469	We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.
2469	Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.
2470	Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.
2470	We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.
2470	I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.
2470	BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.
2471	Sure.
2471	I have one gas purchase that I make right before 9:00 AM every morning but I can be there at 9:05 AM or later.
2472	I have an event that I need to attend tomorrow afternoon so I will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime.
2472	I will send out a plan of action for Trunkline this afternoon.
2472	IF anyone needs me you can page me at 877-498-5497 BUT do not leave a voicemail, I don't know how to retrieve them.
2473	I have confirm letters on my desk.
2473	Should I send those to you?
2474	I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is.
2474	But I do go to this website on the internet to access the Dominion EBB.
2474	Dominion used to be called CNG.
2475	I can't believe it.
2475	I'm having the same trouble again this month.
2475	I use this board about twice a month.
2476	Greg We've chatted before but you may not remember me.
2476	I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.
2476	Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.
2476	I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.
2476	Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas.

2481	Make sure you copy Magaret Dhont and Rita Wynne on this.
2482	The CIA had an opening for an assassin.
2482	After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.
2482	For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.
2482	"We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!"
2482	The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife."
2482	The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."
2482	The second man was given the same instructions.
2482	He took the gun and went into the room.
2482	All was quiet for about 5 minutes.
2482	Then the man came out with tears in his eyes.
2482	"I tried, but I can't kill my wife."
2482	The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."
2482	Finally, it was the woman's turn.
2482	She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband.
2482	She took the gun and went into the room.
2482	Shots were heard, one shot after another.
2482	They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls.
2482	After a few minutes, all was quiet.
2482	The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.
2482	She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."
2482	Moral: Women are evil.
2482	Don't mess with them.
2483	Prepay for Dominion for April 2002 to be made on Friday, March 29th.
2483	I printed out the attached form and gave it to Doug Sewell.
2484	I just deleted something you emailed me on March 20th or 21st.
2484	I think it might have been related to Columbia gas but I'm not sure.
2485	Prepayment and gas flow activity through Monday March 26th.
2485	I have added 2 new members to the team, welcome Melissa and Sheeley.
2485	Feel free to hit Jim Taylor up for a free lunch.
2486	Hey, do you mind if I send her an email with all the stuff attached?
2486	You are my hero.
2487	i took the test and this is what it said.
2487	colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers.
2487	But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged.
2487	Stop trying so hard.
2487	You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'.
2487	In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'.
2487	It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.
2487	Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn.
2487	So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.
2487	You are holding back.
2487	You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all.
2487	The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own.
2487	Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'.
2487	This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome.
2487	You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority.
2487	You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done.
2487	In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.
2487	You need to be respected as an exceptional individual.
2487	This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve.
2487	You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.
2487	Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.
2487	Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.
2488	I mean Susan.
2488	I assume you are talking about Susan Pereira.
2489	FYI, ENA has (or had) about 50,930 of primary receipts at Venice.
2490	I'm not sure.
2490	9:12 AM - I left a message for Brian Lamb at Columbia Gulf.
2491	I will be increasing my prepays to Reliant this week to cover any swing activity on the MCV Trunkline deal.
2491	I have changed the "est cash flow" tab in the Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow file.
2492	I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).
2492	I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.
2492	When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?
2492	We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.
2492	I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that.
2493	Barbara was going to tell you that I called.
2493	I'm going to get my morning diet coke and I would like to see the name that lady gave us last night that might have some daycare info.
2493	later gator
2494	Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.
2494	This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.
2494	I believe both deals go through March 2013.
2494	I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.
2494	This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).
2494	His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.
2494	Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.
2494	Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy??
2494	in the past.
2494	He will fax a letter to me.
2494	Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.
2495	I posted the April TW capacity.
2495	11:50 AM left a voicemail for Russell Williamson at BP Amoco 11:52 AM left a voicemail for Robert Eason at Burlington Julie Reames is on maternity leave for 12 weeks .
2496	3:30 at Ed's desk if fine.
2496	thanks
2497	Conference room ECS04105 at 3:30 PM
2498	Louis Dicarlo said you should chat with Sara Shackleton about the Dominion ISDA agreement.
2498	BUT you may already be doing that.
2499	Done with these.
2499	Is there another list?
2499	I can't remember.
2500	You are my hero.
2500	I am going to have a 2 day backup plan just in case Dominion doesn't deliver any gas.
2501	Will do.
2501	Thanks for the info.
2502	Looks good to me.
2502	First word of second para - Ever or Even?
2503	I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.
2503	She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.
2503	Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.
2503	This was just in case you had the same question.
2504	I wonder if HR changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months?
2504	Let's ask Kathy, she will know.
2505	Should I cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today?
2505	It might be too late but I can check.
2506	I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.
2506	The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.
2506	I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
2506	This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).
2507	These are all the people I have been working with lately.
2508	Thanks.
2508	You too!!
2509	FYI
2510	I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.
2510	Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?
2510	Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash?
2510	maybe and trying to correct a few things.
2510	I'm not sure what the process is now.
2510	Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?
2510	By the way team, Scott is out till next week.
2511	What is our Dominion status?
2512	You are a stud
2513	I'm LOOOOOKING!!!!
2514	I'm just glad you are working today.
2514	Makes me feel good.
2515	Hey woman!!
2515	How are things going?
2515	Happy with the job?
2515	Happy with the man?
2515	Be carefull, something happened to my woman and she has a really big stomach.
2516	Would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at Enron requested that no invoices be sent out.
2516	Thanks
2517	It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.
2517	Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of?
2518	ENA has an approximate cash balance of $58,000 with Reliant after purchasing the 2,000 dth for tomorrow.
2518	Melissa verifed receipt of the $1.7 million wire made last Thursday.
2518	THANKS MELISSA!!
2518	Let me know if anyone has questions.
2519	I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year.
2519	But, I still need a backup for the gas activity.
2519	Unless you tell me to do something different, I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up.
2520	I sold 3,253 dth per day of Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.
2520	I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.
2520	Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.
2520	Would you work on that?
2520	Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.
2520	You and I can chat about that later.
2520	I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.
2520	Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.
2521	I'll check on it.
2522	No buddy.
2522	Thank you.
2522	And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too.
2522	My treat.
2522	Maybe I'll invite my work wife, Judith.
2522	I'm thinking about Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.
2522	I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.
2522	Of course you have a say, a small one anyway.
2523	They are starting on the 4th.
2523	I thought I told him the 3rd but I may have made a mistake.
2523	My fault.
2523	Thanks
2524	Probably not.
2524	I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week.
2525	Let me know if you get this.
2525	thanks

2527	Got it.
2527	Thanks
2528	Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.
2528	The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.
2528	Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.
2528	What do you think?
2528	?
2528	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
2528	?
2528	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.
2528	Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.
2528	Thanks
2529	I walked to the park yesterday and didn't see you.
2529	It was such a bummer.
2529	Today is Eirc's last day, sniff sniff.
2529	It was good seeing you.
2529	Take care.
2530	Hey buddy, please include Kathy on you distribution in the future.
2530	thanks
2531	I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.
2531	Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.
2531	Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.
2531	I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.
2531	I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.
2531	Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.
2531	I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.
2531	But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.
2531	I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.
2531	I'm going to try and meet her today.
2531	Sabra, are you handling this?
2531	Let me know.
2531	If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?
2531	I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.
2531	Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.
2531	Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.
2532	Joe went to work for Bridgeline yesterday.
2533	When she refinances, will your name be taken off the loan on the house?
2534	Our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 4th is $43,350.
2534	I've requested a prepayment of $37,000 to be wired tomorrow afternoon.
2534	Have a good day!
2535	The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 4th is $37,000.
2535	I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk.
2536	You are my hero buddy.
2536	And you think I should get married?
2536	FYI while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.
2536	Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.
2536	Take care and best of luck to you and the family.
2537	FYI, MCV swing activity on Trunkline, not ANR.
2537	Monday, March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas.
2538	I just spoke with Theresa Vos.
2538	She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.
2538	Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.
2538	There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.
2538	It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.
2538	We can chat about that next week.
2538	Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?
2538	I'd like to see that if possible.
2538	Thanks I'm taking off Friday.

2581	Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.
2581	We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.
2581	I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.
2581	Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.
2581	Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.
2581	My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.
2581	I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file.
2582	When you get the price for the 10,000 dth we are selling you for Friday, would you send it via email.
2582	I forward that info to 3 different people.
2582	Thanks
2583	Suzanne, give them Priscilla's number or my number.
2583	Priscilla is at 713-345-3736 and my number is 713-853-4743.
2583	thanks

2584	whatever that means
2585	I'll be taking off the 1/2 day next Tuesday April 16th and all day next Friday April 19th unless someone has pressing needs.
2585	Kathy Kelly will be backing me up on all gas activity next Friday.
2586	Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.
2586	Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?
2586	The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.
2586	This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.
2586	There are more notes at the bottom of this email.
2587	You better believe it.
2587	I'll bring my photos for the "magazine" shoot.
2588	Would you see if we sent out an invoice for deal 384258 to Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. for December 2001 and January 2002?
2588	And if we did, did they pay it?
2588	Thanks
2589	Oh yeah, I'm looking good now.
2589	I found some 5 year old "Tan in a Can" and spread it all over.
2589	It caused a small rash in a couple of spots but I brushed those up in the photo.
2590	How much should we sell for Sat - Mon?
2591	Thanks
2592	Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system.
2592	I've requested access to change the tickets.
2592	I'll send a new email once I enter the deal.
2592	Thanks Let me know if you see any other missing items too.
2593	Judy is going to send you an email.
2593	I don't know what they changed to.
2594	Who and where are they located?
2595	I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.
2595	Here's the problem.
2595	I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.
2595	I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.
2595	They probably were not consistent any.
2595	Would you path this?
2595	Just take you best shot on how to do it.
2595	I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.
2595	I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.
2596	I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details; Price: $2.25 Volume: 1,121,702 Location: MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1 Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.
2596	I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.
2596	Do you get any statements from MPC?
2597	I'll copy you, but it is Ponderosa sending out the bills correct?
2598	This is my morning chat with Lynn at TXU, what Enron people went to TXu and what the heck are they doing?
2598	lynn8464 (7:55:33 AM): hi lynn8464 (7:55:39 AM): what kind of volume lynn8464 (7:55:50 AM): for the wkend lynn8464 (7:55:54 AM): gotcha Trogg 522 (11:03:29 AM): do you have a price for me yet?

2598	Watch him, he's sneaky.
2598	Just look at those beady eye's - just like an originator/car salesman.
2598	And you can tell him I said so.
2598	lynn8464 (11:10:17 AM): where does he work here?
2598	Trogg 522 (11:10:41 AM): don't know actully, i'll try to find out.

2600	I wanna do lunch with you.
2600	When can you pencil me in?
2600	I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday.

2603	Next Wed it is.
2604	Good morning!
2604	Would you let me know if you received a wire from Enron on Friday april 12th please?
2604	The amount was $22,000.00.
2604	Thanks
2605	Looks like a pain in the ass girl.
2605	Let's see, that would make 2 in my household.
2606	Hi Jon.
2606	We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team.
2606	I'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release Offer #20275 Released to Enserco Term 4/8/02 to 4/30/02 demand rate $1.30 Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743.
2607	Priscilla said Mid American just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice.
2607	Have you pathed this yet?
2607	Let me know.
2608	Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.
2608	That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.
2608	They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.
2608	Don't know if that's it or not.
2608	The lease at the tower is up ?next year?
2608	I think.
2608	The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.
2608	If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere.
2609	FYI
2610	Melissa verified our payment on Friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $61,790.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow.
2611	Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.
2611	At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.
2611	Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.
2611	I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.
2612	2002 Vacation Rollover from 2001 40 hours 2002 credit 160 hours Disc Holiday 8 hours Total 208 hours = 26 days Vacation Days 208 Beginning Balance 8 hours Disc Holiday Mon 2/11/02 8 hours Fri 3/15/02 4 hours Fri 3/22/02 8 hours Fri 3/29/02 4 hours Tue 4/16/02 8 hours Fri 4/19/02 40 hours total 168 hours remaining = 21.0 day
2613	Don't lie to me.
2613	I know you didn't read the "fine print" where you are taking everyone in your shop out for a free lunch.
2614	does that mean we don't have to count half day tomorrow or all day Friday then I'm even?
2615	ok, left my palm at home, i'm about to go into a meeting that may last a long time.
2615	i'm going to get my hair cut after work then I'm coming home.
2615	should be there before 7 depending on when i get out of my meeting.
2615	Hope you are feeling ok.
2615	i need a nap.

2631	Our current cash balance is $54,820.00 AND we are moving back to the old building today so I've decided to wait until Friday to send a wire.
2631	Thanks
2632	No wire for tomorrow since we are moving.
2632	We will do a cash request tomorrow and send out a wire on Friday.
2633	We are still meeting for beverages this evening around 6ish, correct?
2634	I didn't call to check on this but I've never seen an email like this from CGAS.
2634	I just thought it was interesting.
2635	we knew we were moving yesterday but we though we would have our systems availabe till after lunch.
2635	I was wrong.
2635	We were working at 9:45, I stood up for something and the movers took my chair.

2636	hey what does xoxo mean?
2637	I am requesting a prepayment of $17,000 to be paid to Reliant for Friday April 18th.
2637	Priscilla, let me know when you have the wire ready and I'll come get it OR you can leave it on my desk at ECN0604c.
2637	Doug, are you still on 4 in the new building?:
2638	not unless EES had some TCO storage we were not aware of.
2638	They would be doing something with 620,000 if they were fooling with our stuff.
2639	yes i did.
2639	Friday April 19th.
2639	Well their we go, I've made my 1(00,000) mistake for the year and I'm all out.
2639	Nothin' but perfection from now on.
2640	I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.
2640	He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.
2640	I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.
2640	1) This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.
2640	He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.
2640	2) Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.
2640	I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.
2640	Just a thought.
2641	I think I have access to everything now.
2641	thanks
2642	My bunkmate, Troy, would like to speak to your cleaing person.
2642	He's thinking about hiring someone to clean his apartment.

2643	Where are you?
2644	Ed was questioning the value of the Tallahasse deal due to the higher prices.
2644	He said we should check into it.

2645	Sell gas to TXU Energy.
2645	Either Lynn Handlin at 214-875-9789 or Fran Russell at 214-875-9793.
2645	I believe Fran will be handling the TXU activity tomorrow.
2645	I let TXU pick the points they want the gas.
2645	Thx, call me on my cell if you have questions.
2646	Deal 1035543, a sale to Giant Refining Company, was terminated effective 12/1/01.
2646	It looks like the Trk Nom and Schd volumes should be taken out.
2647	PNM Gas Services was terminated on 12/7/01.
2647	Same as the previous email where there are Trk Nom and Schd volumes in Unify but nothing in Sitara.
2648	I've requested a $17,000.00 wire to be made tomorrow and we still have a cash balance of $54,820.00.
2648	I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity.
2648	Her number is 713-853-5858.
2648	Thanks and have a good weekend.
2649	Kathy, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.
2649	Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.
2649	We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.
2649	If it ever happens on the weekend, Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.
2649	Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.
2649	If I remember correctly, Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant.
2649	Are we sill set up that way?
2650	These are funny.
2650	I thought it might be enron photos at first.
2651	Good Morning!
2651	I love taking Fridays off.
2651	I see Kathy sold 10,000 dth for the weekend.
2651	Let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow.
2651	If I don't hear from you by 8:00 AM C.T.
2651	I'll just sell 10,000 dth.
2651	thanks
2652	Thanks for the info.
2652	I voted to get that sucker lowered to 45 and 10,000 of my closest friends are doing the same thing.
2653	Kathy said some Mobil traders created National Energy And Trade after Mobil let go of a bunch of people.
2653	I guess you know that both Molly and Chris worked for Mobil.
2653	By the way I did the math on Sabra.
2654	Rita, I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December.
2654	I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas.
2654	I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future.
2654	I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you.
2654	Thanks
2655	sounds good to me
2656	Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU for 4/23 at $3.37 Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.
2656	I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.
2656	Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.
2657	I had the time of my life.
2657	My only regret was not being able to spend more time with you.
2657	thx for the invite.
2657	i think my happy hour days are almost over.
2658	did you count the half day on 4/16 or all day on 4/19 or should we leave these as unofficial time?
2659	Melissa Garner verified receipt of the $17,000.00 wire last Friday.
2659	Thanks Melissa.
2659	Our current cash balance with Reliant is $57,180.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow.
2659	Thanks.
2660	yeah i know.
2660	i'm looking at that now.
2661	I'm moving my cash payment to Reliant to Friday.
2661	Phil is going to give me new market values for Tallahassee and Midland tomorrow morning.
2662	MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.
2662	MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).
2662	I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.
2662	Please let me know.
2662	Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?
2662	I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here.
2663	you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on.
2663	it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it.
2663	i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building.
2663	oh well, YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2664	What is the status of the Dominion issue?
2664	Thanks
2665	I am doing the noms on this one.
2666	Just faxed them.
2667	our distinct personality, The White Knight, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time.
2667	Don Quixote was a White Knight as was Joan of Arc, the Lone Ranger and Crusader Rabbit.
2667	As a White Knight you expect nothing in return for your good deeds.
2667	You are one of the true "Givers" of the world.
2667	You are the anonymous philanthropist who shares your wealth, your time and your life with others.
2667	To give, is its own reward and as a White Knight you seek no other.
2667	On the positive side you are merciful, sympathetic, helpful, giving and heroic.
2667	On the negative side you may be impulsively decisive, sentimental and misdirected.
2667	Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.
2668	I would like for you to take this test and see what type of medieval character you are.
2668	Once you see what type of character you are - email me a copy of the description.
2668	I am a White Knight.
2668	I bet you are a Benevolent Ruler.
2669	Tenn Net 284 Contract Commodity $.0000 Total $.0087 Fuel 1.31% GRI $.0000 Note: GRI does not apply on this path because Iroq delivers gas to Tenn at wright (non GRI point) Total $.0057 Fuel .5% Note: The Iroq Tariff allows them to charge up to 1% fuel, but I believe the max is 1% for Zone 1 to Zone 2 and .5% for Zone 1 to Zone 1 but I didn't read that in the tariff.
2669	I think Iroq might have told me that back in normal times.
2670	our distinct personality, The Shepherd is to tend to your human flock.
2670	You understand the needs of those for whom you are responsible.
2670	Shepherds are vigilant and reliable.
2670	You realize your obligation and commitment to the well being of those entrusted to your care.
2670	Shepherds are very dependable.
2670	You engender a feeling of comfort and stability to those within your charge.
2670	On the positive side, Shepherds can be empathic, caring, understanding, practical and realistic.
2670	On the negative side, you may be manipulative, close-minded and sentimentally rigid.
2670	Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.
2671	Hey Jeff, when are noms for the 1st due?
2671	Thanks
2672	My cell phone is charging in the car but I will have my pager on if you need me.
2672	My pager number is 877-498-5497.
2672	Remember, I can only see numeric messages.
2672	Have a nice day.
2673	This is only a test Who is the most beautiful person you know working at Enron today?
2673	What kind of new car should I buy?
2673	How many mispelled words are in dis email?
2673	Now then take this little character test and email me your character descreption at the botton of the page (you will know when you see it).
2674	Let Kevin know about any suspected unpathed deals and he will get all over it.
2674	This guy is going to be my boss someday.
2675	Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 1.
2675	it is more conservative 2.
2675	the difference is small 3.
2675	that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.
2675	If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.
2675	Thanks
2676	this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.
2676	I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit.
2677	I wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing?
2678	take me with you where ever you go.
2678	You de MAN
2679	do you have sabra's cell number?
2680	filled internally with some guy whose name i can't remember, it was a southeast orig spot.
2680	i went to lunch with jim taylor and malory ????, she knows you.
2680	she is from coastal
2681	Please read the note below from Jeff at Lone Star, it looks like we may need to be particular for May.
2681	Of cause that would involve me knowing a little more about the pipeline.
2682	Kevin is my hero.
2683	Sold 10,.000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/25 at $3.29
2684	I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.
2684	Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.
2684	Why wouldn't that be you instead?
2684	[Germany, Chris]
2685	Susan just called me and said she is the CAO for ENA and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests.
2685	I didn't know.
2686	Yesterday David Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.
2686	I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.
2686	He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".
2686	I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing.
2686	Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".
2686	Just like the old days.
2687	Thanks
2688	Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?
2688	I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice.
2688	I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.
2688	Let me know what your preference is.
2688	I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).
2688	I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.
2688	I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.
2689	I am requesting a prepayment of $45,000 to be paid to Reliant for Monday April 29th.
2689	Priscilla, please bring me the wire request and I will get Ed and Susan to sign off on it.
2689	Stephen, Drew, who should I give the wire too and where are you located?
2689	Thanks
2690	Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/26//02 at $3.24 Also received a call from Jeff at Lone Star telling us to work a little harder at working off the imbalance.
2691	nope, i think it looks real good with burns like that.
2691	but when you see a low day come in we should probably sell a littel more for the next day.
2692	Insurance Trina need to contact them within 45 days of birth, qualifies as a life event and its effective the date of birth my flex dollars received will increase from $164.29 to $182.67 My current flex dollar expense will go from $103.62 to $165.22 with Immer's kid.

2693	29 min.
2694	Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?
2695	Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.
2695	On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.
2695	Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.
2695	Thanks
2696	You bet.
2697	NOW THAT's WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR!!!!
2697	Thanks Drew.
2697	Ok, no more bad talk about Drew for the rest of the week.
2697	Is today Friday?
2697	just kidding
2698	yes maam.
2698	GOOD LUCK!!
2699	Jackie, just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May.
2699	I'm not sure of the impact just yet but either I or Kathy Kelly will keep you posted.
2699	Thanks.
2700	U are here!!!!
2700	LUcky me.
2701	Cute little bugger.
2701	Scott Goodell said forget the Salt Lake City thing.
2701	He said Suzanne is paving the way for him with Michael Cathey.
2701	I don't know him.
2702	OK, that's it.
2702	NO VACATION FOR YOU!
2703	FYI I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone.
2703	I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois, she is the capacity release lady.
2703	She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all.
2704	I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.
2704	The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.
2704	The total amount is $3,695,975.00.
2704	According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.
2704	She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.
2704	1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.
2705	I don't know if you guys can pull up my file from the previous email.
2705	Here it is again just in case.

2708	Looks like I'll be here for at least a year but you never know.
2708	I bet you guys miss me too, calling up, asking dumb questions, falling off horses at the shipper meeting.
2708	How's life for you?
2709	Lets see if this works.
2709	My response is down below in blue.
2710	Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet.
2710	Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday.
2710	Is this something that we should continue to get?
2711	that sounds good to me, unless i hear from you in 30 min or so i'll toss what we have from them.
2712	consider it tossed
2713	I don't see you on MSN.
2713	My time free's up after 9:00 in the morning.
2713	Tallahassee has to call on the swing gas by then.
2714	4/30/02 8:25 AM - Janelle said they would send the money today.
2715	Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.
2715	Thanks Melissa.
2715	You should receive the following wires today.
2715	Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.
2715	Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.
2715	Her number is 713-853-7177.
2715	Thanks
2716	Scroll down and look at the list of names.
2717	Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.
2717	I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers - asking for Roger's phone number and title.
2718	Harry, I think we finally have everything done on our side.
2718	Would you give me your phone number and address and we will mail you the GISB.
2718	Thanks
2719	Contact info at El Paso
2720	I just briefly told Ed what you and I discussed.
2720	He doesn't seem to want any additional info.
2720	I'll keep my notes of our conversation anyway.
2720	thanks
2721	Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.
2721	I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.

2721	Thanks
2722	Would you let Phil and I know when you hear abuot CMS's payment please?

2723	I've adjusted out weekly prepay to reliant down to $10,000.00 to go out on Friday.
2723	I want Robin to go through the wire process once just in case I'm not here next week.
2724	FYI, just verified with Melissa that Reliant received $2,049,602.20 for the items listed below.
2724	Thanks Melissa.
2725	Thanks
2726	Robin confirmed that we did receive the payment from CMS.
2726	This is the amount we invoiced CMS or the Michcon storage gas.
2726	Thanks Robin!
2727	To my knowledge that capacity is still valid.
2727	It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth.
2727	Ruth, I had asked George Linder?
2727	at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times.
2727	He never did anything with it.
2728	I am requesting a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be paid to Reliant for Friday May 3rd.
2729	April prices Inside Ferc Per Midland ANR LA 3.31 3.3125 Looks good Pepl 3.29 3.3345 appears high by about $.0245 but not way off.
2729	Trk Tx 3.28 3.28 Trunkline should be an average but this is great, our price would have been $3.305
2730	Please add Robin Barbe to your distribution.
2730	Robin, I glance at Phil's worksheet everyday since I generate most of the cash payments in our group.
2731	You should have the email below in your inbox talking about the producers on CGAS.
2731	Reply to the email below once you find out if you are able to use the producer's gas without maintaining a balance.

2732	Germany, Chris says: hey, maybe you could go to FPL in florida?

2735	Hey, I normally talk bad about you but lately I've been bragging because of your good notes on Ponderosa Pines.
2736	But I'm going to try and keep it down to minimum.
2737	One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well.
2737	The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do.
2737	Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway.
2737	It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.
2737	He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him.
2737	They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.
2737	At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly.
2737	Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down.
2737	A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.
2737	With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing.
2737	He would shake it off and take a step up.
2737	As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up.
2737	Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!
2737	Now, the Moral of the Story: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt.
2737	The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.
2737	Each of our troubles is a stepping stone.
2737	We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up!
2737	Shake it off and take a step up!
2737	Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1.
2737	Free your heart from hatred.
2737	2.
2737	Free your mind from worries.
2737	3.
2737	Live simply.
2737	4.
2737	Give more.
2737	5.
2737	Expect less.
2737	P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.
2737	Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.
2738	I also have imbalance statements that I have received in the mail that I will be sending to Theresa.
2739	I would bump up the cash payment to Reliant for next week.
2739	I'm estimating $56,000.00.
2739	I do expect it to come down some.
2740	Reliant should receive a payment of $10,000.00 today which will give us a cash balance of $60,820.00.
2740	Have a good weekend.
2741	Nosir.
2741	You are the man working on this FREAKY pipe.
2742	I'm good for $3
2743	The name sounds familiar but I don't know this guy.
2743	He's over scheduling at El Paso.
2743	Greg Stickline 713-420-6463.
2743	Good luck and let me know how it turns out.
2744	Shelley verified receipt of our $10,000.00 payment o Reliant last Friday.
2744	Thanks Shelley.
2744	Our current cash balance with Reliant is $60,880.00.
2745	I was just looking at the confirm for April and I believe the pricing doesn't match up.
2745	Let me know if you have any questions.
2745	Thanks.
2746	I'm forcasting $30,000.00 to be paid to Reliant this Friday for the Tallahassee deal.
2747	For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.
2747	Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.
2747	No sales were made for 5/8/02.
2748	thanks
2749	Mike, I'm faxing you official statements from the pipeline and I'm going to mail them to Theresa Vos.
2750	Let's see if this works.
2751	Let's try again.
2752	I have a problem keeping my cell phone battery charged up.
2752	But, my pager still works so I'm wearing it if you guys need me.
2752	My pager number is 877-498-5497.
2752	Do not leave a voice message on it because I can't retrieve those.
2752	Thanks
2753	I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil, I think.
2753	Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers, or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers?
2753	Thanks
2754	Actually, I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for.
2754	I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk, can't be that many of them.
2754	But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for.
2755	When: Thursday, May 09, 2002 11:00 AM-12:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
2756	this is looking good.
2757	Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday, the 10th.
2757	I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if possible.
2757	Thanks.
2758	i don't have it.
2758	I think Max Doner gets a copy from someone but I'm not sure who.
2759	2701 Revere St. #221 Phone 713-527-0534
2760	I didn't send this yet and I have not spoken with Cinergy either.
2760	Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please.
2760	Also, the scheduling contact at TXU is David Avila, his number is 214-875-9792, his aol id is avila4404.
2760	I gave David the upstream information.
2760	He said that for the weekend the downstream k# is 1901.
2761	Just all outstanding unpaid amounts.
2761	it mite be easier for me to just go through the file and not worry about the copies since we are on the same floor.
2761	I just need you to tell me what is outstandind and what isn't.
2762	does this mean the system was keeping track of my unofficial vacation?

2783	Hey team!!
2783	I'm back.
2783	And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05, which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th.
2783	Jim, I've updated my schedule for the gas flows on Florida.
2783	Tallahassee sent me a schedule of what they show.
2783	I'l like to compare that to what you have.
2784	very good and tastefull
2785	Hey, I live like that.
2786	I have some really bad news.
2786	My little girl, when she makes a frown face, she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.
2786	I think that's a very bad sign.
2786	She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.
2787	I see that Shemin is out until next week.
2787	Since you are becoming a law guru you might know the answer to this question.
2787	The following document is an order from the court.
2787	Does that mean it has been filed and is in effect now?
2788	Due to credit concerns, Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with.
2788	Ex: I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.
2788	According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.

2794	Deal Deal Date
2795	A.K.

2795	I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.
2795	A.K.
2795	I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.
2795	As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well.
2796	Done.
2797	Thanks!!

2805	Do these counterparties look familiar?
2805	Call me when you get this please?
2805	Thanks.
2806	El Paso and Reliant don't have time to talk about right now but I'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns.
2806	It's not the same as selling parked gas on Sonat.
2806	Still working it though.
2807	Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?
2807	If so give him a big kiss and a hug from me.
2808	I don't think the triggers are correct.
2808	Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed.
2808	Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.
2808	Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?
2808	One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.
2808	We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.
2808	These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.
2809	BETH!!!
2809	Donna!!!
2809	Welcome to the party!
2809	Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.
2809	1.
2809	Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?
2809	2.
2809	There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.
2809	Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?
2809	Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.

2836	This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.

2836	Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.
2836	I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.

2843	If she's no longer there then call Andy Armstrong in the bid room and he will find out who our rep is.
2843	His number is 832-676-5120.
2843	Anyone that answers the phone in the bid room should be able to tell us how our rep is.
2843	Our rep at Iroquois is Robin Zaleski at 203-925-7274.
2844	I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas.
2844	He will do a conference call with us tomorrow.
2844	I told him it would probably be around our lunch time.
2844	He said that is fine.
2844	I can set up a time tomorrow.
2844	His boss, Jeanne Adkins, told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows.
2845	howdy
2846	Chris Lee Germany Phone 713-853-4743
2847	The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.
2847	This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.
2847	The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.
2847	The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.
2847	The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.
2847	The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.
2847	ENA is agent for both of these companies.
2848	Jeanne Adkins 304-357-2865 Jeanne's title is Manger and Steve's title is Lead Facilitator.
2849	I would be a likely candidate.
2849	I checked my desk and I don't have it.
2850	Ruth, I SEE YOU ON THE PHONE OVER THERE.
2850	Probably with Shemin too!
2850	Shemin, I'm sending this to you company email and your Enron email.
2850	Do you use the Enron email system?
2850	Wade said he just received a call from Gary Novenski?
2850	at DRI.

2850	I'm waiting for Steve Stonestreet to call me back so I can learn how to run all of these reports.
2850	Wade is making copies of the reports he has to give to Ruth.
2851	Could you get me the Inside Ferc file for June 2002 please?
2851	Thanks

2853	look here billy bob, i send it to you just so's you can see who else i send it to.
2853	i think i'll keep sending it to you and i think you will like it!!
2853	now go fetch me a diet coke and make sure you clean the top of the can too!
2854	Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.
2854	Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.
2854	Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?
2854	Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?
2855	WOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, Daddy's getting a new Blue Wave Bay boat!!!!
2855	WOOOHOOOO
2856	ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.
2856	In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).
2856	Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.
2856	Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.
2856	Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.
2856	This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.
2856	The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.
2856	Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.
2856	Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?
2856	According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.
2857	With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.
2857	As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.
2857	Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.
2857	Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.
2857	For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.
2857	For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.
2857	At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go.
2857	No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.
2857	Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.
2857	Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

2858	In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.
2858	Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.
2858	Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.
2858	I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.
2858	I'll see what I can do.

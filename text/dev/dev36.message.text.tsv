2	The view is that the CapEx hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.
2	Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real.
3	I thought any 'Contractors' had a zero limit which must be the case.
3	We have Kathy Abshire buying things and she is a contractor.
3	Please could you check that contractors and temps have a zero limit.
4	Aha, could you provide a column including the approver.
4	Thanks Louise
5	Ok - this isn't dying.
5	I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.
5	West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.
5	Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?
5	Can we help?
5	Louise
6	As I never approved this, I just wondered if the rumours were true that we did spend money on this trip.
6	Let me know Thanks Louise
7	Who is Bruce Golden?
8	Hughes Fallon Kitchen Delainey Dietrich McMahon Bowen McConnell Brown Piper Garland

12	Did you give John a copy?
12	Where are Technical Services?

13	A. EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.
13	As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.
13	Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.
13	Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.
13	We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.
13	Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to: 1) Access new markets and customers In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.
13	The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.
13	2) Manage high volume of products and transactions Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.
13	Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.
13	The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.
13	More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.
13	To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].
13	Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.
13	3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.
13	The results have been widely reported in the media.
13	Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business. Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005. Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

22	terminated as long as we can ie there has been a PIP in place etc but as usual things are slow.
22	She refuses to take a director position - if you ask me she is posturing and will resign for another job shortly - I think she is looking for a payoff.
23	on fuel cells - please set it up and ask Duran Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
24	I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.
24	I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.
24	Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?
24	If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.
24	Thanks Louise
25	Good job.
25	I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much.
26	I was sort of assuming Sally would bring this with her to the meeting.
26	Am I wrong?
27	Apologies Abigail - sent to you by mistake
28	Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.
28	You should also have had a voicemail from John.
28	See you when you get back.
28	Let's also talk about your contract when you're back.
29	I will - thanks

41	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

44	Could you fill in all the other assets Thanks
45	You won - it was a convincing argument
46	Thanks very much.
46	Louise
47	Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.
47	Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
47	John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward.
48	It worked
49	Ted, The people included in the cc: are those people we nominate to interview on the below mentioned days.

56	Great news - it'll be great for you

57	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

60	diary
61	That's ok, it was nice to see/meet Emma too
62	I want to talk to him - but see if he gets past you guys first Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

63	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
64	Look at the length of this meeting

66	Please confirm there is nothing else like a restaurant reservatio or something?
67	Hello again There is a gentleman here at work looking for a place for 10 in Beaver Creek.
67	The website (Sales) has disappeared , so I can't show him the pictures - do you have another set of the pictures you could email me as I might have another customer for you.
67	Thanks Louise
68	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

76	Why is the CA dated August 6th - have we been sitting on it since then?
77	Let's just hope no-one notices.
78	Obviously it is not what we want - we are assuming Anthony has power Beth has gas.
79	Let's hope no-one else notices.
79	Let's make sure no-one does anything internally so people notice it.
79	Thanks
80	Hideous photo - couldn't we have given them a better one!
81	Haha - definitely not!
82	thanks - I await the next update
83	Need to include Saguoro
84	I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.
84	Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.
84	Issues: Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is issuing 3 times in some cases.
84	Will this mean we order three by accident?
84	I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.
84	Please resend with descriptors.
84	Thanks Louise
85	Funny.
86	Thanks very much - perfect.
87	Don't worry orig is what I wanted
88	Just to check have you ever done anything other than gas and zinc.
88	If so, when and how much?
89	We passed each other .
89	This answers all my questions Thanks
90	Let's try and keep this quiet.
91	nearly time to go
92	Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?
92	It'll happen
93	I concur with your view .
93	No to all of them Louise
94	Just a quick question - 23 years for PGT?
95	Great thanks

102	I'm ok
103	Give her 13
104	I can't tomorrow - how about next time she is in town.

105	Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.
105	But definitely put a list together.
105	Thanks
106	Trying to keep it quiet too - sems to be working - Lavo didn't even see it
107	I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.
107	(IT budget for this year is $735mm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I'm still working on this one obviously)
108	Hideous isn't it - I'm 9 months pregnant in it.
109	Can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately (at their cost as it is late) whatever they can of the order.
110	Ha bloody ha
111	Funny though isn't it!
112	I rang Jeff - he's out
113	Surreal experience really.
113	I was hoping no-one noticed.
113	PR did it and as you can imagine - without asking.
114	Cheers Big Ears
115	Broadcast voicemail - sounded good!
116	Yes and Yes
117	I really want it in Q4 - not Q3
118	No fine thanks
119	is speaking to Mike McConnell today
120	Thanks
121	"What happened to this guy?
122	Itss crap - almost all of our own websites.
122	I've read it - probably have a copy somewhere if you want it.
123	We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp. Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).
123	We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.
123	As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).
123	We are all over this one but progress is slow.
123	If you want more details - let us know.
124	See photo
125	We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.
125	We will not agree to an allocation though.
125	Thanks Louise
126	Thanks - appreciated
127	Yes
128	Hope you saw the funny side and it cheered you up!
129	Was down $10mm in Q3 - did you know?
130	I think I have your replacement for Savita.
131	Amita is now free
132	At least she will not keep quiet.
133	Duran has to okay it
134	Like to me with you today.
135	OK
136	I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way.
136	I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise.
137	Did we take the money against this from the nymex swap?
138	Did you get this?
139	On my way down.
139	Where do I go for lunch?
140	and the current slides you have on display I'll then do the updates to our slides and correct the errors.
140	Thanks
141	You have two problems (i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm) (ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap.
141	(approximately ($9mm) is not offset) Louise
142	Could you put together a list of all the Enron Corp employees who have Enron (non-Dell) equipment at home.
143	When is it as Marcus is away on Thursday - I presume Chicago is Wed and obviously I can't do Philadephia as Marcus is away.
143	I presume you know all this - am I looking at the wrong week - is Chicago next week?
144	When is it - I can't miss that if its the budget meeting?
144	It appears to be every day.
144	I am a bit worried now about next week - I appear to have some real scheduling difficulties.
145	Not entirely sure - John requested this on Friday I 'll check
146	I can't do these dates.
146	I will be on my way back from Chicago (Peoples meeting).
146	Sorry Louise
147	I am hope I haven't just refused this for no reason but if my diary is right - Marcus is away.
148	When is that lunch with the Board we got invited to?
148	What time are John & I presenting at the Board?
148	Why do I have meetings on Wed - I thought Chicago was Wednesday?
149	Hello Pat, We would like you to price: Chairs (2) The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.
149	SOFA The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).
149	PILLOWS 3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).
149	Would the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?
149	Please could you let me know the prices.
149	Thanks Louise Nettelton
150	Hello - hope you had a good week-end.
150	Two things - PIPs are still not done and I still have never had my pay reconciled.
150	Thanks Louise
151	If you pursue the overtime issue, coul dyou please let me know.
151	Thanks Hope you had a good wek-end.
152	I do need to alter one slide and also I am keen to see the financial slide whenever it is done.
152	Hope you had a good week-end.
153	Been there, done that.
153	This doesn't allow us to you have to be based in London!!!
154	George, We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place - we are way below others for costs.
154	Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?
154	Louise
155	Not prizes for that title.
156	Duran to run it
157	Seems we missed a circulation - this wasn't the last one circulated on Friday.
157	I will send you the final one at 12.
158	diary
159	Thanks
160	Woops Another coming in 5 minutes.
161	We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.
161	I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up.
161	Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.
161	They are: Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
161	Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.
161	Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.
161	Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.
161	I am assuming its zero at the moment.
161	Thanks Louise
162	Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.
162	In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.
162	I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way.
163	ATS is not new origination and shows through the MPR.
163	All the rest were too small.
163	Louise
164	Please do
165	So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.
165	I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.
165	I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress.
166	I need a description of each of these assets asap - no more than one sentance on each.
166	Before 9:15am if possible on email so I can pick it up on Blackberry.
166	Thanks Louise
167	Please register Talk to Liz/Nicki to see if they want you to attend to help - only if you want to
168	Marcello is getting very frustrated.
168	Only Matthew is talking to him (all second hand).
169	Where's the answer
170	Gross margin per mmbtu for 2001
171	I think you need to push Wasaff

205	Dave Are you unwinding it?
206	thanks - stupid though isn't it!
207	Please set up a meeting with me, Geof and Steve Stock Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
208	Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.
208	Please could you ensure the numbers are both; (i) Correct, and (ii) Correctly allocated Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.
208	These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.
208	As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.
208	If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.
208	Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.
208	Thanks Louise
209	Here's my first pass on our 1-30.
209	Spreadsheet at bottom.
209	Number 2 Arnold Number 5 Presto Number 6 Sturm Number 9 Motley Number 10 Davis Number 11 Benson Number 13 Duran Number 14 Martin Number 15 Allen Number 16 Gonzales Number 18 Richter Number 19 Davies Number 20 Black Number 21 Herndon Number 22 Miler Number 27 Luce Number 28 Storey Number 29 Foster
210	Thanks
211	I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.
211	I added to your file schoolyard.
211	Our differences are: Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..
211	Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!
211	The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.
211	Your ordering is very P&L based.
211	Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey?
211	I added to your file schoolyard.
211	Speak to you later.
211	Louise Arnold Presto Sturm Davis, Dana Benson Herndon Motley Davies martin Richter Black Luce Allen Duran Storey Zipper Foster Ermis or Miller Gonzales
212	I see what you mean.
213	With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.
213	I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
213	I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.
213	Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
213	Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in. Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.
214	That works.
215	Stop working weekends again See you tomorrow
216	I wouldn't mind seeing your sofa if you still have it.
216	If you give me a time, I'll pop over.
216	Thanks Louise
217	Jean is still pushing to run wellhead desk, she may come and see you.
217	I have pushed back stating that we are much better placed to evaluate her outsourcing business as it is and that we will review this when we have seen sime dealflow.
218	yes to this i discussed with don
219	Fine
220	I'm fine.
220	Still laughing about co-president!
221	Probably not Hey Dave, can I have an update on originator track.
222	Could you please get Marcus Nettelton added to this.
223	thanks
224	Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins?
224	You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach.
224	When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat.
224	But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do.
224	Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss.
224	Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol.
224	An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice.
224	Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems.
224	Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices.
224	Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar.
224	Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.
224	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
225	Sorry Abigail - wrong person Trying to get Liz Taylor
226	I'm fine - don't worry.
226	Can you send a note out to all assistants making sure they all get the money back from AStros playoff tickets.
226	Tina very ill in St Lukes Emergency Room with possible heart attack.
227	we are struggling through we have elp from a lady Loretta.
227	Please help Dave tomorrow (if you are well enough to come back)
228	The only comment on the structures transaction slide is that (i) They are not from this quarter (ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
228	(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
228	(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.
228	Louise
229	Ok I thought it was in Washington state.
230	hi I don't have any - Jay Fitzgerald managed all of that for me and we closed the group down last year.
230	Sorry Louise
231	For diary By th eway was I invited to a PRC committee meeting last week.
231	I don't seem to have heard of it but LAvo said it was on WEdnesday or Thursday
232	Yes - good guy.
232	I think he is moving with Marcello into their new cross commodity group.
232	But he's bright, agressive and worth trying to get.
233	Can you resend me the doyle email from last week
234	As I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.
234	Louise
235	Have you done any deals yet?
236	I will Thanks
237	No to both.
237	Let's discuss.
238	Cris Bit of an issue here.
238	I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.
238	I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.
238	We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high.
238	Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.
238	Thanks Louise
239	Please move (when you get in tomorrow) Move Geof and Steve til Wednesday Move Hotte until end of week Move Calger to Thursday Thanks Louise
240	I found the meeting which was when I was in Chicago - please let me know when I am missing such meetings just for my information.
240	In this case I needed to know as I have a follow up meeting with John tomorrow Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
241	You need to give yourself some!
242	Could you let me know probabilities on your deals on the hotlist.
242	No rush.
242	Thanks Louise
243	It doesn't look like you were asked to do anything - just notifying you.
243	No is the answer though.
243	Thanks Louise
244	I think we are missing - Generation investments and Mitch Robinson's group.
245	Nope
246	Get the specifics we are organizing a meeting - need written examples - could you pleae co-ordinate a full list across gas and power.
246	Thanks
247	It takes a long time to get around to announcements - congrats anyway
248	I think its a good idea.
248	I thought a lot about it.
248	Spoken to Jonathan recently.
249	Had a meeting on 50.
249	How was it?
249	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
250	Can't remember whether I thanked you for this - if not - thanks for your prompt response.
251	I am also meeting with Robert on your contract - so we should get that done today.
251	Thanks
252	Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.
252	Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.
252	Louise
253	I think we are moving towards this concept.
253	Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA.
253	Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.
253	On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.
253	I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.
253	If you have a problem with this - let me know.
253	I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.
253	I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.
253	Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.
253	On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.
253	Sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal.
253	Louise
254	Thanks - I have used it already to Tim.
254	I mentioned the Beth concept - I'll let you know what he says.
254	Jeff Richter is too busy - he runs EES in the West.
254	Keep thinking though I like the idea of Jeff or Barry.
255	Did Howard attend - if so how's he looking?
256	Thanks
257	Feels better now
258	Its post earnings so no feeling on a day.
259	Nope
260	Same thing just prettier and with more details.
260	Suggest we send to HR for them to implement.
261	I don't just mean the logon I mean the domaine name too, once you are in EnronOnline you need to stay on www.enrononline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxx.
262	We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.
262	Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!): 0 - 5000 transactions per day $ 8:00/normal transaction (including internals) Options $ 10:00/ per option (using option grid) Take or Pay Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000 Service Interruption (outage) Reduction in our bill of $100,000 (less than 30 minutes) Reduction in our bill of $500,000 (greater then 30 minutes) Per product type set up 0 (its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA. It think this issue is for other groups.) On development 0 (its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.) Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades.
262	I think this is pretty close for us.
262	Only paying once for a sleeve trade.
262	Let the games begin!
262	Louise
263	I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.
263	We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).
263	They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.
263	Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.
263	Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub.
264	great - two please
265	we only covered commercial.
266	If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales.
266	He shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this.
267	This is great - two please
268	Great photos is that all that's left of EBS's people in London - how many did you have a one point?
269	Just in case you didn't know yet
270	Please could you do the following; Cancel today 4pm Weekly power meeting Tomorrow 4pm Frank Vickers Friday 10am Brian Redmond 4pm Brad Richter Thanks Louise
271	Brian Redmond or Jean Mrha will need to approve the budget as your number will be charged directly to them.
271	Brian or Jean please co-ordinate your response through Faith Killen.
272	Please tell them - that I am cancelling due to the Budget process.
273	Did you hear about Jonathan?
273	Louise Kitchen
274	Expenditure verification You have purchased some new computer screens - any particular reason when we all get in the new building?
275	There are a lot of people who are not Enron Americas - please cut them out?
276	Before Matt left he deposited a confidentiality agreement on my desk which dates back to August 6, 2001.
276	Jaime has it now.
276	What do you want me to do with it?
276	Sign it?
277	As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting.
277	My assistant is away so its just a misunderstanding.
277	See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.
277	I think losing Amita is a major error.
277	There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.
277	Thanks Louise
278	Today was the last date I discussed with Piper.
278	Before 4pm.
279	Dynegy to run Orig - in Europe working for Cardone.
280	Here's a little issue.
280	We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.
280	Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.
280	My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.
280	What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?
280	Thanks Louise
281	Looks like we are making outstanding progress.
281	This is great news.
282	Power trading or Origination spring to mind.
282	Power Trading is interviewing Tim tomorrow, do you want me to set something up for you too.
282	Forster is running one of the power origination groups, give hime a ring.
283	OK
284	Fine - how are you?
284	Baby not turning over yet because he's big!!!
284	Lots of people falling out of EBS aren't there.
285	How's Nadine and baby by the way?
286	He's 5 months, 19lbs and not rolling over!
286	90th percentile for weight, 50th height, 50th head circumference.
286	doesn't sound like it will be long before you have another one!
287	done
288	Just so you know
289	No concerns.
289	We managed to get about $40mm reduction the IT development budget, you are picking up some of the reduced budget (See Lloyd Will's email of earlier today).
289	Let Lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off.
289	Thanks Louise
290	is in town?
290	Are you seeing him - if so are you taking anyone from power?
291	I think we need to include groups with MPR where is was originated this year.
292	Do these match ours?
293	MAke sure we get at least 15% reduction.
293	Thanks Louise
294	Ok - I butt out.
294	EBS only has a handful left now and with redundancies over there they are trying real hard to place their people.
295	We need a back up plan for when you are away because Kim is away too.
295	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
296	Please arrange a meeting between ENA and EES asap.
296	Title: Coverage Attendees from ENA: Frank Vickers, Chris Calger, Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato, David Forster,Dave Duran, Barry Tycholiz Attendees from EES: Ring Kay Chapman to find out.
296	Early next week or end of this week.
297	let me know what he said
298	Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.
298	A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.
298	So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.
298	None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.
298	Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.
298	Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.
298	So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.
298	As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.
298	As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.
298	Thanks Louise
299	Can't wait to see you.
299	I think its a good choice.
300	Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.
300	We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities?
300	We need names etc. Split the list into areas Industrials in our SIC codes Utilities Munis Thanks
301	yup
302	No problem - the issue is I can never find you on the Address Book, because of the C. Louise
303	no - only if specified is my understanding, although on flat panels they are now trying.
304	well - what do you think of that!
304	I have someone who is a suplong Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
305	Scott just sent you the message before I'd finished.
305	So I have a real long shot for you to talk to at some point.
305	Matthew Scrimshaw - I don't think he'll move to Portland but he might.
305	So an ideas yourself?
306	nope
307	I would be - it was an email with Scott on my lap.
307	John's conversation with you today is what I am talking about.
307	If so - I have a hole, do I not in Portland.
307	So I know this chap MS who won't move to Portland but its worht you talking to him.
307	Should you decide to pursue John's conversation further.
307	Let's talk tomorrow.
308	Zippy trades under Arnold's but if you report to John and Michael you need V@R
309	Heads Up, I spoke to Jonathon this evening.
309	I confirmed that Dynegy had been speaking to Eric Shaw at length.
309	I think the only reason Jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money.
309	Speak soon
310	Houston, Texas Tel.
310	713.526.4700 Lunch Monday thru Friday 11:30-2pm.
310	Dinner Sunday 5:30-10, Monday thru Thursday 5:30-11, Friday and Saturday 5:30-midnight.
310	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
311	Hard times - but we're all behind you.
311	Keep going.
312	That is awful.
312	Poor little kid.
312	Do they think it was just another child?
313	This one is searching through expoense reports.
313	I have no interest.
313	Can you guys do this for John please.
314	When people request an understanding of gas or power - does this mean you ask people from ENA to give tours or speak or something?
314	Is there any role we play in hosting the event?
315	We're getting them back believe it or not!!!
315	They are ours again.
315	So its ok.
315	We got the merchant business back a week, we don't even know who made that decision but its our again.
316	Don't tell me - did you tell his nibs - it's his issue
317	How are these items progressing?
318	Can you invite Breslau and LaGrasta and Luce,
319	Yes - cancel Power origination Yes - cancel them going forward - John doesn't need them either at the moment
320	I would like to allocate the costs on everything going forward.
320	We need transparency on these events.
320	Thanks Louise
321	with not being able to access our own reports - this is the second time I have asked.
321	Please open up the reports to me.
321	Or is there someone else I should be asking?
322	Will do
323	It seems silly to have all of us going to dave as he is the only EES person attending Invite Frank, Laura, Tycholiz, Lagrasta, Breslau, Duran, Forster, Calger, Foster, Just in case we haven't invited any of them.
323	Thanks Louise
324	Thanks Can you get it from the price screen rather than the internet
325	John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.
325	Apparently,.
325	John was told that I had a problem with this.
325	I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,.
325	At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.
325	I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
325	I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.
325	Louise
326	Let me know if it goes any lower
327	Lavo called it, never mind though
328	Yup he can do it by phone
329	Do we have New York sorted out?
330	Did we get ours back?
331	How's the share price?
332	Would you mind doing the following 1.
332	Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless) 2.
332	Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks.
332	9:00am every second Saturday with Michelle.
332	I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the samr time as my manicure.
332	So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for amanicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.
332	The pedicure needs to be with someone else so its at the same time.
332	3.
332	Could you start working on the Trip to the uk at xMas.
332	I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to Kings Cross to get a train or go all the way home.
332	Depends on price.
332	Kelly Ferrari will have the name od ac chauffeur company.
332	I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead - could you try ringing her - she has a web address.
332	I am not expecting any of this today, but its nice to have things to look forward to.
332	Thanks
333	Any Messages?
334	Are you on the diet with me?
335	How far is that (the airport they usually fly too) from downtown.
335	It is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown
336	Let's stay downtown then.
337	They're not having the baby then.
337	Its still going on - quite boring though.
338	I am looking forward to the salad.
339	On my way bak
340	Don't know I have to go
341	venting
342	too late
343	all
344	I can perfectly see which reports I have access to and which ones I do not.
344	So please explain why all I can't see Enron Americas Position Report for example.
345	I was referring to all cost centers excluding HPL.
345	Regulatory does not need to be covered by you.
345	Here's my cut on Texas - do we need more?
345	You Director Manager Associate Analyst
346	The only thing I have to look forward to.
346	That'll be fine Thanks
347	Is it me and not Lavo due to him maybe not attending
348	I think the job may still be open next year.
349	Just what I needed!
350	I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.
350	I would hope for a major change in format.
351	Going out tonight
352	Forward to Tim Detmering Tim, How much money does Mariner have in the bank?
352	Please drop John and I an email.
352	Louise
353	Thanks I think they're behind us.
354	Sorry I completely forgot it was Wednesday
355	Does this still have capacity?
355	Can I put the West Desk's ERCs in this vehicle?
355	How quickly?
355	How much capacity is left?
355	Respond when you can.
356	yup
357	Don't we need the heads of all the power origination groups too
358	WE need to put them in. Ring me.
359	no
360	Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??) (i) Broker Margins Approx: $50mm Availability: End of Week Probability: 85% Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.
360	John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line which we are only using $15mm of).
360	I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.
360	Approx: $135mm Availability: Within month Probability: 50% We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.
360	(iii) Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).
360	Approx: $25.5mm Availability: Dependent on whether financing Probability: 50% If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.
360	The vehicle will be rolled next week.
360	(iv) Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank) Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.
360	So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.
361	I spoke to Chris on this today, we are covering Foster but not going to do anything on the others at this time.
361	We can review in another month or so.
362	LEt me know if you are planning any of these.
363	We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.
363	We are therefore holding a short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups.
363	Tammie to advise on the room.
363	Please invite all of your groups.
363	Louise
364	fine
365	I can bring back probably $45-50mm on Friday, by switching to Paribas.
365	Maybe more, Shankman is working on his margin too.
365	On Peoples -I'll get back to you tomorrow.
366	Cheers
367	Counterparties logging in: 891 External Users: 4726
368	It's really easy to assume that companies are closing positions and that's why there are so many trades.
369	Yes - Tammie still trying to find a room - can you let Frank and Laura's group know as they are out.
370	This meeting will happen this morning at 9:00am.
370	Tammie is still tring to get a room.
371	Is the rest of the stuff coming and when?
371	Particularly I am looking for OTC margin analysis with updates (including all counterparties and with October) and also I want to know the actual Nymex balance as off yesterday - I can see cash flows but not the balance.
372	New numbers for some people, could you please get these done asap including the new wording taking out any contingencies.
372	We are expecting them to start flowing in one hour.
372	Louise Matt Motley 1.30 Jeff Richter 0.90 Foster 0.20 Total
373	That's ok - he always has done
374	Great background - hope you are well.
374	Louise
375	Please give me the ENA individuals then as surely the whole point of ibuyit is forthem to do it themselves.
376	Jay has been pulling reports over the last couple of days and so far so good.

377	The question is - with our capital constraints - is he the right guy?
378	How's it going?
378	Any news after the revolver letter went?
379	It is evident that our customers continue to view Enron as a major liquidity provider in global energy markets.

394	Tyhis is very sensitive please leave it to Brian
395	I called tom at 830 this morning.

397	I have no idea what this is but don't do anything Fred until I find out
398	We need to talk about this month.
399	How are you doing with sierra pacific - I really need it?

404	This is a the high priority.
404	I have given Lisa all the resources.
404	We need this.
405	Lisa now has everything.
405	She Mauy have been told she had people but Nobody had started.
405	I will be checking up with lisa

407	What arr you up to with Vince
408	Please ring Lavo on 37991
409	In the budget numbers we had a headcount of 638.
409	I would like a list of all of those employees of Enron North America, with work numbers, home phone numbers, cell phones and pagers.
409	I would also like the same for EES wholesale.
409	It may be easy to do this by looking at the floor plans for the new buildings.
410	Not in the near future
411	Is it bad?
412	I am all over it
413	Not good really for me as I was finally hoping to get paid this year
414	go slow on this - in terms of closing ref money out the door
415	New onecoming tomorrow
416	ignore the other one
417	sorry missing the message When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.
417	Payments and payment dates please.
417	Thanks Louise Please say not soon too.
418	Attachment shows where we ended up.
418	I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL.
418	How does that hurt us?
418	It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too .
418	We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.
418	AEP sent us a very threatening letter.
418	Way outside of their contractual rights.
419	Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.
419	Also just to confirm no GTC changes on anything for the near future.
419	Thanks Louise
420	It never rains when it pours!
421	finally read it - I thought it was pretty crappy.
421	I am spending all my days in credit.
421	Head above water but only just.
422	Surely we can cover this from within Virgo's team?
423	WE are not sending the money - let's discuss.
423	Ring me if you can -I'm in the office Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
424	but we didn't include EOL - what's the story there?
424	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
425	What is that charge?
426	I need help - my home pc is down and unless I sleep in the office its not good.
427	No quite what I was looking for - I want to know the margin amounts (in /out and the imbalance
428	No support for Mexico.
428	Louise
429	I want to include all variation margin on this report too..
429	Please resend today's and include going forward.
429	Thanks
430	Can't be.
431	Sorry I won't be
432	1.
432	Poor guy - how is he?
432	2.
432	Inappropriate.

432	No interest.
432	5.
432	See Jeanie Slone - she has it.
432	6.
432	Get cash in. Thanks Louise
433	Prepays - although they do not terminate they do drop to zero collateral on a further downgrade.
434	2.
434	Cancel Thanks PRC is something we should do all in one day.
434	I'll let you know.
434	Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps.
435	What is the number?
435	I am very worried that you are sending a negative message on Enron out of the building.
436	It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.
436	I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us
437	Ray Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).
437	Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.
437	Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.
437	The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.
437	Thanks :Louise
438	Let's get on it really seriously tomorrow.
438	We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.
438	Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.
438	Louise
439	Rob, Let's discuss an action plan Louise
440	FYI Bill (Bradford) and I have a plan but the number is a bit higher than we thought.
441	Please organise a car to pick up my Mum and Dad at 4:15pm tomorrow to take them to the airport.
441	Thanks Louise Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
442	These guys tried the Ken Lay route.
442	Now they are part of your working group.
443	Not going well
444	Please update daily
445	I need a two bedroom
446	Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.
446	Long run not a short term solution.
447	Not included in the schedule is the $300mm of LCs expiring on 11/30.
447	Just so you know - but I think the decision is obvious.

458	fast for both
459	A. Combs - W. Power I will personally make sure we have Jim.
459	Please make sure these people are not severed.
460	Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.
460	Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders.
461	I meant rogue finance guys!!
462	You need to stay - I am trying to get us sold.
463	The same here now
464	Thanks for the note.
464	We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.
464	We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed.
464	Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.
464	Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.
464	I think it will be back though.
464	I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.
464	That must be first.
464	If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.
464	Take care & I will keep in touch.

465	We are doing commercial this morning, have we got the other numbers.

477	Need to co-ordinate with Greg Piper and Brad Richter
478	You're still there then.
478	Is Enron Europe in administration or liquidation?
479	Ben please deal with.
480	Ok - I think all the wrtie ups etc are fine - the only one would be EOL that is an issue.
480	But not the end of the world.
481	4 days is long enough.
481	I'll wait to hear from Carol but I believe we are ok.
481	It was sold - not sure on closing - you need to email rob milnthorp

483	Its coming
484	Let's not forget this one
485	I am going to ask Greg W if you can be included in NewCo, but I never really asked if you wanted to be.
485	Do you want to be?
486	I left you on Portland for now but obviously when we announce the strucutre it will change.
486	Duran does know though.
487	We do need a list tomorrow morning.
487	I am still in meetings.
487	Is is possible to email me questions.
488	Come and see me tomorrow.
489	Seems like a logical request.
489	Tell me 90 days is not serious??
490	All is officially crap here - I have worked 10 weeks straight no week-ends, all night and still its horrible.
490	Hope its better for you over there.
490	We have buyers - it's just gettting more and more horrible to be in the building - well actually in Houston come to that.
491	Please make sure Tom does does have any of hiis access shut off today by error.
491	He is not on list 3.
491	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
492	please contact Bob Macauliffe to make sure he doesn't have Tom cut off from an access and IT perspective.
492	Its important please make sure you do this immediately you get in. Thanks
493	Piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet.
493	EOL is not for sale today.
494	He would be a good addition somewhere - thoughts?
494	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
495	In the interests of full communication - here's an email I sent to EOL.
495	It's only a comment not a direction for Jay or anything - but it was a pretty sad read for me.
496	you are been estalked!
497	Any time tomorrow morning possible?
498	Give me a ring when you are on your way.
499	Thanks for working on this - I appreciate it.
499	Louise
500	I did
501	Let's get some time tomorrow.
501	Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain, Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.
501	Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.
501	Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too.
502	Shouldn't we have let this group go?
502	Why are we retaining them?
503	Pay
504	no holidays ------------------------ not even christmas
505	I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.
505	I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.
505	I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.
505	Can we discuss?
505	Thanks
506	I can send you people.
506	Jay Webb and Jenny Rub can do the rest.

508	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
509	Ohoh its all gone to ratshit!
510	We now have a structure in place dealing with Enron Americas estate and ensuring that we best maximize all of our contractual and asset positions.
510	This team will be headed by Don Miller going forward please help him and the team as this is our highest priority.
510	Some areas of this organization remain blank and will be completed by Don and the head of the appropriate business unit.
510	There are some areas which will also be dual tasking for a period.
510	Louise
511	What does that mean?
512	Firstly, I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.
512	Sorry.
512	Anyway EnronOnline: There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.
512	Two teams can be allocated for each.
512	It works - we have enough people to do it.
512	In terms of the Estate: The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.
512	The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.
512	We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.
512	Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.
512	In terms of NewCo: EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.
512	With its own staff.
513	I altered it.
514	You don't ever need to sell to me.
514	I'll let you know progress as we move forward.
515	Fine
516	Working name only
517	just rang me - they want to meet with John Sherriff and Joe Gold?????????????
517	What is going on?????????????

531	As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.
531	As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.
531	Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.
532	I read Anne's document - does that not work?
532	What is John Casaucoumeq's title?
533	I take it I do not need to do this?
534	Sorry its all prepetition.
534	I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.
534	I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.
534	The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.
534	Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with Enron once payments have been completed on expense checks.
534	OK?
535	Not quite sure where we ended up on this lot but clearly some of the below are Enron Europe's, so we do not need to bother with them.

537	To be honest you guys need to continue organizing this as we have no idea what is going on in the creditors committee - I didn't even know they were here until Mark rang me.
537	You can have whichever resources you want although Berney is EES.
537	I would suggest you continue to lead the effort though.

551	What day does it show I was paid for the flights to the UK?
551	I can't find the payment in my acco9unt.
551	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
552	This will slow us if we go this route.
552	I think the idea of an option to purchase is the best choice for us but probably difficult for you.
553	nah!
554	Let's discuss Thanks Louise
555	I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.
555	This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.
555	I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.
555	I may be wrong if this is a common problem.
555	I may never have been paid any.
555	Please check all expenses going back all year.
555	This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.
555	Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows: Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.
555	In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.
555	In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.
555	Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.
556	As I never used them - when do they get refunded - we then need to net off on expenses and reclaim the family ones.
556	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
557	So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.
557	Surprize!!!!!
557	So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.
557	Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.
557	The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).
557	A lot cheaper still than three business seats.
557	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
558	We will have a networked pc in the room - so choose if you want handouts or a powerpoint.
558	Kim will forward details of the room today.
558	Thanks Louise
559	Thanks.
560	He will obviously be finally moving to Houston then - clever move!
561	Have thought of a way around this.
561	- Find out as much as you can on why it happened and lets discuss.
562	The emails I sent out.
562	Please discuss the meeting and let me know the way forward.
563	Got it thanks.
563	It will be Greg Whalley and I attending.
563	Greg is President of Enron.
563	John is out but will attend next week should we prrogress.
563	See you tomorrow.
564	Thank you for all coming in this morning - I think it went very well.
564	Particular thanks to those of you who were supposed to be on vacation.
564	Please could you all send a copy of your presentations to Tammie Schoppe.
564	Thanks again Louise
565	We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.
565	So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.
565	Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- + Infrastructure Jenny Rub + Development Jay Webb + HR David Oxley + Cash Management Tom Myers + Credit Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly.
565	We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus.
565	John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration" plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.
565	The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.
565	I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.
565	Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.
565	Customer Side + Customers Phase 1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase 2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase 3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) + Action Plan Phase 1 Customers Phase 2 Customers Phase 3 Customers + Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) + Customer visit schedule Product Side + List of Products Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions IT transfer Louise
566	Oh oh - I suppose it all went to the other Bob.
566	I thought you were Robert L Hall Jr
567	Groovy thanks
568	What is the purpose of this?
569	Can you co-ordinate weather, reg and structuring.
569	I have some concerns we have missed out some weather models etc.
570	I would assume 30mm for planning purposes
571	Now you're in!
572	No attachment
573	Firstly, Dave is not responsible for the initial creation of these numbers which was done by Brad Richter before Dave joined the group.
573	I presume it was based on Brad's evaluations.
573	I suggest we wait another week to see the structure of the transaction before moving numbers.
574	We just need people to give us a week.
574	Surely they'll give us that long.
574	How are the new designs coming?
574	Did you and Avril have a nice Christmas - I am trying to reconnect my UK cell phone - I have been on the phone for 1 and half hours.
575	Just when you thought it was safe............................
575	We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.
575	The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.
575	The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.
575	HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.
575	But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.
575	All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.
575	We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).
575	As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.
575	Thanks
576	Ring each of the people on the list to make sure they know they have to produce the plan below by the end of the week.
576	Let me know who you have problems contacting.
577	Happy New Year by the way.
578	No real choice - apparently there was an issue with visas so Jay told them they could say no.
578	Let's revisit Wednesday.
579	I copied this email list and copied Rita Wynne, Stacey White by mistake which obviously I shouldn't have done.
580	Eric Moon resigned Haedicke Back in Elbertson Back in Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
581	East Orig was dessimated - we really need to staff up quickly.
581	Dave has some ideas of people and costs.
581	Can you get together on getting some people.
581	Thanks Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
582	ARe you still in?
582	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
583	No - this is a serious problem FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.
583	I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.
583	We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.
583	I'll be on the phone call - let me know times/numbers Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend
584	Handouts only.
585	Make sure all these people get to the meeting
586	Cool - we are ready.
587	No I did mean Duran - he told me he had a whole group of people we could bring in and he knew at what cost.
588	Tammie - please set up a meeting with Chris (he needs to be in a room in Portland for confidentiality) as soon as possible this morning - hopefully before or not long after the 9:30 (portland time power meeting) Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
589	Portland Meeting 11:30am Please could you attend.
590	You mean shouldn't be together - good point
591	If you are in - please can you come to my office if not Tammie please organize a dial in
592	I can't get attachments - please send teXt copy
593	Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want.
593	Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.
593	Will that work?
594	Please ask wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier
595	The meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.
595	I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC.
596	Can you ask Wes to bring the proforma too (15 copies)
597	Where's Jeanie?
598	Yes still need it -when are you back?
599	Can you get me the Calger letter done?
600	No surprize there
601	It is no probs
602	Can you talk to the appropriate commercial people and get them to decide?
603	I'm so sorry - hope things go ok
604	No The Weather group is the Meterologists and the Crude group are the original Fred Lagrasta marketers who were spun off under Randy Maffett - they will be brought back into the fold for gas marketing.
604	So we don't need mid/back office support.
605	FYI
606	No master on EOL.
607	Yes - all enabling agreements need to be included
608	Shawn We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.
608	I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.
608	However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.
608	In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
608	Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate) Present - January 10th, 2002 Complete filing documentation January 11th Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer) January 13th File and request an expedited process It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
608	Thanks Louise
609	Does seem a bit of an issue - who is in charge of this?
609	Robert?
610	Jim Steffes will be contacting UBS through you.
610	I did Citigroup (hope that's OK).
611	Is Barry Pearce in the list?
611	See below for alterations
612	The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.
612	Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).
612	I assume there are no problems but if so let me know.
612	Larry Hunter - Documentation Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination Larry Cash - Gas Settlements Jon Lewis - Risk
613	Thanks
614	I would like the Solitude, MT,USA photo.
614	Mounted but not framed.
614	Black mount.
614	60 inches.
614	I would like in exactly the same format as the one you sent me last Christmas of Field of Rainbows.
614	If you still have that one on record.
614	Do I get a discount as a returning customer?
614	What is the delivered price (including Fedex).
614	Thanks Louise Kitchen aka Louise Nettelton
615	It might help if I told you the shipping address!
615	Houston, Texas, USA
616	HR gave the list to me - I hope they are still getting paid
617	But what is her status now?
618	Is it coming back?
618	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
619	I needed the full list tonight - is this all I get.
619	We are assuming all pipes that we trade today.
620	It was someone for David
621	I'll sort
622	Organisational Charts have been requested by one of the potential Buyers.
622	Please send to Tammie by close of play tomorrow.
622	Thanks
623	No - please carry on.
623	UBS meeting went OK
624	Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.
624	All of that was before you were in. I had to plan.
624	I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.
624	Any thoughts?
625	It's long but good.
626	I definitely had a black mat last time.
626	I would like a black mat again.
626	In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.
626	So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.
626	MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald $1030.00 ($936.36 ex GST for o/seas orders) FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST) Freight $250.00 Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.
626	Thanks for your help Louise
627	East Desk????
628	Seems Marla is the contact.
629	Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.
629	They have to be offered out to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.
629	All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.
629	I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.
630	Draft EnronOnline Relaunch timetable Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
631	I have asked one of our deal team lawyers to send you a copy of the document.
631	Her name is Anne Koehler.
631	Regards Louise Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
632	I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.
632	Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.
632	That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer.
633	What happened to Don's salary?
633	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
634	Duran removed him - why was he not originally included?
635	Top 50 counterparties - can you send me the list?
635	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
636	I had a conversation with Richard Stuckey at Citi and he is still struggling with how to do teh EES carve out.
636	Can I make the following suggestion.
637	I think its the same again - can you come over for it
638	Do we include a 'confirmation' group in the plan - I am unsure where it falls on the front plan.
638	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
639	The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin.
639	Have we covered this function?
639	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
640	Can you do on gas and power together.
641	Rick, The list below is our Top 50 counterparty list.

642	We will be joining post another meeting so probably will not have time to get back to our offices.
642	Please feel free to phone in from whereever you like.
643	The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.
643	Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.
643	The PA is one page and the ETA several.
643	These are standard and not long.
643	Let's discuss tomorrow.
644	Did you do anything to it - I can't see.
645	No problem Thanks
646	I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.
646	We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.
646	What do you think?
647	Yup
648	This is our initial proposal.
648	Please feel free to contact Bill.
649	Shall we toss for who rings back?
649	Its going to be a long conversastion.
650	I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it.
651	I believe so Fine
652	The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales.
652	I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.
652	Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

655	Yes - I think Tycholiz sees less value but definitely worth a look
656	EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.
656	I really am not concerned about EES and retail.
656	I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.

659	Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.
659	Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.
659	Contracts Structure There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement).
659	The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer.
659	The other documents are accepted online.
659	PassWord Application (PA) The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance).
659	The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.
659	The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID.
659	The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline.
659	We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site.
659	The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch.
659	Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session.
659	Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers.
659	For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.
659	Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline.
659	When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed.
659	The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.
659	General Terms and Conditions (GTC) To be sent when the Buyer is known.
659	When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC.
659	The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity.
659	GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco.
659	Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required.
659	If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.
659	Password Application: Electronic Trading Agreement:
660	Cheers
661	We didn't manage to touch base.
661	Let's try again next week
662	Its the week-end so I am finally doing my emails.
662	I forgot to thank Leslie for doing these - so thanks Leslie it was appreciated.
663	CAn you get me the new list
664	Buyer to handle
665	We'll need to adjust then.
665	What did Donnelly say?
666	Sorry only just got to read this.
666	I sort of see EOL group as getting the customers to the point of being able to click and our marketers doing the masters.
666	Looks like we will not get approval anyway - see you Monday morning.
666	What did we send - it in or out??
667	Woops
668	I would hope that in the negotiations of the master we can remove the confirm provision.
668	Let's discuss Monday
669	Tammy Let's get together for 5 mins on Monday In general: Commercial and Energy Ops on 6.
669	5 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops.
669	Also we need a resort of the commercial teams Can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again.
669	Thanks Louise
670	We intend to send a copy of all restart plans to our new buyer - could you please format your accordingly .
670	Thanks Louise
671	Oh good - have you sent Presto's yet????
672	Did you revise this?
672	I can't find it - let's assume PAs and ETAs go out on 12th.
673	FYI
674	Chris I am sort of hoping you know about the deadline for start up plans - I know yours is slightly different but something needs to be done by tomorrow.
674	Thanks Louise
675	Who is doing the Gas Logistics restart plan?
675	Bob Superty hopefully
676	Why is he staying with the estate?
677	You will be sending me a plan tomorrow for all of Energy Ops though won't you?
678	My T1 is down Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
679	Jenny Can you sort this out for Mike today.
679	Thanks
680	Bob - would you sort out
681	Can I see them first?
682	cool
683	Are you sure - david and ellie's outbound flight is 1731
684	Hello, glad to hear you are well.
684	This all depends on who owns the domain name.
684	If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.
684	I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.
684	I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.
684	Take care Louise
685	Harry/Jay, can you help come to some conclusion on this.
686	Needs Duran alteration
687	Same with this one
688	Keohane or someone will be on their way to New York tonight.
688	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
689	Next Tuesday was tomorrow - could we try for Thursday as it really is onerous to get stuff through the new buyer.
689	Thanks Louise
690	In order to get Peoples up and running as soon as possible - we will need (as Netco) to enter into a service agreement with the Estate - can you set this up with Don or Jim.
690	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
691	Can we meet after we are sold - things are very hectic now.
691	How about some time in February?
692	Then you want Greg Piper - that is nothing to do with me.
693	EOL - if you mean the GTCs is in addition to the contracts below we require by Thursday.
693	Mark hasn't left me a message but I'll put a phone call into him.
694	Financial GTC Mark Taylor Thursday Financial Master Mark Taylor Thursday Physical Gas GTC Firm Mary Cook Thursday Physical Gas GTC Spot Mary Cook Thursday Master Gas Firm Mary Cook Tuesday Master Gas GISB Mary Cook Tuesday Netting Agreements Carol St Clair Thursday Power GTC Leslie Hansen Thursday EEI Master Leslie Hansen Friday Let me know if there are any problems.
694	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
695	Bob Superb Would you mind adding responsibility names to each.
695	Thanks Louise
696	I was envisaging something like the one talked about for Canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time.
696	Netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in Feb and March where the majority of the value is for this contract.
697	Where does this patent reside - in the Estate or NetCo?
698	diary
699	Are they coming?
700	This has got to be the last time.
700	Tomorrow morning a new team will arrive for due diligence purposes.
700	Tom Martin will be hosting this team The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows.
700	It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Tom .
700	9:00 Introduction John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 9:30 Financial Overview Wes Colwell 10:00 Risk Overview Buy / Port 10:30 Credit Bradford 11:00 Back Office Beck/Hall 11:30 Systems (EnronOnline) Jay Webb 12:00 Mid/Back Office Systems Jay Webb 12:45 Infrastructure Jenny Rub / Bob Afternoon Dataroom and Trader discussions Please make yourselves available.

700	The Maple Leaf is sending a team of 9 people.
700	They should arrive between 8 and 8:30 Wednesday morning and stay through Thursday evening (They are planning on a late night on Wed).
700	We are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room, but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group.
700	Please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings.
700	Louise Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

702	I hope this arrives today but just in case it doesn't - I thought I would let you know what it is.
702	Lots of Love Sis, Marcus and Scott Boy

703	Which one do you want prebooking - I would suggest 4/6 or 5/8 as one day you will be snow mobiling (it doesn't start until 3pm) Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
704	Why is this necessary in the first place?
704	I really do not understand why it is necessary.
705	There is a potential that counterparties will allow us to promote a small group of individuals simultaneous to deal closure.
705	To facilitate that process, please provide a list of those individuals you would like to promote along with a brief explanation to your HR generalist no later than 12:00 pm on Thursday, January 10, 2002.
705	Please keep in mind that the nominee should have been in his or her current role for at least a year and received a 3 or better rating during the mid-year PRC process.
705	Listed below are your HR contacts.
705	Gas Trading and Gas Origination Jeanie Slone Power Trading and Origination/EOL Amy FitzPatrick Tax/Accounting/Legal/Credit/Treasury/IT Infrastructure Sarah Zarkowsky IT Development Mandy Curless Your HR representative will be contacting you in the next day to review your employee lists as well as discuss any promotions.
706	Unless I am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal, does this mean we can do without this.
707	It is going to be really difficult to do the split, eg the EnronOnline patent is moving, can we take all of the history of concerning that which is on drives etc
708	Don't know!!!
709	Anne We need these for Netco - is it too late?
710	I sent you all your birthday stuff a day earlier just in case we lose our email for a day if it is taken down to be cleared.
710	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
711	I had presumed it got transferred - Wes could you please sort.
712	Its an IT security issue - ask Jenny or Bob what they think the plans are - it would be better if we were near peole.
713	Solarc is the system used for NGLs etc - we do not plan to convey it into NetCo.
713	In terms of the court case - the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy.
713	They did try and prevent the whole NetCo thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it.
714	What's your address?
715	Pat For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).
715	I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.
715	The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.
715	Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.
715	Hope this helps.
715	Louise Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
716	Recognize the truck?????
717	Issue keeps coming up - Disaster Recovery There is no number in our budget for Disaster Recovery either space or systems - big expense.
718	I'll just go with the black mat please.
718	Do I get any discount for repeat ordering?
718	Please order and mail (fedex).
718	Thanks Louise
719	another one to delainey
720	Could you pass to Don Miller Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
721	Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.
721	Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.
721	ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.
721	So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.
721	The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.
721	No-one has rung me yet.
722	Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.
722	Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.
722	It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.
722	Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.
722	In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.
722	Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.
722	We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.
722	Thanks Louise
723	Yup
724	Put in -its important Could you return my books
725	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
726	How long will it take?
727	Spoke to the deal team - they understand the economics and have gone to speak to Bill.
728	Ok great thanks
729	Margin requirementst substantially reduced if we have it.
730	Please get this printed - it is not formatted at the moment
731	We need to get the Exotica library - it's in the docs.
731	How do I get this done - it is in the deal.
732	No and no assurance should be given.
733	I suggest we kill this before the week-end.
733	Thoughts?
734	Wes Colwell
735	Fine - let him sort it
736	Conflicted - sorry
737	Can either of you open it?
738	Org charts were Netco as we haven't decided on who is in NetCo light
739	no that's fine
740	Any clue on numbers yet?
740	Top's support people are ringing our guys and telling them they want more people (legal)!
740	Bit of an issue when we'll be cutting.
741	No No
742	issue
743	Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.
743	My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.
743	Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone.
744	Expensed them.
745	Its the old NGL group.
745	I presume propane, butane etc
746	How is it going
747	Did you get tg back to 1yr docs
748	A bit of light entertainment!!
748	(See attached file: DoubleTree Show.ppt)
749	50% or less of the current group.
749	We have a market of 1 year = $x, so we'll need more cash for less people.
749	We may need our spare cash to fund the $12mm for the back office etc.
750	Current costs.
750	In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.
750	Gets us around the $200mm mark.
751	Jenny What is the cost issue?
751	This is a problem for timing of restart.
752	Can we have them until we move?
752	That would probably be the easiest time to give them up.
753	This amused me this morning!
753	Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a deserted road.
753	Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt.
753	The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"
753	The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies, "Okay."
753	The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page report on his high-tech mini-printer.
753	He turns to the shepherd and says, "You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."
753	The shepherd answers, "That's correct, you can have your sheep."
753	The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche.
753	The shepherd looks at him and asks, "If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?"
753	The young man answers, "Yes, why not?"
753	The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."
753	"How did you know?"
753	asks the young man.
753	"Very simple," answers the shepherd.
753	"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"
754	Good news - let's focus on getting the data this afternoon when we know the winner.
755	Excellent
756	If we have twins - doesn't it matter that we make more money for American Pie than we do with Hans - due to bigger group of people.
756	Therefore percentages need adjusting.
756	Or are we done?
757	Hey - fantastic news.
757	I am so pleased - take it easy.
757	Louise ps all still crap here
758	David Please remember Helen should we have an vacancies.
758	Helen We have been substantially reduced on our numbers by our potential buyers so at this time I believe that there are no vacancies but David will keep you in mind.
758	Good Luck Louise
759	I am thoroughly confused - we are not putting the master on line.
759	Where is the short form GTC?
759	Please provide short form GTC today - thanks.
760	We are swiss
761	dream on!
762	Where did he go?
763	Thanks - good job
764	Nightmare greg not back yet either so we still don't knoe real numbers
765	Still planning it - it might be just worth joining by phone to check the state of play
766	I agree but I don't know whether that is public
767	I thought Port rang you hours ago -= he said there had been changes and he would ring you.
767	His cell is 7134172565 His home is 2812921469
768	Colette, Could you possibly let me know if we need a tax group here.
768	Thanks Louise
769	Tammie Please email to Tim and Chris's houses too Could you ring Milly with it.
769	Thanks
770	So far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.
770	Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 - 15 less in Jay's area).
770	I think it would be a good idea for you to come down and have dinner with either myself or myself, Jenny and Jay together tomorrow.
770	Hutch is coming down tomorrow night.
770	Regards Louise
771	In a meeting with your guys now.
771	See you tomorrow.
771	Louise
772	We will be managing our rates we need to plan on a software.

773	And also can you start planning to have infinity up and running on day one.
773	Thanks
774	If we cut the people in red - HR would have you at 56 people - what is right?
774	AMy - please find the difference
775	Tammie - get each of these people over to the Houstonian to meeting with UBS - Mike Hutchins and Ken in the Lacewood Room, Houstonian.

780	Vail Sports Vail Colorado 81657 Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas

784	27th - Marcus family - first time they have seen Scott 30th - at the embassy all day for green card So how about afternoon of 29th?
785	We are clearly close to completing the new numbers - could you work with Jeanie and Amy to put a new plan together.
785	Do we have any corporate allocation number from UBS?
785	Thanks
786	Unfortunately - these guys did not make the cut this week-end.
786	Jeanie, can you please ensure this is dealt with.
787	Congratulations!
787	Have a good sleep.
788	Did he find it or was it handed to him?
789	I am going to have Jim report to Haedicke with all of his people having a dotted line to the commercial desks - any issues let me know.
790	Not for sale - sorry.
790	Hope you're well.
790	Louise
791	No arrangements - he just hasn't had a good year.
791	On a comparative basis I can't justify more.
792	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
793	Just thought you may like to see the proposed look of our new website.
793	Do you want the W?
793	We presume you do.
793	Louise
794	Jim Please confirm it is ok for Vince to release source code to Jay Webb (Enron).
794	Thanks Louise
795	Long and boring story - at about 12 we got those admins but their were no numbers in them - zeros.
795	DAVID AND I sent them back - it doesn't change the numbers.
796	Nice but he avoided the question.
797	but we do have the 'w'.
797	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
798	We need to do the move - can we meet today?
799	$50mm per annum
800	FYI
801	I am tired...........................................................................................................
802	We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.
802	We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.
802	David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.
802	Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.
802	Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.
802	The meeting will be in John's office.
802	Thanks Louise
803	Message understood - we will try and accomodate Derek Have a good week-end.
804	Please email me the ruling when you have it.
804	Thanks Have a good week-end
805	I will start drinking heavily.
805	I propose a huge night out when you get back!
806	Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.
806	We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.
806	We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.
806	Are you going?
806	Louise
807	David please make sure all team leaders have this or a smaller version.
808	I agreed terms with greg can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at 2pm.
808	Thanks Get then to ring greg if nec - I really want to be able to tell people I've signed
809	not at the moment - we have 160000 spare (assuming schweiger is in)
810	Everything has been somewhat confusing recently and I made a hasty decision to put you reporting through Legal (decision prompted by the community relations comment) - there will a dotted line into the desks.
810	I hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks - it really has been Lou Eber dealing with all the reg issues.
810	I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in UBS.
810	Did you get your contract?
810	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
811	What's your phone number?
812	You might want to ring Port - he wants the same numbers as Bill Bradford - so double what he has now.
812	There is a lot of disclosure around and so he thinks after he had bad treatment in the bonusses - the same is happening now.
812	His number is 281 292 1469.
813	Well that's ok if we don't - I have no idea what Stockman's view is and heis back tomorrow.
813	Its easier to control money if we have the conversations.
813	Currently at the drug test - there is a long list of people from ene who have been here today.
814	Did you see Laura's message.
814	It reads like she is in. Currently at the drug test place there are lots of ene people on the list
815	Tried to call but couldn't reach you - I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them.
815	I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news.
815	I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming.
816	I saw an offer letter to teresa staab so if we didn't give it to her its on the reserve list somewhere.
816	David - did it go out?
816	If so whitt is done
817	Ok by me.
818	As shankman would say 'working ya'
819	Hunter says Bass is in.
820	What are they having?
821	stop by my office.
821	We want you in the new company.
821	We have really been trying to get you happy.
822	They need power contracts at start - no need for a power marketing licence in ERCOT Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
823	I haven't asked Hunter - let's discuss in the morning.
823	If motley is in we are out of money.
823	I think you need to pay up for Foster- the lone marketer
824	Need all those docs printing today.
824	Also can you please check on why I have not being reimbursed by Continental for the flights at Christmas.
824	Also - expenses - what is the situation.
824	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
825	What decision was made?
825	I have no idea.
826	Yes
827	Did we get sign off from Jim Petrie?
828	see Tammy Shepperd.
829	BP just hired someone - can they do that?
829	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
830	Troy Black
831	Dear Linda I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.
831	We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.
831	I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.
831	I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.
831	I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.
831	Regards Louise Kitchen
832	Ouch
833	We are off to the UK in a couple of days so we'll come and see you when you get back.
834	What's his problem?
835	I think he'll be done at his current offer, do you want to give him more?
835	I told him he's reporting to you and Milly and he was pleased.
835	Are you listening or video conferencing into this meeting?
836	We need to add the word energy to the 'ubs warburg' on the top left hand corner of our screen.
836	So it reads UBS Warburg Energy.
837	We would really like some UBS signs for the trading floor - can we take the ones you have here?
838	What happened?
839	Great thanks
840	Tammie Get all the assistants to do it by the week-end
841	Have them delivered to Jim Derrick and explain that they are Fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office.
841	I don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now.
841	Thanks Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
842	There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.
842	Mark please help resolve.
843	This seems to be the best way of getting on top of all the meetings.
843	Let's discuss.
844	Get ready to fax to me
845	We need a copy of whatever they are looking at.
846	As I am out if you need anything please contact Oxley directly.
847	What is the name of the website where all of this information resides?
848	I totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline.
848	Jim please confirm to Vince you are happy.
849	80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.
849	We need to give them a defined group for day 1.
849	I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from londonyesterday and he agreed to put someone here froM day 1 capable of making decisions I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start coMpiling the next list On the plane doors closing
850	Chase back office and their restart plan updates individually
851	We will need to allocate individual seats early next week.
851	Don't worry about john on offices we are done.
852	Cool
853	There is a god
854	Crystal Are you ok?
855	Sorry missed this one - david this was done wasn't it?
856	We are delayed got another 30 mins on the runway.
856	I hear tim has huge problems.
857	Do we have anyone in portland?
858	Iam on a plane sorry
859	I have no idea
860	Wahey on curry
861	I'm fine " check with Haedicke
862	We need to send read only ids to all our customers.
862	Did we plan that?
863	Groovy
864	No there will be plenty of others
865	Let's leave it until we get going.
866	Did you find Liz - if you did is she ok?
867	You're right - typo
868	Is she done yet?
869	If you are awaiting a visa and seconded to ubs - can you ttrade
870	Cheers
871	Love it
872	Oxley - shouldn't think its a problem I mentioned it on Friday.
872	David please sort out - if there is difficulty contact Pat
873	We'll see you at about 4pm is that ok?
873	On cell 07778757656 - flying tonight.
874	Big - a whole floor with no pillars.
874	Got to be the most expensive place in the world to live.
875	Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy.
875	Tammie will co-ordinate dial ins etc
876	Tammie Please could you set up the meetings (apart from the Thursday one which UBS already has arranged. Contact Dave Forster and co-ordinate with him. I couldn't forward you the email I sent but it was just to the 8 commercial MDs in UBSWEnergy. Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails. Thanks Louise
877	Don't worry - you're not supposed to let go while I'm away.
877	Speak to you later
878	I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.
878	I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.
878	Can you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.
878	I am contatable on 07778757656.
878	Thanks Louise
879	I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.
879	Will your people mopve to Houston?
880	Agreed
881	Give Chris Calger a ring if you are serious.
881	I hope you're not.
882	Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster Hello I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.
882	I am really getting worried on timing.
882	Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.
882	Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.
882	I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.
882	So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
882	Thanks Louise
883	Simply People, systems and floor space.
883	Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.
883	WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.
883	You could get most of it from Reuters.
884	As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.
884	Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.
884	Thanks
885	Really you need to do it.
885	Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.
885	Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.
885	Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.
885	I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.
885	STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ?
885	(ask legal).
885	Leave binders,etc for now.
885	Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).
885	Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.
885	Liz can cover - have a great time.
885	Pick up your tickets early in the day.
886	3 & 4 are better than where we are now.
886	The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.
886	The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.
886	But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building.
887	Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though.
888	Yes but no counterparty names.
888	Jay has it all.
889	That's fine - I;m back in tomorrow
890	We are assuming we will be physical on Monday Feb 11 in Canada.
890	Let me know if there is an issue.
891	What would be the cost of moving etc - all the new infrastructure etc. When you say cheaper what do you mean - all in including moving etc. We obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move.
892	I really think Jeff is a bad choice - let's discuss.
893	Are you working on the new Contracts?
894	None exists today.
895	On the phone
896	Is it written yet?
897	Not for Canada -- for the US
898	What's wrong?
899	Both interruptible and firm.
899	Thanks
900	No absolutely not
901	Where are we with www.enrononline.com?
902	Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names.
903	No reason I can see
904	great news
905	Friday unfortunately - I asked for earlier.
905	Lavo asked the same question
906	not yet
907	Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.
907	I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.
907	Kevin - what about South East power?
907	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
908	On the people - we are planning for a group to start Mopnday pm as it is not as urgent as teh credit wording for this Monday.
908	Let me know if I can help.
909	ARe you in the office?
910	Can you check on my flight reimbursement?
910	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
911	is outstanding (I think anyway)- can we hire him?
911	Maybe in Reg?
912	Thanks for your work on this.
912	I can't wait for the UBS discussion on WSPP!!!!!
913	Just give us a time.
913	Thanks Louise
914	Great news
915	Yes
916	OK
917	Do you really have someone as capable as Marcello.
917	This is an outstanding trader who we probably have no chance of getting but could run any desk we have.
917	Is your SE guy of that quality?
918	I am trying to fiind out that date I became a member of the IOD and secondly if I still am.
918	Please could you let me know as soon as possible.
918	Thanks Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
919	My contract is in Kitchen and I have done the drugs test, benefits etc in Nettelton.
919	can you sort - thanks.
919	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
920	Hello Glad you got yourself sorted with a new job.
920	Things here are getting better - we have nearly closed with UBS, so I hope to have a new job next week.
920	Still in Houston.
920	Are you trading - if so what?
920	Take care Louise
921	1.
921	Front Office - We had several I have no idea whether we brought any of them with us as they were never used.
921	Back Office - Global Counterparty Database.
921	2.
921	We are planning a seminar for Thursday pm already - credit are sending me their presentation (hopefully tomorrow), I think its a great idea but I would like to see it first so we can decide on the audience.
921	3.
921	Thanks 4.
921	Great idea.
921	5.
921	See you tomorrow.
921	Thanks Louise
922	Good idea - let's try for that in their systems.
922	Its really only a question of my pay checks and expenses bouncing.
922	Had a crap week-end filling in my SEC background questionnaire - hope yours was better.
923	I think this is one for you Anne - can you help?
924	We are going to ask Kim's group to help pull information for credit (public domaine information) in order to help accelerate the credit process as his group is heavily stretched at the moment.
925	Working Ya (as Shankman would say).
925	It appears they will offer guarantees but I am awaiting confirmation.
926	Thanks for your swift assistance.
927	Pat O'Donnell mentioned that you guys have an issue with starting on power - what is it?
927	Thanks
928	Canada appears to be an issue.
928	We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd. With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.
928	There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.
928	Please let me know how we can progress on this.
928	Louise
929	I'm working it - do not worry
930	I thought we did establish Product Control on Friday - let's just deal with Dave issues on priorities as we catch them between us.
930	Did you meet with Kim?
930	Thanks Louise
931	Greg, Mark and I met with the Estate this morning and Canada did come up in terms of the Transistional Services agreement.
931	Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.
931	How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.
931	I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.
931	In terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.
931	Peter - tried to ring you.
931	Give me a call when you are free.
932	2024247643 is the fax.
932	Please fax and courier original.
933	Thanks Louise
934	Still seeking response.
934	Can you help
935	Did we get from Lisa the appropriate internal account opening form from Lisa yet?
936	Has Brian had his contract yet?
937	Any news from Redmond?
938	Redmond 175:175
939	Any interest in chatting about a job at UBS?
940	I'll ask he just came by
941	That may be the same for BR
942	What happened to savita
943	diary
944	we need a big party organizing for everyone - please sort.
944	Thanks
945	Yup
946	Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
947	We don't need to use the Special events people.
947	Obviously I don't have a corporate card.
947	Collette - help!
948	No attachment
949	Where do we get the headcount room from?
950	Please send out both numbers and codes
951	Absolutely - thanks
952	Ok on Sachs I think that's a real problem with their money - how much each and how are the people?
952	Essentially - how material?
953	We'll need the headcount for commercial people and I know Legal want their assistants.
953	Hire them as contractors through an agency
954	Fine by me.
954	The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning.
955	I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.
955	I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.
955	Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.
955	The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.
955	Thanks for your late and long hours.
955	Louise
956	No questions - nice to emeet you.
956	We will probably start with Alex at 2:30pm
957	Lou This is the issue concerning encumbrency (Sp?) certification.
957	Louise
958	True - oops
959	Just a couple of suggested changes to both.
959	There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.
959	Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.
959	We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.
959	On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.
959	Do you need all of the commercial MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?
959	Thanks Louise
960	This is the procedure which currently is documented in the Product Control Function concerning the validity of a signature.
961	Anything that has areas requiring information to be filled in can obviously not be.
962	I don't think I do - I thought Elizabeth said she would use a reference document - not the EEI.
963	This is just commercial - let me know if you want the rest.
964	It doesn't work - either get something which does or set up a meeting
965	www.ubsenergy.com isn't working Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
966	No money has been paid into my account in expenses ever - where is the money going.
967	Is that all of our originators or just heads?

969	Can you come to my office and let's do it.
970	It appears that the following email may not have been clear.
970	You have to do this yourself.
970	This is my cheat sheet if it helps.
970	H Drives: 1.
970	Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.
970	2.
970	The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.
970	O Drives: 1.
970	For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O. The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.
970	Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.
970	Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.
970	Louise
971	Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.
971	As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.
971	Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.
971	Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York.
972	Can you make sure Marcus Nettelton has three screens.
972	One pc and two screens.
972	Thanks Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas
973	Yes
974	One pc - 3 screens Thanks

975	And resend to me Thanks
976	They have the rights - can you facilitate.
976	Thanks
977	Great - no changes
978	approved
979	How was it - we are really busy so I thought I would ask in case i don't get to see you too much tomorrow.
979	You were missed
980	Yes - I figured you would be doing the translation tomorrow - I can help if you like.

236	i would like the broncos newsletter
237	wild west sucks.
237	the only good thing was that there was $1 beers.
237	i hated country music and there were a ton of necks there.
237	how was that movie?
238	looks like i will get to denver tues, aug 8th in the afternoon and leave thurs aug 10 in the afternoon.
238	i wont have much time but we will figure something out.
238	i have to work in the mornings out of the denver office and then we have some seminars to go to in the afternoon and some golf tourneys.
238	i will figure something out and let you know.
239	what is the current head count on this trip?
240	it wasn't that bad.
240	i didn't get my ass kicked by some rednecks so it was ok.
240	you going out this week?
240	i might go out thurs.
240	if not we will hit downtown this weekend.
240	i will even drive my gremlin out.
241	i will have a little time.
241	one night you will have to hit the town.
241	drinks on the corp card.
242	it was scary but terrible?
242	how was volcanoes?
243	two steppin' is for people who cant dance & i am a great dancer so therefore i do not two step.
244	you guys like the worst places.
244	wild wild west, surf side sally's.
244	please tell me that the party won't end up at "shock 2000: the radioactive dance factory".
244	just let me know the plans & i will be there.
245	volcanoes was full of hotties?
245	i should have been there.
245	i might skip adrians and meet up with everyone later.
245	i hate adrians.
245	who knows.
246	you hate erika also.
247	chad is not going b/c he is in a wedding.
247	tim said he is a game time decision, so i wouldn't count on it right now.
248	i will probably go to woody's thurs if i have a good week.
249	why aren't you going?
250	tell him to take us out on it.
250	how much does a boat like that cost?
251	i am definately going to the tenn game.
251	i am going to try to make at least three games.
251	it is hard to do these trips as a student with no steady income.
251	give me a call when you get a chance.
252	i will try to get those names for you today.
252	if i don't do it today just remind me and i will get it done asap.
253	you going to vegas.
253	i just got my ticket.
254	i would sell my house and move on the boat.
254	i would probably buy a pet alligator to keep on deck to protect my property.
254	golf this weekend if i don't have sailing lessons.
254	they bagged me on the lessons last weekend.
255	send me that picture again.
255	i accidently deleted it.
256	you are an 832.
256	i would try to get that changed as quickly as possible.
256	you don't want to be an 832.
256	i did get your message.
256	you love that song don't you?
257	yeah but i am not going to tell people you are an 832.
257	if you meet a guy don't give him that number right away until you thinks he likes you b/c that could be a deal breaker.
258	i have a late basketball game tomorrow night that i forgot about.
259	probably around 10.
259	if not tomorrow definately thurs.
260	who cares about the last 4 digits?
260	it is the area code that matters.
261	just in case you didn't see it- 4 broncos made the 1st team all decade team.
261	elway is the starter and your boy in sf didn't even make 2nd team tim.
262	you say brister could make the all decade team throwing to rice and young couldn't?
262	that is not saying much for your boy.
262	he is better than brister, just not elway.
263	do i need to stop using my previous i.d.
263	and password and use this instead?
264	i just found out that i get in tues afternoon and leave thurs afternoon.
264	we will try to get together at least once.
265	i am going there for basically two days the second week of aug.
265	i won't have much time.
265	hopefully i will meet them for lunch or something but it is definately going to be a short visit.
265	at least i will be back two weeks later.
265	did grandma get her truck?
265	hopefully you and billy can make it over labor day weekend.
265	i just bought a new car.
265	it is actually a used chevy tahoe.
265	i love it.
265	it is so much nicer than the jeep.
265	it is too nice for me but as long as i am meeting my goals in savings each month i think i can afford it.
265	hope all is well.
265	tell billy hello.
265	matt
266	i am probably going to go to woody's
267	if anyone is up for getting some drinks at woody's tonight i am in. i am going to test my new theory out tonight: hot school teachers don't have anything to do in the summer so they go out to try to meet guys with careers that can support them.
267	it is actually just a hypothesis at this point, but sierra on wednes.
267	has added support.
267	let me know if you are in. and remember it is the in the name of science.

273	how was woody's when i left?
273	who all is going out with you on sat?
274	me, chad, this dude steve and maybe a straggler or two.
275	are there any hotties coming?
276	how is everything in south florida?
276	things are busy here.
276	i am not storming the campuses for sorority chicks, but that isn't a bad idea.
276	email me your phone number again & i will try to write it down this time.
277	that is funny
278	I have a question on the generation number we are pulling from your database.
278	The hydro numbers are coming in positive and negative.
278	Could you please explain the difference there when you get a chance.
278	Thanks for your help.
278	Matt Lenhart
279	here is your test.
279	don't lie.
280	happy belated birthday.
280	i will try to call tonight.
280	i was playing golf and didn't get home until 9 last night and went to bed.
281	yeah.
281	don't mess with texas.
281	i didn't know you called.
282	$50.
282	not much for a shooter like me.
282	i will probably win it tonight at liars poker.
283	you don't think the saints will make the playoffs now?
283	just this past weekend you were telling me that your in depth analysis led you to conclude a playoff berth for the saints.
283	you don't want to back up those statements after the saints preseason opener?
283	it sounds like every saint fan in august: predicting the playoffs in august and wearing a paperbag on your head by week
284	you spelled sholes wrong.
285	worked good.
285	i downloaded a few songs from scour.com into your network.
285	they are under c:\program files\napster\music.
286	are you going to buy or just cheer it on?
287	did you change your number?
287	i called once left a message.
287	there wasn't a greeting on the machine so i don't know if you got it or not.
287	i will be in town tues afternoon and i leave thurs afternoon next week.
287	hopefully we can get together for lunch or breakfast.
288	what city is that area code from?
289	actually i am staying at the adam's mark hotel downtown.
289	i will definately be able to see you guys at least once.
289	i am not sure what the schedule is so i will just play it by ear.
289	i wish i was coming in for the weekend, but the tickets were twice as much and they don't want to pay for my vacation.
289	call me tonight & i will let you know details.
290	you're hurting my feelings.

312	i am going to take rodell meally.
312	he can recover from that acl quickly.

318	i was in denver.
319	i would go but i need to save money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.

329	maybe golfing tomorrow.
329	you still going to austin?
330	that made my day
331	there is no need to redraw
332	we are not redrawing just b/c hoskins quit and the guy with the last pick wants to get a better position.
333	i won't be able to pick up griese if i don't have the first pick
334	i think he could go to the pro bowl and start ahead of manning this year.
335	can you follow me to the car dealership at lunch tomorrow at lunch so i can drop off the tahoe to get fixed?
336	i hope you miss that tropical storm in the gulf.
336	cant believe that there would be any hurricanes this time of the year out there.
336	did you see 'the perfect storm'?

462	i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole office.
462	the defense is a major concern.
462	i am torn between being impressed with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out b/c of that defense.
462	st.
462	louis had a good defense last year.
462	i hope their defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense.
463	how was your labor day.
464	the defense couldn't even stop them.
464	they have no place to go but up.
464	i am concerned about the d.

517	they told me to send in the resume to h.r.

541	what is up with cu?
541	they suck.
541	i'm not going to run my mouth about the broncos b/c i don't want to jinx them.
541	defense will get better as they play more.
542	call me back.
542	i accidently hit a button on the phone to disconnect.
543	i am in. do you need anyone else to play b/c chad wants to play if we have room.
543	we could always use another pass rusher.
544	are the softball games tues nights?

552	so you are going to just stay in and tame the shrue all night
553	sounds like you would be calculating a book each day.
553	it might be a good entry into trading, but i would check with them on how they have their program set up to get people into trading positions.
553	let me check with h.r.
553	today.
553	they move slow.
553	i would ask some questions on that posting to find out where it would put you eventually.
553	trading is the way to go.
553	more money in trading and your opportunities would open up throughout the industry.
554	i think she is in. i would stay away from scheduling.
554	you definately don't want to do that.
554	we might go out tonight to sierra.
554	i will let you know.

601	i didn't have my phone with me there.
601	it was so much fun.

601	where did you watch it?
601	it sounded like you were partying some.

607	i thought i was in great shape.
607	i was dancing better than menudo.
607	i was hurting when we left sat.
607	i almost puked in my car when i was driving back to houston.
607	going back to football games is so much fun, but the drinking kills you.
607	i haven't drank that much for that long in a while.
607	it was worth it.
607	i am tired today, but it is nice for everyone to say how we kicked ass this weekend.
607	i still can't believe you didn't get tickets.
607	i had extras.
607	i could have hooked you up.
607	i heard brittney spears was at fred's on sat night.
607	did you hear that.
607	not that i am a fan of hers, i just heard that.

608	i will try to call you tonight or tomorrow.
609	sounds good.
609	how long would we stay in cancun?
609	i don't think i can take 2 weeks again this year.
609	i could meet you in n.o.
609	and we could fly from there or if you have to go to cancun through houston i can meet you here.
609	i will try to call tonight after my softball game.
609	hope all is well.
610	have you ever been to monterey, cali?
610	i get to go there in two weeks for a pipeline meeting.

611	this weekend will probably be low key.
611	i am sure i will go out sat.
611	what are you doing?
612	i am down in the crowd somewhere.
613	i dont remember monterey.
613	i think i missed it when i was curled in a ball in the back seat freezing my ass off.
613	i cant wait.
613	i looks awesome.
614	i am playing golf one day.
614	i am going to fly into sf and drive down the coast to monterey.
614	should be nice.
615	i ran on the field.
615	it looked awesome.
615	i had a blast.
615	it was one of the top 3 games i saw at tiger stadium.
616	it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well.
616	anyway, men get distinguished as they age.
616	i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep my hair.
616	i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed.
616	that is the best time to be at that place.
616	i do feel better at work today.
616	i found out i get to go to monterey, cali in two weeks for a boondoggle.
616	it is all paid for and all i will do is booze and golf.
616	i look foward shit like that now.
616	you should be going out every night while you can.
616	one day you will hit the real world and you can't do that.
616	lsu is not the real world.
616	you can still party a lot while you work, you just have to be in pain at work and pretend like you are not hung over so they don't think you have a problem.
616	i usually go out 2-3 nights a week.
616	i try to live like a rock star (like britney spears).
616	email me back when you get a chance.
617	what is up?
617	i didn't have your email.
617	anyway, i think you called last night and i answered and i could hear you talking to somebody, but you couldn't hear me saying hello.
617	dirty george does some sick shit.
617	he lost his hand up his ass the other day.
617	how is the new job?
618	are we on for drinks with the hottie?
619	cool bra.
619	what is up for the game this weekend?
620	do you get to go to ny ever?
620	sounds good.
620	are you going to start working
621	i have a joke for you.
621	Q: what two words clear out a men's bathroom faster than anything?
621	A: nice dick
622	i don't listen to nsync.
622	i like color me bad more.
622	they are more my speed.
622	they have a more mature sound.
622	you don't know what a boondoggle is?
622	a boondoggle is where another company takes you on trip to discuss business over golf and booze.
622	they pay for it all and it is usually fairly extravagant.
622	they make this job worth it.
622	i am having a shitty day.
622	i am losing a shit load of money.
622	do you go out every night or something?
622	you are living the wild life.
622	what are you taking the gre for?
622	what the fuck is the gre for anyway?
622	is that the grad school test?
622	what is your major?
622	i can't remember what you told me.
622	speech something?
622	where are you going to grad school?
622	lsu?
622	talk to you later.
623	you must be a hoodoo for the tigers.
623	i went in for the tenn game.
623	it was awesome.
623	you dont realize how good we had it at school until you leave.
623	check out md anderson.
623	it is the top cancer research hospital in the country.
623	how is everything going there?
623	i talked to our babe kelsey walker a couple of weeks ago.
623	she was in houston for a bachelorette party.
623	she is still hot.
623	i also saw brooke and emily last weekend.
623	brooke looked good.
623	i am planning on going to jacques wedding.
623	when is it?
623	what lsu games are you going back in for?
623	i am definately hitting the bama game and possibly miss st.
623	talk to you later.
624	i spoke to her yesterday.
624	if she doesn't get you an interview with that guy she is going to get you one later.
624	game at tim or val's.
625	sounds good.
626	we can bring some shit.
626	is this girl from the same town as celeste?
626	i am trusting you that she is hot.
626	i don't want to show up for some drinks and have to sit next to some troll.
626	well just let me know.
626	we can get drinks any night next week.
627	i think mitch is going to come over also.
628	i just got a 46.
628	my mom is so proud she raised a good boy.
629	see how you do on this test.
629	let me know your score.
630	how did you lose 26 points from the last time you took the test.
630	you cannot pretend some of that stuff didn't happen.
631	i actually scored a 96.
631	that is respectable.
631	it doesn't make me a dope addict or dog lover so i am comfortable with it.
632	i didn't cheat like you did.
632	there is no way your score can go down on this.
632	i think you need to retake it and be honest with the test and be honest with yourself.
632	let me know what you really score.
633	did you see the debate last night?
633	i was impressed with cheney.
633	i thought he was more impressive than either presidential candidate.
634	wade might show up if that is ok
635	i tell him to bring some food
636	i am not going fucking ice skating.
636	that fag might be.
636	i think there is a power trader named rogers herndon.
636	why?
636	so what are you doing this weekend?
637	we should go get some beers after work at that new place near tim called the station or something.
637	let me know if you are in.
638	whenever.
638	i am ready to go now.
639	you won't be able to throw me when you are on ice skates boitano.
640	give me a call at work or at home when you can go.
641	i didn't bet with her.
641	she still owes me $50.
641	we came back to reality.
642	you didn't miss shit on saturday.
642	merc room was full of nothing but cougars.
642	it was a waste.
642	we need to hit this place called toc.
642	i heard that it is great.
643	texas sucks huh?
643	how was your weekend?
644	do you guys want to play golf sat morning?
644	let me know and i will get a tee time before the game.
645	somewhere decent.
645	if you want in i will get a tee time today.
646	damn!
646	you got a 112?
646	did you answer yes to the animal sex question?
646	i scored lower than you.
646	i scored a 96.
646	my mother would be proud.
646	i am just an angel.
646	you should move to the french riviera.
646	i think i am going to do something similar.
646	i need to go anna nicole and marry a rich old woman and move to the carribean.
646	i think i could quit work and become some old blue hair's boy toy.
646	i would only be a couple of years.
646	i would probably be able to get a girlfriend on the side who is more my age.
646	all i would really have to do is get on a different sleeping schedule than her and i could totally avoid her.
646	fuck working.
646	i don't want to use my mind.
646	i think that is what i am going to work on this weekend.
646	i can go volunteer at some old person place and find a honey.
646	sounds like a plan.
646	talk to you later.
647	she lies
648	i don't think i can make it b/c we have a west desk dinner that night.
649	there was nothing but blue hairs there.
649	all the chicks were lying about their age.
649	i needed to escape that place.
649	my hair looks great today.
650	they are getting tighter.
650	my new diet seems to be working.
650	i need to drink more water so my skin will get smoother.
651	thanks.
651	i might check it out.
652	Here are the prices.
652	Let me know if you need any other points.

655	i need to do cardio after work and then eat.
655	you still up for golf sat?
655	i will get the tee time tomorrow.
656	i don't think we bet, but i will give you the benefit of the doubt.
656	since florida won that makes us even.
656	here is the math: you owe me 50 i owe you 50 florida's math dept.
656	must not have been that stellar.
656	so you and max are buying a house together?
656	that is good to hear.

656	one of my buddies from school is getting married that weekend and i might just go to that.
656	what else is new in denver?
656	you still selling drugs?
656	so who is going to be the bread winner, you or max?
656	i have been meeting some girls.
656	a lot of cougars.
656	cougars make me laugh b/c they think they are a hot commodity or something.
656	where are you and max going to buy?
656	does he still like the 5 points area?
656	that isn't exactly mayberry.
656	well practice your math and keep in touch.
657	i have a dinner to go to
658	i was having my toenails buffed, but i watched it.
658	i am heading downtown sat
659	are you in love?
659	what is his last name?
659	claven?

665	how is everything going?
665	did you have fun in denver?
665	how about the cornhuskers.
665	they seem to be getting by barely.
665	it should be interesting as they play better teams.
665	have you been golfing?
665	i haven't golfed in a long time, but i am going saturday.
665	i am also going to california next week and will golf there.
665	give me a call this weekend if you get a chance.

667	i have to work through the 26th of dec.
667	i can start vacation on the 27th.
667	i think that is the day you said you wanted to head to cancun.
667	let me know when you get a chance.
668	here is a good excuse to get out of that concert: lsu football game at 7.
668	you don't need to mention to them that we are going to tear up downtown afterwards.
668	no holds barred is the motto this weekend.
669	i have to be here on the 26th.
669	i don't think we get that day off.
669	if we do have the day off i can do whatever.
669	they guy i trade the northwest is going to be out of town, that is why i have to be here.
670	i will check the vacation schedule.
670	i don't know if i have the 26th or the 24th off.
670	i will find out today.
671	you got to make her forget that dude.
671	your money
672	we went out too late.
672	there were enormous lines to get into each place.
672	it sucked.
672	we need to get there earlier.
672	i might not be able to play tomorrow night.
673	she cannot play on the team now.
673	she coaches or something like that.
673	i don't think bryan will be at the game either.
673	lisa should be there.
674	i might be able to make it.
674	i will know tomorrow.
674	are you in town this weekend.
675	are you staying in town this weekend?
676	so are you going to get that car?
677	that is scary.

679	i should be at the game tomorrow night.
680	looks like she is going to play
681	i am in for the happy hour
682	check this out.
682	it is a beau rivage special
683	double or nothing means if i win you pay me 100 and if i lose we are flat.
683	do you remember you lost $50 to me on jan 1?
683	your math is bad.
683	our bet isn't if i win you owe me $100 and if you win i owe you $100.
683	that doesn't make sense.
683	you need to stop sniffing the glue.
683	how is the house hunting going?
683	so are you and max going 50/50?
683	i haven't met all cougars.
683	i met a little hottie who is an education major.
683	she is still in school.
683	i am going young so when i get married i wont have to turn her in as early.
683	cougars don't have a long marriage expectancy if you marry someone who wants to trade you in when you are really old for a younger model.
683	geaux tigers.
684	what is up party girl?
684	i heard you are quite the dirty dancer.
685	are you playing softball tonight?
686	what field are we on tonight?
687	i will just meet you there
688	good one
689	check this out it is pretty funny
690	do you get in on it?
691	jeff skilling was walking by when i opened it
692	why did they cancel it
693	how does this work
694	do you know who the winner is?
694	i bet you want to go out with him b/c he has a new truck & boat.
695	yeah.
695	nothing turns me on like a woman in a truck.
695	does she have rebel flag stickers on the truck and calvin peeing on a ford symbol sticker?
696	there is chinese food up here.
696	i think i am going to run down to the delivery van and free the dogs out of the back.
697	i heard you were throwing a huge halloween party.
698	i don't understand your rationale in this bet.
698	i was up $50 going into our bet, you were down $50.
698	for me to now be down $100 is a $150 swing.
698	why would i risk $150 vs. you risking $50?
698	florida's math dept.
698	is lousy.
698	when are you and max going to vegas?
698	i just got back in town from monterrey, ca.
698	it was another boondoggle for work.
698	here is a stock tip for you: pxlw.
698	check it out.
698	also ene.
698	very strong long term.
699	we need to figure out something to do for halloween on sat night.
700	he is going to get hurt.
700	your forgot that the saints are cursed.
701	it is a 2:30 game.
701	if we win i am at fred's right after.
701	fuck eating.
702	what time the game tomorrow?
703	we need you back for softball.
703	we need a catcher.
704	texas did go to a bowl last year and get run by an arkansas team (sec) that was blanked 35-0 in their last regular season game against lsu.
704	big 12 can say they are up this year, but the fact is there are only two teams playing football in that conference, ou/nu.
704	the other teams in the big 12 attribute their loses to a competitive conference from top to bottom.
704	i think they should change the name of the conference to the big 2.
704	at least the sec is full of good teams.
704	"the big 12 - you can't shine shit!"
705	are we hitting sierra tomorrow?
706	we do need a rivalry.
706	we can get a new rivalry and write a fight song about that team.
706	that will take us over the top.
707	i have no plans for halloween.
707	what are you going to do?

754	i suck at softball and i hate playing it.
754	i have a ' team building' thing at the rockets game.
755	Mr. Skilling- Here are a few questions I would like to submit before your floor meeting on the 32nd floor Wednesday.
755	1.) Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets.
755	Is Enron going to be just a trading company?
755	2.) If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile.
755	How could this affect our stock price?
755	Will Wall Street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings?
755	3.) Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place.
755	Is this going to have a negative effect on Enron's stock price?
755	4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near future?
755	5.) Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband?
755	I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.
755	Sincerely, Matt Lenhart

817	i just said i like rohan better than booty.
817	you guys partying this weekend?
818	that is the saddest response i have heard.
818	teachers should be continually tested.
818	i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their incompetence.
818	you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your job and half way competent.
818	democrats are so lazy.

818	al gore makes me sick.

823	thanks for your help.
823	matt

1008	you make them.
1008	i just don't think they will win the next two nat'l champ.
1009	i mean big 12.
1009	i don't think they will win the next two nat'l championships.
1009	texas definately won't.
1010	i meant the big 12.
1010	i don't think that they will win the next two.
1011	you must be on this "best conference" kick b/c your team lost.
1011	sec had a down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.
1011	lsu beat a good georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.
1011	texas lost to a pac-10 team.
1011	i don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.
1011	i will pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that smoked you guys in dallas.
1012	lsu owns texas.
1012	did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most important collegiate tournaments?
1012	why does everyone from ut think they have such a storied program?
1012	you haven't won in decades.
1012	your current coach has proved he can't win big games.
1012	you guys will be ranked high (as you were this year), but you won't hold that ranking.
1012	texas has the easiest schedule and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.
1012	all i heard last year at this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned out.
1012	you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou.
1012	good luck.
1013	i am going to go out.
1013	give me a call at home or on my cell.
1014	we couldn't get in. the line wasn't moving so we went to the hub.

1105	830 isn't too late for me.
1105	i will be there with bells on.
1105	when you become an adult, as i am, sometimes you get a little more tired.

1109	what are you doing this weekend?

1110	i had to throw a football reference in there.
1110	my bad, 830 is a lot earlier than 9.
1110	i think it is still dark at that hour.

1118	there is no question about your birthday and the superbowl unless denver plays.
1118	i went to a buddy's house to watch the game and left at halftime b/c i had no interest in the game.
1118	your favorite band was on at halftime.

1118	so why don't you come over this week and watch 9 1/2 weeks.
1119	damn baby chill!

1119	you will see.
1119	so why don't you come over tomorrow.
1119	but don't come too late b/c i can't stay up that long.
1119	did you cry tears of joy when nsync was on?
1119	i couldn't have made it in that band b/c i am too rugged.
1119	those guys are little sallys.
1120	how can you call those nerds beautiful.
1120	the guy with the beard and the one with the dreadlocks are eye sores.
1120	and those litte mos aren't more rugged than me.
1120	i could kick all their asses.
1120	anyway, why don't you come over between 7 and 8.
1120	that will give me time to work out for the 8th time of the day tomorrow.
1121	i owe you some money huh.
1121	i forgot.
1121	just send me you address again and i will mail the check tomorrow.

1412	i would rather go some place that is loud and fun like el tiempo.
1412	is there a place like that around?
1413	pretty good.
1413	i went to a broker dinner on fri and we ran a mean tab b/c of the wine.

1414	i haven't opened it.
1414	i didn't show anyone.
1415	i want to get some ritas.

1416	you never said how dinner was last night.
1417	what did you do this weekend?
1418	you didn't think it was funny.

1435	sounds good.
1436	just break your necks when i walk by to the bathroom or something.
1436	i probably won't be able to keep her off of me after that.
1437	give me a call when you get a chance.
1437	i lost your number again.

1474	A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in front of his office, ready to show it off to his colleagues.
1474	As he got out, a truck passed too close and completely tore off the door on the driver's side.
1474	The trader immediately grabbed his cell phone, dialed 911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.
1474	Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions, the energy trading icon started screaming hysterically.
1474	His Mercedes, which he had just picked up the day before, was now completely ruined and would never be the same, no matter what the body shop did to it.
1474	When he finally wound down from his ranting and raving, the officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief.
1474	"I can't believe how materialistic you energy traders are," he said.
1474	"You are so focused on your possessions that you don't notice anything else."
1474	"How can you say such a thing?"
1474	asked the trader.
1474	The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is missing from the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the truck hit you."
1474	"My God!"
1474	screamed the master trader.
1474	"Where's my Rolex?"
1475	i will be out of town
1476	so who wants to send me some money for this deposit.
1476	max also left me a message that he wants to add two people to the party, does anyone know who they are?

1601	my golf game sucks but that is b/c i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago.
1601	this swing is going to take me to the next level.

1611	i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon"
1612	oh yeah.
1612	he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.
1612	what are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?

1753	Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect New Orleans Saints team.
1753	The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.
1753	He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.
1753	Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
1753	In one corner of the screen, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm.
1753	He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away "I've got to get this guy!"
1753	Haslett said to himself.
1753	"He has the perfect arm!"
1753	So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans and teaches him the great game of football, and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.
1753	The young Bosnian is "canonized" as the Great Hero of football, and when Haslett asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother.
1753	"Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl."
1753	"I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says.
1753	"You deserted us. You are not my son."
1753	"I don't think you understand, Mother!"
1753	the young man pleads.
1753	"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans."
1753	"No, let me tell you," the mother retorts.
1753	"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday, and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."
1753	The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says " ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to New Orleans."
1754	> Two buddies, Tony and Steve, are getting very drunk > at a bar > when suddenly Steve throws up all over himself.

1883	Derek- Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.
1883	This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow.
1884	we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.
1884	many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.
1884	as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.
1884	we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.
1885	did you call for me at work today?
1886	did you call me today at work
1887	how was your wedding on saturday?
1888	i can't remember if i sent these to you guys or not

1899	when is the bachelorette party?
1899	what are you guys going to do?

1904	memorial weekend = booze + golf + sluts
1905	i think miami would be more fun than cayman.
1905	cayman is really laid back.
1905	miami = hot sluts
1906	i don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said.
1906	i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not.
1906	don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it.
1906	i think miami would be a lot more fun.
1907	she called me.
1907	she keeps in touch with me.
1907	she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding.
1907	i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each.
1907	miami will rock.
1908	does miami suck?
1908	i haven't ever been there.
1908	i have been to caymans and they are awesome.
1908	it is really laid back and very expensive.
1908	either place will be fun, i just think miami will be a better night life.
1909	i just want to meet some models down there.
1909	i don't hang out at discos thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.
1909	i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis.
1910	i think i will wear a suit with a t-shirt like sonny crocket
1911	merlin can be captain castillo
1912	mini me
1913	or the peck from the movie willow
1914	are you and celeste going to br on fri or sat

2038	it depends what type you get.
2038	if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that dog.
2038	if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place.
2038	those little furry dogs act like cats.
2039	are you kidding?
2039	why would you want a chihuahua?
2039	those dogs aren't even friendly.
2039	do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog?
2040	i think they are all bark and no bite.
2040	i think they could get their asses kicked by cats.
2040	they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk.
2040	you should get a cockerspaniel.
2041	your retarded.
2041	i used to have one.
2041	they are great dogs.
2042	yeah i had one.
2042	her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded.
2042	all dogs are dumb.
2042	they are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak.
2043	look, damn it, they have all the personality in the world and they are not that big.
2043	i don't think you know what a cockerspaniel is.
2044	i think that all they do is bark and freak out.
2044	they aren't good dogs.
2044	they aren't friendly.
2044	and i am not angry.
2045	i couldnt see it b/c it was surrounded by a wooden fence.
2045	i know you didn't get a dog.
2045	unless you took one of your 2 hour breaks before lunch.
2046	did you get a lil' chihuahua?
2046	i hate those things.
2047	you did not
2048	lets bet your dinner on it right now.

2050	you didn't buy a dog.
2050	i want to see the receipt.

2051	when do i get to see this alleged dog?
2051	you probably got one of those robotic dogs.
2051	what is its name?
2052	this situation reminds me of kids with imaginary friends.
2052	what is your imaginary friend's name?
2053	stop lying
2054	i don't believe you b/c i don't think you would not have had time to get it yesterday when you said you had it

2055	i think i need to pay more than i want to.

2059	you can start by picking up the tab at capital grill.
2060	what color is your poodle
2061	now i know you are lying.
2061	yesterday the lie was about a poodle.
2061	why can't you just be honest with me?
2061	the lies and deceit hurt me erin.
2062	how many ounces does that little runt bailey weigh?
2063	i guess i do but i wouldn't be suprised either way.
2063	you can show me it this weekend.
2064	me > dog

2065	it is math.
2066	math is universal.
2066	me =/ jerk
2067	i am tired.
2067	your dog kept me up all night.
2068	i am tired b/c i kept waking up with no covers and my butt was hanging off the bed.
2068	i looked at you and you were covered up to your neck with the covers in the middle of the bed.
2068	you look like you slept well.
2069	um, i don't remember that.
2070	real sweet.
2070	you have a stone heart.
2071	sad but true.
2072	i can think of a few things

2074	probablyl gonna just kick it
2075	yeah

2078	i am too tired to type
2079	i am going to stay in. i need to find a house.
2080	she is waiting to see if she can get financing.
2081	someone should tear him a new one, but it is hard to argue any of his points
2082	b/c i wanted to read a story freak
2083	i am sure they are.
2083	houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.
2083	economy should be good here.
2084	are you leaving in 15 min or something?
2084	i think i am out of here.
2084	i need a haircut.
2085	that is all we can do is attack his mom.
2085	i am all for it.
2085	she should be ashamed of producing such a jackass.
2086	ditto
2087	i hope he doesn't publish this and respond to it today.
2088	what game
2089	you probably didn't even see it
2090	here is our bet on cu/a&m game this summer.
2090	i have cu -8.
2090	we can think of a dinner later.
2091	i don't think so.
2091	sometimes the sun shines on a dogs ass but i don't see that happening again.
2092	if you win lets go to applebys and if i win lets go to redwood grill.
2093	that is working out perfect for you
2094	times are getting tight for me.
2094	i really liked that house i saw yesterday.
2094	i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me.
2095	your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english.
2095	i was wondering why you didn't respond.
2095	jury duty sucks huh?
2095	have you been going out at all?
2096	not much.
2096	i am trying to sell my house so i have been looking for a new house recently.
2096	there are some cool things that i have found.
2096	i have been going out a little, but not like we did in the beginning of the year.
2096	that was fun.
2096	when i move i will throw a big party and we can start it up again.
2097	i am not going to do that.
2097	my job is too good here.
2097	i want to live in denver, but i want the job i have here.
2097	i can go there later.
2097	hopefully i will get paid and it will work out.
2098	i cannot make it.
2098	my parents will be in town this weekend.

2101	how does that sound?
2102	what do you mean you guess?
2103	good.
2103	that is what i like to hear.
2104	if you act enthusiastic(sp?) then you'll be enthusiastic(sp?)!
2105	you know i can't wait to see you
2106	this is a photo of the girl i think you look like but it isn't really a good pic.
2107	she isn't gross .
2107	she is hot.
2107	you need to see her on tv.
2107	like i said, that is not a great pic.
2108	where did you look her up?
2108	i dont know what you are talking about b/c she is skinny and pretty.
2109	are you sure you are looking at the correct one b/c i don't see her on yahoo.
2109	i think you are lying b/c she is not gross.
2110	i just did that and she is not in there.
2110	she does not look like a man.
2110	she is a hottie.
2111	this is the site and she doesn't look like a man.
2111	danm it.
2112	whatever.
2112	i think you are messing around and you probably love the comparisson.
2113	those photos are all stretched out.
2113	i can't believe you don't think she is pretty
2114	whatever.
2114	i try to be nice and pay you a compliment and you turn it on me.
2114	i guess i will just never compliment you again.
2115	i thought it was.
2115	i think that girl is hot.
2115	if i won $80million that is the girl i want you to hook up with.
2116	does that mean you would do it even if i didn't win $80million
2117	oh my god!
2117	i am all worked up here at work.
2117	i am going to find you a hottie right now.
2118	i am all hot and bothered.
2119	your mom didn't say she was ugly.
2119	stop lying.
2119	i think that girl is hot so i don't care.
2120	oh.
2120	that is different than your first response.
2120	quite different.
2120	i am going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks.
2121	just did.
2121	let me know what she says.
2122	tori over here thinks bonnie is a hottie.
2123	i dont think you look like her anymore.
2123	my judgement was off that day.
2123	i was around paint fumes looking at houses.
2124	do you think i am high maintanence?
2125	i just heard that before and tori was joking w/ me about that.
2125	i don't get it.
2125	are we starting our contest tonight?
2126	our going out contest.
2126	are we starting that tonight or do you concede?
2126	i don't know why she thinks i am high maintanence.
2127	don't be fucking stupid.
2127	i wouldn't do it straight up when i could get points.
2128	i don't like double standards being put on me.
2128	i am the only one that can do double standards.
2129	we will see what the line is.
2129	either you will take it or you wont.
2129	don't try to negotiate.
2130	how are we doing on our contest?
2131	i didn't even go home

2138	just chill girl.
2139	you have such a temper.
2140	it is so easy b/c you get all worked up and you are not sure whether to believe me or not.
2141	i am gonna buy you a bmw
2142	i resent that last comment
2143	i resent that too
2144	i am going to the strip club.

2169	someplace that is like $30 an entree.
2170	you can't be cheap if you take me out.
2170	i won't stand for it.

2196	i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.
2196	we watched it and then went out in the french quarter.
2196	i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows.
2196	i don't think i want to drive in for the game.
2197	i am definately staying in town.
2197	i don't feel like battling that traffic.
2198	i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time.
2198	do you want to golf sat?
2199	how was this weekend?

2201	definately.
2201	let me know.
2202	this is unbelievable.
2202	seems like the worst is yet to come.
2202	if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10.
2203	i went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.
2203	those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.

2210	i will find out who is in town.
2210	i talked to some people and they are up for it.
2210	we could watch lsu and then go to r&r.
2210	they are having a pimps and prostitute party.
2211	enron is going to be a penny stock pretty soon.
2211	sec is investigating now.
2212	i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.
2212	i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.
2212	you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.
2212	i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.
2212	i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.
2212	as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.
2212	when is this trip?
2213	i have a room reserved.
2213	it is $160/night.
2213	we can split it up and pay $40 each which is cheap.
2213	i think it is around jan 12th.
2213	i have the room from that thurs-sat.
2214	those brides maids are ready to party.
2214	this hotel is right on south beach.
2215	thanks for including me.
2215	i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.
2215	i have to go to miami and party on south beach.
2215	sorry.
2215	maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar) i could definately go.
2215	robicheaux is bald?
2215	i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.
2215	i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.
2215	i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed.
2216	i definately need to throw in some shit about that and all the stripper sluts we met in vegas.
2216	or the hooker scott hooked up with.
2216	that would make a good speech.
2217	my 401k is now worthless.
2217	i have no money.
2218	our stock is taking a bath.
2219	i like miss +10.5, iowa st, and ark
2220	yeah.
2220	i had it picked out and everything.
2220	i had to call the dealer and tell him i am not going to suprise you with it.
2220	we can still go to dinner tomorrow night though.
2221	probably not.
2221	i think you should understand my situation.
2222	you guys still going out tonight?
2223	there is a double standard here so i can't understand
2224	b/c i want you to understand when i am out of money, but if you owe me dinner and are out of money i cant understand.
2225	give me a shout later.
2225	we need to dress up and party regardless.
2226	i was going to go running after work and then maybe stop by.
2226	who all was going to go?
2227	ok.
2227	what are you guys doing for halloween?
2227	boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r.
2227	i guess there is some halloween thing there.
2227	let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later.
2228	so are we still on for dinner or what?
2229	i think we might go to the garden in the heights party or r&r for halloween.
2229	we are going to watch the game first.
2229	let me know if you hear of anything else.
2230	i am gonna get wasted at this dinner.
2231	no.
2231	it means i am excited to go.
2232	i doubt it.
2232	i want to go party afterwards and dress up for halloween.
2232	are you going as gi joe again?
2233	i think i am going to dress up as a chippendale stripper.
2233	i am going to oil myself up and go out in a thong.
2234	this is the group throwing the party at r&r sat night.
2234	check some of the photos at the link at the bottom.
2234	lots of hotties.
2235	i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it.
2235	what is xp?
2236	i heard saturday, but that looks like it is the following sat.
2236	that would work out perfect.
2236	i am ready to tear it up.
2237	i think we are now going to r&r.
2237	boone has free passes.
2238	read this article.
2238	it is a little dramatic.
2239	who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?
2239	that sounds like a george costanza.
2239	hair is important to women under 45.
2239	i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls.
2240	sorry i had to run last night.
2240	so the word is now that enron has about 4 or 5 companies looking to take us over.
2240	aol, lucent, revlon?, and a few others.
2240	i will give you a call later.
2241	i dont know but we would be the prettiest in the industry.
2242	i am interested in going to the game.
2242	i could be up for it.
2243	actually they are not looking at us.
2243	some of our lawyers defended revlon.
2243	i heard it wrong.
2244	give me a shout at work when you get a chance.

2310	what the fuck is numbers?
2310	i hate live music.
2311	i might be up for it though
2312	looks like becoming a waiter is a better possibility every day.
2313	the stock is below $10 and the company might go bankrupt.
2314	i applied at house of pies last night.
2315	what are the odds of enron making it.
2315	seems that we are in a cash crunch.
2316	i am not joking.
2316	it will just be temporary until i get back on my feet.
2317	the assets are marked up and we cant sell them.
2317	the problem is that we have tapped out our credit lines and we need another $2 billion.
2317	seems like we are racing against the clock.
2318	i know.
2318	i love working here.
2318	i wish it would just get fixed.
2318	i don't think mgmt has informed us of what is going on completely.
2319	i won't be a waiter for more than a year.
2319	it takes time.
2319	it isn't like i will change my profession to a waiter.
2319	it will just be something to pay the bills.
2319	i don't know why it is so hard for you to understand that.
2319	i haven't heard about my house.
2320	i am serious
2321	just getting applications at denny's, house of pies, appleby's and chilis

2334	daily dose on enron - we are finished.
2334	i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.
2334	the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.
2334	not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.
2334	can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.
2335	i didn't want you to go.
2335	i was just going to sleep anyway.
2335	i was too tired to give you any action.

2342	sorry i didn't call you back last night.
2342	i didn't get home until late.

2342	i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair.
2342	i will call you later.
2343	dynegy trades around their assets.
2343	they aren't big risk takers like enron.
2343	looks like the deal is now done.
2343	now we just need to wait and see what happens.
2344	this article mentions your chapter of sigma chi.
2345	game is on tv tomorrow.
2346	how did you do on your test?
2347	no.
2347	i was home before 10.
2347	definately party tonight and golf tomorrow.
2348	they inked the deal.
2348	dynegy has aquired us.
2349	sounds good.
2349	have a good time.
2349	i think i am going to stay in town and golf.
2349	we will go party some other time.
2350	tux has been ordered.
2350	speech is being considered.
2351	no problem.
2351	hull said it wouldn't be a good party anyway.
2351	you know you didn't fall asleep, it is called passing out.
2352	do you still want to go out tonight?
2353	i don't know about you guys, but i feel a lot better after reading that.
2354	now i know something will get done.
2355	of course i do.
2355	i want to see my sweet baby.
2355	how was your day off.
2355	did you buy me an xmas gift?
2356	don't be cruel
2357	maybe.
2357	why?
2358	so everyone is pretty pissed over here b/c there is a report that ken lay will get $80 million if he doesn't join the new company.
2358	he is getting a golden parachutte for ruining the company.
2359	i have fri off.
2360	people are pretty upset todya.

2363	there is a credit spread b/t ice and eol for phys transactions
2364	yeah baby.
2364	i am a limited partner.
2365	they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset.
2365	the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire.
2365	skilling and fastow bolted.
2365	i have no respect for them.
2365	i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89, but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110.
2365	not 90 down to 10.
2366	what is going on?
2366	did you end up going out on sat?
2367	r&r was fun.
2367	we went downtown first and it sucked.
2367	i felt like i was in kabul w/ all of al queda.
2367	r&r was packed though.
2367	i didn't get there until around 1am.
2367	when are you going home?
2368	i am going to stay here.
2368	i am going to the ut/a&m game on fri.

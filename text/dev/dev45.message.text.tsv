1	Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.
1	Wipe tests taken of the interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.
1	This was not a standard wipe taken of a specific area.
1	These wipes were taken over large areas to determine presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.
1	After the cleaning operation was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the separator.
1	All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.
1	I feel we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.
1	Jeff, would you pass this information on to your counterpart for PG&E?
2	Tracy, thanks for the heads up.
2	Beginning in January of 2000, provide me with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date, as things (scheduling, changeout activities etc.) tend to move dates around.
3	On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.
3	It is as follows: 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 2-10.84 drip locations The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above PG&E equipment will be approx.
3	$ 75, 000.
3	I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their C/S.
3	They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.
3	Because this piping belongs to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.
3	If the decision is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.
3	I will also need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology to be used.
3	Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes to 36". One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas compressors. In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were found at regulated levels.....
4	Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline.
4	should cleaning occur of this section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.
4	Vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning schedule accordingly.
5	Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements.
5	My question is, how does the fuel use compare with what Solar says the fuel use should be?
5	If we can get Solar to provide written guarantees and "UP" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the fuel value on the permit.
5	The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment.
5	From their eyes, this would be a strong indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some merit.
5	Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.
5	Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata?
5	Then let me know.
5	If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another tactic, but only as a last resort.
6	Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.
6	As you may remember, Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire facility near Ft.
6	Stockton.
6	Groundwater montioring activities have been ongoing since aprox.
6	1988.
6	A permit condition states that if three years of groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be terminated.
6	A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received on July 14, 1999.
6	Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).
6	Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.
6	I anticipate that we will be required to monitor and conduct housekeeping activities at the site
7	The environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our right of way and in our measuring station yard.
7	For any construction work at the PG&E station, we will need written aprpoval from PG&E.
7	I will notify the state and county of California when we do the construction work.
7	Earl, I will need to know the amount of natural gas which will be released during the blowdown of the 1850 feet of pipe, our separator and meter tubes.
7	Pg&E will be responsible for the notification of gas release for their separator and piping....
7	David Roensch
8	Presented Title V training to the Flagstaff Team.
8	The training included responsibilities, recordkeeping and semi annual reporting requirements.
8	A meeting was held with representatives of Transwestern and PG&E to discuss activities related to removing PCB's from the Topock Lateral.
8	Sampling data was reviewed and discussions were held addressing past cleaning efforts.
8	PG&E has stated by letter and verbally that natural gas volumes will be decreased weekly until PCB concentrations fall below 5 ppm.
8	Transwestern will be implementing a pipeline cleaning of the remaining 1850 of pipe between our M/S and the PG&E C/S.
8	Included in this cleaning will be decontamination of the additional filter separators and meter runs.
8	Assisted in the compilation and data gathering of the Title V compliance monitoring and annual certification reports for C/S No. 5, Thoreau.
8	The annual blanket request for the Arizona SHPO was submtted for renewal.
8	Notification letters were submitted to the state of New Mexico notifiying the agency of like for like replacements of recipricating engines at the AToka No. 1 C/S.
8	Additional notifications were submitted to the agency apprising them of engine removal activities at C/S's No. 5 and 9 which would impact emissions fees.
9	James, lets go ahead and provide her with an annual report for Puckett with the information you provided.
9	thanx again
10	Thanx John, I look forward to seeing you at the Doubletree for dinner on the night of the September 3.
10	Let me know your traveling plans
11	In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral, I have asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.
11	Mr. Woodyard has considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in industry associations (INGAA and GRI), Mr. Woodyard also works as a consultant in this capacity.
11	The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 am.
11	Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date.
11	I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and encourage all to attend, if possible.
12	Mr. Cates, sir, would you please approve of the attached expense report?
12	You are a kind and generous man.
13	NNG Gomez Plant, Site Cleanup has been completed.
13	All activities associated with the items identified during the sale of the facility have been corrected.
13	Becuse ET&S owns and WGR operates, there is a concern that WGR may not adhear to compliance and housekeeping at the facility.
13	This has been the case in the past.
13	Discussions will be held with Enron Legal to address these concerns.
13	TW Bell Lake Gas Plant, Ground Water Remediation.
13	A revised Water Development Easement from the State Land Office was received.
13	This will allow TW access to install one additional downgradient groundwater monitor well.
13	The tentative schedule to install the well will be the week of September 13th.
13	A construction permit application for installation of an SVE remediation system for the North Crawar C/S was mailed to the TNRCC.
13	The State of New Mexico conducted an air quality inspection of the Atoka No. 2 C/S.
13	No items or deficiencies were identified by the agency.
13	The Title V air permit application for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Qualtiy Bureau.
13	The Notice of Intent air permit application for the Crawford C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau.
13	Annual blanket request letters were submitted to the USFWS in New Mexico and Texas for renewal.
13	A meeting was held in Houston with John Woodyard of Roy F. Weston and ET&S mgt.
13	addressing PCB activity in natural gas pipelines as related to the PG&E PCB Topock Lateral issue.
14	The PCB Annual Document Logs for the facilities that generated PCB waste and stored it at TW's long term storage facility were completed and distributed to locations and entered into Envisions.
14	The 2rd quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB mgt.
14	committee conference call was completed.
14	This committee meets to discusss PCB management on the SoCal system and review invoices generated by SoCal during each quarter.
14	This quarters invoice amount was $280,633.48 of which Transwestern is 86% responsible or $241,344.79.
14	Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.
14	Analytical results of the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be successful.
14	All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 microgram/100 cm.
14	sq. Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less than 20 ppb.
14	The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher facilities installed at the mainline interconnect.
15	With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia concerning pipeline integrity and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline Company offers the following response: Pipeline Integrity.
15	With the construction of the evaporation ponds over Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored the potential for impacts for the pipeline.
15	This includes a more frequent inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking potentiometric readings to verify that corrosion is not present.
15	Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the potential of pipeline corrosion.
15	As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the evaporation ponds.
15	The pipline safety measures implemented by Transwestern are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system at the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also allow for long term stability and integrity by conducting state of the art monitoring and detection.
15	Noise Issue.
15	In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.
15	This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso Station.
15	Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above those levels mandated by FERC.
15	In the event of operational noise levels exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to performing any and all mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.
15	Decrepancy of trailer park residents.
15	In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the adjacent trailer park was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, but "more like 35 trailers".
15	The number of mobile home residences currrently in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.
15	Transwestern's trailer park residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.
15	The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature of the residences.
15	It should also be noted that during the time that the trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the operation of the ponds and raw sewage had overflowed the pond embankments and had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the trailer park residents.
15	It was actually noted that many of the spaces normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.
15	This unsanitary condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.
15	The NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.
16	Kay, the choice is yours as to how you want to clean your oil staining.
16	both technologies will work.
16	I prefer the quicker of the two......in the interest of time ie steam
17	Rich, whats your thoughts on a decent pipeline segment for the modeling study.
17	I kind of like Sta.
17	4 to Sta.
17	3.
17	It encompasses alot of the variablity present on the Transwestern system (elevation, temperature, consistent activities with respect to the rest of the PCB contaminated system).
17	Let me know before the Penn State visit, so I can start rounding up the analytical data for the pipeline and stations.....
18	Butch, you may want to attend this
19	Bret, what do you think about this?
19	We have pretty much proven that we are not the culprits is this activity.
19	I have a problem conducting an ongoing sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated the sampling activity.
19	I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the data points to our neighbors.
19	Additionally, because of the turnover and inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.
19	Thoughts....
19	George Robinson
20	George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.
20	the soonest I can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.
20	I have reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and the evidence weighs in our favor.
20	At your leisure and prior to the November OCD meeting, prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and why Texaco is.
20	Gradients, plume elevations and characteristics of the contaminants show that this is not our problem.
20	Id like to have sufficient evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and get us out of this issue.
20	I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is responsible) reimburse Northern for the costs we have incurred for what is Texaco's problem.
20	George Robinson
21	George, I will attend this meeting with you on the 16th.
21	George Robinson
22	Mike, I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as what was provided to him in the way of data and history.
22	His proposed scope seems to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.
22	I have included Louie in the distribution and am sure he will have some input.
22	My comments are as follows: 1.
22	I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at this time.
22	As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and I think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot SoCal.
22	Both parties in the past, have been helpful and very cooperative in matters pertaining to PCB's.
22	Because the modeling study will be conducted between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on this.
22	2.
22	Also, I would like to see if we can deal with PCB's and arsenic at the same time?
22	Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?
22	3.
22	Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?
22	In leau of the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section to be modeled, will the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?
22	4.
22	I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional PCB's into the SoCal system.
22	Its been pretty quiet in discussions with the SoCal PCB person.
22	I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the alert when we start the cleaning?
22	Louie, thoughts?
22	5.
22	Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.
22	How will we do this and how do we get it out?
22	6.
22	Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.
23	Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and all went well.
23	Prior to the state visit, we went through a "trouble shooting" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate permitting information for that altitude and temperature.
23	Solar was very helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the facility.
23	I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more emissions.
23	Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.
23	Because we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued within the next couple of months.....
23	bottom line is that no NOV will be issued for the fuel use issue.
23	William Kendrick
24	This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.
24	David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the model will yeild some useful information.
24	Adewumi was asked about the simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can address this situation.
24	He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.
24	As is the case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be addressed until we begin the process.
24	It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact Michael Adewumi.
24	David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.
24	It may also be in the best interest of this project to see a team of technical and operational experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.
24	By working through the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns and increase the cleaning success.
24	Although Transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data results, the system has met with variable success.
24	The more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be the modeling conclusions and results of the cleaning activity.
25	A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the facility.
25	The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee environmental issues on pueblo lands.
25	The meeting centered around three issues: a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at the site.
25	Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why these issues were unresolved in the "eyes" of the Laguna.
25	Transwestern committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.
25	With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants (chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its remediation efforts.
25	Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.
25	At the conclusion of the meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.
25	The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.
25	The Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.
25	The Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental compliance on the Laguna pueblo.
26	Jim, yes you will need a USGS
27	I think its time that we did a maintenace spot check on the White units at the above referenced facility, to stay in line with the operating conditions of the facility permit.
27	It would probably be a good idea to check on the emissions status of the Whites at the same time.
28	The state of Texas conducted an air quality inspection of the NNG Seminole C/S.
28	There were no deficiencies or violations identified at the facilit during the inspection.
28	The State of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the Transwestern Atoka No. 3 C/S.
28	The Agency conducted a record review and did portable emissions testing of 3 of the 5 emissions units at the facility.
28	Although fuel use and a natural gas analysis were not available for the units tested, emissions exceedances for NOx are expected for the 2 White Superiors at the facility.
28	The State of New Mexico Air Quality Buureau conducted an inspection of the Transwestern Atoka No. 2 C/S.
28	The agency conducted a portable emissions testing of the two turbines and one recip at the facility.
28	Although fuel use and a natural gas analysis was not available at the facility, all units tested appeared to be in compliance with the permit limits.
28	The agency requested sulfur readings from the fuel gas as required under Subpart GG NSPS for the last twelve months.
28	The Artesia team has contacted Gas Control in Houston for the for the monthly sulfur values at the facility.
29	Leo, my computer has fouled up and I wasnt sure you got this so Im sending it again.....
30	Rick, its that time of year again, do your magic and approve the attached expense report And thanx again for the Topock consideration, I do appreciate it.....
31	For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those turbines which have undergone power unit changouts, the following recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply: 1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas which supplies the applicable turbine(s).
31	2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for nitrogen and delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be used for sulfur.
31	These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and Sundays.
31	3) The measurement must be taken at the location.
31	An exception to this is that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or downstream of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase the measurements for the applicable turbine fuel gas.
31	4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent for the nitrogen and sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule (CFMS) from the EPA.
31	Approval of a CFMS allows a greatly reduced recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.
31	CFMS requests have been submitted for the following facilities: Plains Turbine C/S Monument C/S Crawford C/S Bloomfield C/S Approvals have not as yet been obtained.
31	Until issuance of a CFMS, an applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and sulfur.
31	Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include: Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might be required for each CFMS.
31	I would strongly advise that the La Plata and Panhandle teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so that the deadlines and reportings are not missed.
31	If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact Butch or myself.
32	The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico.
32	A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.
32	Due to the agenciy's portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.
32	Also discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other miscellaneous air issues.
32	Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.
32	An Enron contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the results of the investigation.
32	The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules.
32	Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.
32	A phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed.
32	Pending additional lack of response, a meeting will be requested to the agency requesting action and approval of the requests.
32	Data requests from Argent Consulting have been distributed to the field for the 1999 emissions inventories.
32	Results of the additional archeological and biological survey's for the Gallup C/S power transmission line 7C application have been submitted to regualtory affairs in Omaha.
32	There were no positive concerns or impacts identified which would require additoinal actions.
33	Bret, per ;you request, presented below is a list of Priority 1 and 2 sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Texas for which we have running horsepower and emit emissions to the atmosphere.

34	Louie, I dont have any plans for a trip to HOuston, except for the Mage tech mtg during the last week in Feb. 28, 29, March 1 ,2 Louis Soldano
35	A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.
35	The history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed.
35	A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming requirements under Title III.
35	A request will be sent out ot the field for each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and rich lean glycol samples.
35	Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its fate.
35	Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill.
35	The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via conference call.
35	Invoices and charges were discussed which So cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system.
35	At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61.
35	Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress.
35	A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.
35	While fabrication is in progress for the correct chamber, temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.
35	Even though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.
35	The correct chambers will be available and installed sometime next week.
36	Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB issue with PG&E.
36	Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution areas.
36	With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations (N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock and Hinckley C/S.
36	The good news is that PCB's have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx.
36	160 miles from the Topock C/S.
36	PG&E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers.
36	the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6/1/00.
36	Now for the bad news.
36	At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.
36	This includes all piping and equipment.
36	I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful.
36	The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug.
36	They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system.
36	Additionally, the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations.
36	Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned.
36	Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx.
36	3-5 million.
36	I think that this is only the "tip of the iceberg".
36	If they are successful with this action, the pipeline system will be next.
36	Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. Ill keep you informed on this,,,,,,,
37	Michael, our liquids data collections have been pretty lean.
37	Its only been in the last couple of months where we have actually collected any arsenic data.
37	I will send to you what data have have with respect to arsenic, including some historic reserch in the Abo field of southeast New Mexico where the arsenic is generated from down hole.
37	The source is not so much from what is coming out of the wells (catalyst towers were installed in the late 80's to trap the arsenic) as the residual which has collected in the pipeline prior to the installation of the catalyst towers.......
38	As a reminder, the state of Texas requires releases of natural gas greater than 119 mscf to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the Regional Offices of the TNRCC.
38	These releases include but may not be limited to the following: ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and maintenance activities.
38	Should any of the above activities release natural gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the Regional Office of the TNRCC within the following timeframes: Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset.
38	Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance.
38	This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the TNRCC, they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 mscf.
38	The agency's inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns.
38	It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the TNRCC's position regarding this issue.
38	However, until a position has been adopted by Enron's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and report as appropriate.
38	The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows: Midland (915) 570-4795 Included facilities- Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole Lubbock (806) 796-7107 Included facilities- P-2, Plainview, Brownfield San Angelo (915) 658-5431 Included facilities- Reagan Co. 2, Irion Co. 1, Reporting forms for the release can be faxed to your location by request by contacting me at (505) 625-8022.
39	Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.
39	They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E system.
39	From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by them which Louie has a copy of.
39	The statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect.
39	Louie and I are planning to attend this meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.
39	The results of this meeting will be forwarded at a later date.....
40	Steve, you have been given all the written permit history and portable analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the State of New Mexico.
40	All of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously.
40	If there is confusion, I apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the State of New Mexico has been made available for review and use.
40	If I need to sit down with you and or others to go over this, let me know.
40	Steve SanMiguel
41	No. thank you
42	Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San Francisco.
42	He thought that one day would be more that adequate.
42	I need to have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.
42	Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end with our legal contacting their legal?
42	Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was the following: PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the gas.
42	Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry of the unknown) Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage their PCBs Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred Michel Nelson
43	A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S.
43	The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.
43	A permit revision was requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit replacements without agency notification.
43	Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.
43	Analytical shows that the PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.
43	Ralph Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning SoCal's experience with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting in San Francisco.
43	The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion and submitted to M. Nelson for signature.
44	Michael, we may have to petition the teams for theri analytical
45	Rich, this is the public notice for the groundwater remediation at the TW North Crawar facility.
45	Because we are emitting emissions to the air from the contamination in the groundwater, we had to have a permit.....
46	Larry, as per our conversation, presented below are the emissions factors provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit TSP 14.000/MMSCF NOx 0.100/MMBTU CO 0.121/MMBTU VOC 0.0348/MMBTU Formaldehyde 0.00438/MMBTU As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions calculations completed for both turbines at the facility.
47	George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.
47	I dont want to send a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our own hands without involvement from the tribe.
47	If there is a reason to expidite the covering of this open area, then lets send another letter requesting to do so.
47	Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental activities.
47	I want to maintain a good working relationship with these people.
47	As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect of not keeping them in the loop previously.
47	Lets not open that type of issue again......
47	George Robinson
48	will do....
49	Thanx George for the update.
49	Norm would you mind visiting with Ms. Bernacik and explaining to her the difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were removed and the landfarm area?
49	If need be we can write her another letter requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks.
49	George Robinson
50	Received the "permit by rule" approval for the turbine power unit changeout for the Keystone C/S.
50	The emissions testing results for the Plains Turbine Station was submitted to the TNRCC.
50	Discharge renewal applications for C/S No. 9 and Monument Turbine C/S were submitted to the OCD.
50	Notification to the New Mexico AQB was given for the power turbine changeout at the Atoka No. 2 C/S.
50	One employee was skill verified for level II environmental During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that approx.
50	3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E C/S yard.
50	A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S .
50	This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter separator was installed and put inot service.
51	The Title V air permit for C/S No. 4 has been issued.
51	There are some requirements and conditions under this permit that the team should be aware of and will be required to comply with.
51	I would like to visit with the team at their safety meeting in June or july to go over the conditions of the permit.
51	Please give the the dates in June and July when your next safety meeting is.
51	This Title V presentation should last about 3 hours.
52	During the quarterly conference call with SoCal in which we discuss PCB costs on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.
52	As a result of the PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.
52	Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow, came back at 77 ppm.
52	Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following: Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered Data collected in 1998 showed that approx.
52	8% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Data collected in 1999 showed that approx.
52	9% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.
52	I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been collected.
52	We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased flows from TW into SoCal.
52	Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions resulting from the recent "hits".
52	He just indicated that they would be watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.
53	Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.
53	It appears that the BLM will implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed sensitive by the BLM.
53	The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).
53	There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.
53	A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur concentrations in the natural gas.
53	A request was made to the company to determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.
53	The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.
53	Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx.
53	$79,000.
53	Due to the press release by PG&E concerning the increased occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.
53	Preliminary sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a hit of 77 ppm was discovered.
53	As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a conference call was held the ET&S VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.
53	A meeting has been scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities will be conducted at the site.
54	A meeting was held in Laughlin, Nv with PG&E to discuss the liquids which were received and analytical result of 505 ppm which occurred at the PG&E F/S.
54	Additional discussions centered around the latest migration of PCB's into the PG&E system and control technologies to stop additional migration of PCB's into PCB free portions of their distribution system.
54	Annual emission fees were paid to the ADEQ for C/S No. 1, Kingman in the amount of $31,145.26 Annual hazardous waste fees were paid to the DTSC for the facilities that operate in the state California A meeting was held in Albuquerque to discuss and apprise involved parties of histoirc and proposed activities for 2000 for the 10 groundwater remediation projects currently being conducted in Texas and New Mexico.
54	Received a call from the TNRCC about an air quality inspection at the Irion Co. No. 1 C/S on 6/30.
54	the team was notified and preparations are currently being completed to ensure that all recordkeeping, permits and monitoring reports are onsite during the inspection.
55	Leo, for my weekly report please use the following: Provided environmental oversight and sampling for the cleaning and decontamination of the filter separator at the PG&E C/S.
55	Assisted the San Juan team in preparing for the forthcoming consolidated audit in July.
55	Witnessed the post noise surveys for the Gallup and Bloomfield C/S's which were FERC requirements under the 7C certificate for construction.

56	As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water mixture).
56	Diesel was not used in the deconning process.
56	The only equipment cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.
56	Transwestern's filters in its separator were replaced, but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.
56	The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.
56	The following samples were collected during this project: On the Transwestern side: 1.
56	Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters were removed.
56	Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of PCB's.
56	(Not 100 sq. cm. sample) 2.
56	A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the Selexol Plant.
56	The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 3.
56	Composite sample of the fine powdery rust which had collected in the bottom of the F/S.
56	Approximte volume one cup.
56	4.
56	Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S.
56	Visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and virtually unstained.
56	A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S.
56	5.
56	A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.
56	This was a control sample.
56	On the PG&E side: 1.
56	A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter separator prior to deconning.
56	Approx.
56	volume one cup 2.
56	Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the F/S.
56	An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S prior to deconning was approximately one gallon.
56	3.
56	Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 cm sq. wipe) 4.
56	Used filter media from the F/S.
56	The operation of the F/S filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.
56	Composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.
56	5.
56	Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls.
56	The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present in Transwestern's F/S .
56	As previously mentioned, samples were collected of both materials.
56	The only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume.
56	It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.
56	The small amount of rust materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.
56	I will have reprensentataive samples of both materials.
56	Photographs were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with on the 13th of July.
56	Analytical results will also be completed at this time.
57	Thanx.
57	Very professionally written.

66	WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?
67	When we do the emissions testing at C/S No. 3, Luepp, we should be aware of the positives and negatives.
67	The positives being the information which Steve and company will collect.
67	This appears to be a very useful tool.
67	There is also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this facility.
67	There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly lower than what was placed into the permit application.
67	The downside to this effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the difference (1996 to the present).
67	Additionally, enforcement action could result by the Navajos.
67	I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and negative potentials involved in completing this study.
67	From the emission estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they exist.
67	And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually emit.
67	These units have never been tested.
67	This uncertanty in itself may be the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago.

81	I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.
81	Ralph said that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in the past couple of years (97-2000).
81	I shared with Ralph and up until this year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.
81	He stated that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).
81	He said that their data shows the following: 1998 liquids concentrations only 1% regulated at the federal level 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a liquids sample at the Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with the collection.
81	I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.

85	Can you help Sherry with this set-up.
86	Looks familiar?
87	I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the fuel mixers with carbuerators at the Spraberry Plant.
87	It seems that this replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.
87	According to the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.
87	To do this they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their approval.
87	IE before and after testing.
87	I am going to request that we be allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing in a third party referenced testing company.
87	Contractor testing runs about A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the agency.
87	In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one unit to be tested but not on all units.
87	Should testing show other exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger actions requiring perimtting.
87	Under the circumstances, I think it would be in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, we comply immediately.
87	I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.
87	If approved, we should test ASAP.
87	Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.
87	Let me know if the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.
88	A phase I due diligence was completed for EOTT on two liquids pipeline segments in the Texas Panhandle and in Northwestern Colorado.
88	The assets are owned by Equilon Pipeline Company.
88	A copy of the findings have been submitted to Legal.
88	There were some deficiencies and potential liabilities discovered as a result of this activity.
88	Assisted the Roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 6 month and 12 Title V certification reports for the Roswell C/S.
88	No deficiencies or non compliance issues were identified for this 12 month period.
88	Annual certification reports were submitted to the TNRCC for 3 Transwestern and 8 Northern Natural Gas C/S in west Texas.
88	There wer no deficiencies or non compliance issues identified for any of the 11 facilities during this 12 month period.
88	The TNRCC reviewed the emissions testing report for the NNG Plains C/S and requested modification to the original report submitted.
88	The testing contractor was contacted and a revised report was submitted to the agency.
89	I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.
89	I will send out the letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.
89	I would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed ASAP.
89	Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on.
89	Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that we follow a portocol that I will submit to the state.

121	Her number is 713.345.3461
122	This is a message from Kerry.
122	I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.
122	He uses ESIS.
122	I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected (logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.
122	I received a message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was "Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.
122	Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW Thanks, Kerry
123	SORRY.
123	WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
124	Have you deposited the wedding check?
124	I'm trying to balance my checkbook.
125	Have you decided what time is good?
126	I'm free all day.
126	Give me a time.
127	I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at C/S 2 Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period for agency review and approval.
127	Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter.
127	On Monday, the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the C/S.
127	After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which will not impact or change a combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a change in design.
127	After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without any notification to the agency.
127	The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical activity, which would cost more than 25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, that we provide them a courtesy notification.
127	I told them we would apprise them of such an activity.....
128	Lorraine, I dont have a problem with continuation of this sampling, but we better hear from our conservative tight fisted attorney first....
129	9214 Sanford send the failure to deliver message you got to my it contact.
130	call me at home
131	I would be honored.
131	Do we meet there or somewhere else?
132	yes.
132	let me know.
133	what's the final plan.
133	where?
133	when?
133	where do we meet?
134	don't worry about the margin call.
134	it's taken care of.
135	what are you guys doing for new year's?
135	work 713.853.9351 home 713.777.0146 pager 800.963.0942
136	both.
136	you have to schd.
136	all your trades.
137	Bill, Just a short note to let you know whats going on at Bakersfield.
137	I have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the NOV issues and have been told that EOTT will definately receive a an NOV and fine for failure to conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been tested approx.
137	6 months ago.
137	With repsect to the other NOV issue, Rick Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today.
137	As the testing contractor began his testing, an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to Rick.
137	As a result, the the inspector observed elevated CO readings from the heater that Rick had made adjustments in the heater set points (based upon recommendations from the contractor) causing the elevated CO readings to result.
137	The inspector stated that the facility would receive another NOV for this exceedance.
137	In any event this isssue was NOT Rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the contractor.
137	We have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in another testing company (AEROS) on thursday.
137	This is the contractor who has done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first testing company's data.
137	With this new data, we shold be able to demonstrate inaccuracy in the first testing company's QA/QC.
137	It should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental issues which we should discuss at your convenience.
137	Butch and I will have completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for discussions on friday.
137	William Kendrick
138	I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.
138	On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith (advisor for the Laguna team), myself) and George Robinson.
138	This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo.
138	The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.
138	With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review.
138	With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.
138	The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.
138	They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results (Im using their words).
138	They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.
138	Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP, expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands.
138	One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer" with potential to spread.
138	A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells..
138	A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site).
138	Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them.
138	It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting.
138	He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..
138	He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done.
138	At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's internal remediation group would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions.
138	This seemed to satisify the POEP and they were content with this.
138	John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue.
138	A couple of things I want to bring out.
138	First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future.
138	Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem.
138	Although we are considered by the POEP as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with (direct quote from the POEP) they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from Transwestern to clean up the PCBs.
138	Please get back with me on this.
139	This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at the Spraberry C/S has been submitted to t he TNRCC.
139	The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit.
139	According to the agency, this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will be a plus for the company.
139	My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make this happen.
139	I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.
140	Rick, Terry had informed me that Solar had trouble with this unit in making its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.
140	I was not aware of this when I permitted the unit.a couple of years ago.
140	In an attempt to solve the problem, in November, I had submitted a modification to the permit to the state of Colorado requesting additional emissions as it appears the unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.
140	I received a call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of more emissions for us.
140	We reached an agreement with the state that they would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions. However, after Terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits. I dont know if Solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons calculations, the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that Solar promised. We have notified the state of Colorado, as the permit requires and Im sure they will be following up on this. Let me know what Solar says.......

143	Ed the 6" project you are talking about is a small project independant of Rogas where a 6"line will be constructed from North Coles and run above ground, if possible, to a tie in approx.
143	1 mile away.
143	We will need a waiver for this.
143	There wont be any by pass crossing concerns and only ocal notifications due to the efforts to run the pipe above ground.
143	The reason for constructing above ground is to minimize surface disturbance.
143	Im sure that one of the conditions of the approval for this construction actiivty is that EOTT wil be required to maintain integrity of the pipeline to ensure no releases.....inspections, reporting etc....
143	Ill keep you in the loop on this.....
144	John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 application was reviewed.
144	This may be the annual report that were talking about.
144	As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year.
144	It was not been submitted for 1999 or 2000.
144	Because Randi has been personally involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then we would submit.
144	If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been involved since the get go and she has the information.
144	She has also promised the reports to me by 2/15 for sumibttal to the F&G.
144	John Shafer
145	nope.
145	what's the occasion?
146	John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the 7 mile pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental permitting and approvals.
146	The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies: California fish and game 1603 application Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification Reclamation Board- encroachment application Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances for this project.
146	I would suspect that they would want us to do a field survey prior to construction.
146	It seems that every Califonia state and county agency is a candidate for notification or approval.
146	Ill keep you apprised......
147	John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az.
147	where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.
147	With this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).
147	We will use the same gas quality for each location.
147	I have a meeting with the agency on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date.
147	If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your assistance in this also.

148	John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.
148	During the EPA Title V inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna environmental person was present.
148	She had been asked to be there by the EPA.
148	During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.
148	I had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision.
148	I would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.
149	Bill, the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.
149	I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two C/S on state lands.
149	Ive dealt with these individuals before, but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that.
149	After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.
149	I have calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands.
149	Pending the outcome of each meeting, I will decide who to use.
149	Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.
149	I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona.
149	One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project.
149	He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks.
149	Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an overall major emissions decrease.
149	After the six month period, the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.
149	Also, my intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system.
149	If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, this should be easy to do.
149	The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can do, but has had trouble reaching.
149	One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.
149	By permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.
149	Ill share the emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units.
149	I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report.
149	Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 report will be completed by March 1.
149	Is there something Ive missed?
150	This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.
150	Construction activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, buildings, electrical poles etc. The state and federal agencies take a very dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to approval.
150	This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing construction of the proposed activity.
150	Your assistance in this compliance issue will be greatly apprecaited.
150	Data generation and agency consultations are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.
150	Should you need further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.
151	Thanx, George.
151	Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation is of the conditions at Sta.
151	6.
151	Im interested in what their thoughts are with respect to the remediation of the sandstone fractures and movement of condensate with PCB's..
151	George Robinson
152	Rich, thanx for the sampling update.
152	Ill pass it along to the apropriate parties.
152	A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down, as expected, with no glaring increases.
152	Anything urgent we need to discuss?
153	I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this tuesday.
153	I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB quarterly management conference call that Transwestern has with SoCal to discuss PCB related invoices.
153	As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe) in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.
153	He wil also be providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.
153	I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.
153	I had asked him to only focus on the Southwest system.
153	Apparently Southwest is not up to speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an LDC standpoint.
153	I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the PCB regulations.
153	Ralph said he will let me know the results of the meeting.
154	go to page D-6 for the capital loss carryover worksheet.
155	Mr. Stewart, as per you voice mail request to me on Feb. 20, 2001, attached is the correspondance concerning the reqeust to replace the mixing valves with carbuerators at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.
155	The players in this activity included Jon Fields of Argent Consulting.
155	Due to the fact that the pre testing data for the emissions from the mixing valves and the post testing data for emissions from the carbuerators were received in hard copy only, I am not able to provide this as an attachment.
155	This data was, however, sent to you via fed-x on January 24, 2001.
155	If needed, I can resubmit the results of the data for your review.
155	As expected, the emissions levels did decrease when the carbs were installed.
155	Please reveiw the attached correspondance concerning the request to replace the mixing valves at the Spraberry Plant (TNRCC account No. ML-0022-W) with carbuerators without requiring involvement of a permitting activity.
155	Thank you for your consideration in this issue.
156	Mr. Stewart, as per your voice mail request on Feb. 20, 2001, attached find the correspondance relating to the request of replacing the existing mixing valves with carburetors at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.
156	In this discussion, Jon Fields of Argent Consulting was involved.
156	I have attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.
156	The results of the pre testing emissions with the mixing valves on and the post testing of the emissions with the carburetors on were mailed to you on Jan. 20, 2001.
156	The testing results were compiled in hard copy form and are not included with this submittal, but can be resubmitted if requested.
156	Your favorable request in this replacement activity is requested.
157	Arnold, I think I will pass on the meeting.
157	Please apprise me of anything I may need to know from the meeting.
157	To bring you up to date on the environmental events of the turbine approvals in Arizona, I received the rough draft of the baseline noise survey and you were copied.
157	As discussed, we should address changes to the documents as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of what we would like to do or not do.
157	I was contacted by the Navajo Nation and they have requested that we do onsite surveys at the C/S on the reservation (C/S 3 and 4) for T&E plants and animals and archeology.
157	I have contacted a contractor and they will be on site to do the surveys at both stations.
157	I am planning on having the entire C/S facility surveyed at both locations as there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the construction and ground disturbance which will take place.
157	In the event there might be changes after the survey is completed, surveying the entire facility will keep us from having the new distrubance areas surveyed after the original survey was completed.
157	The F-1 environmental document for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday.
157	The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.
157	I have a meeting with EPA in San Francisco to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation on 3/20.
157	Im going to try and move this meeting up if possible.
157	After the meeting, I should be able to have an application in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a week.
157	Based upon experience with the state of Arizona, EPA and the Navajo Nation, expect permit approval within 5-7 months after submittal of the application.
158	I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site.
158	Be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta.
158	3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at sta.
158	4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.
158	Please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist.
158	The survey should only last 3-4 hours.
158	Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation said that under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report.
158	She didnt think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back logs, and personnel, it might.
158	Ill keep the pressure on.
158	The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might require.
158	Birds of a feather...
158	Ill be persistent here also.......and let you know when I find out something..........
159	Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta.
159	1-4.
159	Understand these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to emit.
159	When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA approved document.
159	This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net more emissions, if needed.
159	Emissions are presented for a single engine only in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility except Sta.
159	1 where they only have one auxillary unit.
159	NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 NOx 35.35 CO 30.40 VOC .04 NOx 43.46 CO 37.38 VOC .05
160	Terry, the entire facility has not been disturbed.
160	Only most of it.
160	Id say approx 70%.
160	The other 30% has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation, just foot and vehicle traffic.
160	I dont have problem with saying the above, but keep in mind, the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed, doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine.
160	It has always been Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations, especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value (scenery wildlife etc).
160	I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 for vegetation and soils.
160	I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats.
160	In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would not be an issue of habitat loss.
160	There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.
160	Again, TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose.
160	In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater.
160	We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking well source.
160	In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground.
160	I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe.
160	If we need to discuss the above, give me a call
161	I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal surveys at the two C/S on reservation lands.
161	I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S sites for review.
161	Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.
161	However, because of the issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.
161	John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation.
161	I have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys next week in the unlikely event a survey is required.
162	I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting about PBCs on the SWG system.
162	As mentioned in the last note, SWG has discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into their system.
162	SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and independent interconnects.
162	Liquids have been collected at the two interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm, respectively.
162	They have taken approx.
162	100 wipe samples and have had "hits" but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.
162	In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.
162	They felt that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of PCBs into their system.
162	Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two interconnect locations.
162	I gave Ralph Earl Chanleys phone number as he was involved in the separator construction project last summer with PG&E.
163	Maria, as per your request, please see the attached data: All the below figures were calculated using the 4500 hp factor on the mainline ( TCV-12 Clark ) units the mainline units.
163	Unit 621 is the auxillary engine and runs back up power, if needed.
163	The year 1997 was figured by Kerry Welch who no longer is with us.
163	1998, 1999, and 2000 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst.
163	The total throughput on condensate has been ( 0 gallons ) for 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.
163	This is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed in 1997 to a more dry natural gas and therefore, there was no liquids associated with the gas.
163	Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data.
163	We have had employee turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the information to the EPA.
163	We are in the process of standardizing our data collections to eleminate this problem in the future.
163	I hope this information will help in the permit review process.
163	Again please accept my apologizes in the data collection errors.
164	Thanx John, for the attachment.
164	How did the presentation go?
165	John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in Arizona.
165	The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.
165	Each contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them submitted to their mgt.
165	for review in a couple of days and then issued to The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 2 on Monday.
165	The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.
165	Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.
165	The original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.
165	This was definatley a plus.
165	Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.
165	GE or Rolls Royce.
165	Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary power will be installed at each location (wind, natural gas, diesel).
166	I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at stations 1 and 2.
166	Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed impact, even though part of the discovery is within the facility fence.
166	The report recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor and ensure that the site is not impacted.
166	They will also recommend that we fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline activities will not disrupt the site.
166	I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.
166	One report for each station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the entire 40 acres at each compressor station.
166	All four reports will be submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.

168	The Title V air permit applications for C/S's 3 and 4 were submitted to Region IX EPA in San Francisco.
168	These were the last two applications to be filed for the Redrock Mainline Exspansion project in Arizona.
168	Assistance was given to all field teams in Arizona in the preparation and submittal of the required annual complaince certifications required under each facilities Title V Operating Permit.
168	2000 emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the eleven C/S in the Midland Region.
168	A revised APEN was submitted to the state of Colorado for the forthcoming power turbine unit replacement to be conducted at the LaPlata C/S.

171	Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.
171	You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.
171	This letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.
171	Id like to send this out on Friday or Monday.
172	David, nice touch with the NC.
172	I sure John will have some ideas on how to best to get this thing going after the NC gets back with you.
172	Ill leave it up to Mr. Shafer as to his preference to have dinner with Mr. Smith during our June tour of the C/S facilities.
172	Good to hear that the team has bought in on supporting the NC by participation.
172	If you want me to, I can put on a little presentation to the other 2 teams in Arizona and see if we can get their support and participation also.
172	Let me know and we can do this at one of their safety meetings.......
172	David Roensch
173	Kermit Team, I received a letter from the TNRCC concerning emissions fees that have not been paid for a facility called the "Hendrick/Wink Tank Farm".
173	The letter was addressed to a Mr. Paul Newman of EOTT.
173	The letter stated that we may owe emissions fees for the facility.
173	My question is, do you have such a facility in your team area, and what does it comprise?
173	ie..number and size of tanks, throughput in 2000.
173	The TNRCC letter was dated March 28, 2001 and we are required to provide information to them within 30 days.
173	I just received the letter today.
173	HELP!!
173	I need something from you by this afternoon or tomorrow at the latest.
174	Kermit Team, I really need your assistance on this.
174	I received a notice from the TNRCC about the above facility.
174	Apparently, the emissions fees for the facility have not been paid for 2000.
174	In light of this, does this facility exist in your area of responsibility?
174	Please let me know.
174	If so, I need the follwoing information ASAP to aviod an NOV for the facility.
174	Size of each tank height and capacity Number of tanks Color of tank(s) and roof(s) fixed or floating roof if floating, internal or external primary or secondary seals how is tank loaded and or unloaded ie trucks, pipeline etc...
174	Relative vapor pressure if known monthly throughput maximum fill rate of tank how long does it take to fill tank
175	Alison, have you found out anything about the above referenced?
175	The deadline for submitting the FY 2001 emissions fee is April 30.
175	The TNRCC can levee a fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty fast.
175	Your assistance in this will be appreciated.
176	Alison, better send me what you have via fed-x or fax (505) 627-8172.
176	I have spoken to Bill about this.
176	We need to send a check to the agency to cover ourselves prior to the April 30 deadline.
176	I beleive that EOTT is responsible for paying the fee.
176	I have left a message with Larry Fensted and his associate Ruth Ann and expressed the need for the $416.00 check by 4/1.
177	I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.
177	I have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline Group, to apprise you of this situation.
177	The content of materials received, I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.
177	Please be advised, that many times it is difficult to screen this material based upon the headings and titles that accompany the contents.
177	Consequently, innappropriate materials such as this are opened.
177	I have accidently opened two such e mails by mistake and have received the "Enron warning" that my name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has been placed in a file.
177	Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials.
177	I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.
177	Thank you very much.
178	Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.
178	All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the Koch office were reviewed.
178	Assumptions were made that the environmental records were complete for all assets included in the sale.
178	Primary emphasis was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of crude oil.
178	In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical assets which were reviewed.
178	Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the following: Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee payments were documented NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks were documented Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date SARA compliance and reporting had been completed SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112 Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were available for review There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site included in the asset for sale (permits for the remediation activity is in place) Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were documented Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a considered a major environmental liability.
178	This statement is again based upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the data room for the assets in question.
178	It should also be stated that this analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.
178	Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to each location to verify findings from the records review.
178	Also, due to the past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.
179	On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.
179	There were no issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.
179	A due diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping activities presented in the records review.
179	The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state of Colorado.
179	This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use as a result of a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.
180	Shudeish, the buildings and stack heights for each of the Flagstaff And Kingman Compressor Stations are presented below.
180	Building and stack demensions (in feet), are as follows: FLAGSTAFF length width height Port a Camp 40 10 10 Let me know if you need anything else.....
181	Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be aproblem.
181	If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.
181	For instancif a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978tank regulations.
181	If the tank had remained at its original location, it would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.
181	However, because the tanwas relocated, it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 1978 and subject to the 1978 regulations and is no longer grandfathered.
181	I was not given this information during the records review, so I dont know if any of the tanks apply.
181	If any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio,EOTT or Koch will be looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tankinto compliance.
181	Generally speaking, the regualtions and costs to complyincrease as a function of date.
181	1.
181	Q. Of the tanks listed on the spreadsheet, have any of the tanks been relocated from its original construction locations?
181	List the tank, date moved and location moved to.
181	A. Benevides Station Tank 6125 and Mirando Station Tank 28591 were relocatto those stations.
181	Three Rivers Tanks 28508 and 28100 were relocated andre-erected at that station.
181	Duval Station Tank 28052 and Mirando Station28045 were relocated and re-erected at those stations prior to Koch,sacquisition of those assets.
182	Arnold, I have attached a spreadsheet showing what information I need to complete the air permit applications.
182	I have set the Flagstaff site as the model, due to its elevation and temperature which is the worst case site.
182	Let me know if there are any problems with the attached data request.
183	Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area.
183	So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams have responded.
183	I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest convenience.
183	I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet for you to pass on to the teams.
183	Thanks for the help.
184	Hazardous waste fees were submitted to the state of Arizona.
184	Emissions fees were submitted to the state of New Mexico For C/S's 7,8,9, Atoka No. 3 and Bloomfield.
184	Submitted to the state of Texas an admisistraitve revision for the "like for like" replacement of an IC engine at Irion Co. No. 1 C/S.
184	To meet the requirements of 2 gms for NOx, a catalytic converter has been installed on the replacement unit.
184	Submitted to the state of New Mexico notification of a "like for like" replacement of an I/C engine at Atoka No. 2 C/S.
184	A revised Title V application was submitted to Region VI, EPA for C/S No. 6, Laguna.
184	The emissions inventory for the TW Keystone C/S was submitted to the state of Texas.
184	The spreadsheet development for the EOTT tanks in the Midland Region has slowed down.
184	Six of 13 teams have responded with tank information.
184	A request was made to Scott Clark, Regional Director, to assist in notifying the teams of the importance of submitting this data.
185	Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at the Bakersfield Fractionator.
185	The scheduled completion date for six of the items is 6/30.
185	I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during the audit.
185	Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items show up as deliquent in his region.
185	Whatever you can do to assist us in either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would be greatly appreciated.
186	Ed, I would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list from Scott Jones and choose which items are Koch's responsibility and which items belong to EOTT, and let Scott and I know.
186	Ill contact Scott and have him send you the action item list for your review.
186	As I had previously mentioned, Scott and I have until 6/30 to complete the subsurface investigations and knowing which items are EOTT's and which are Koch's would greatly help us.
186	As Scott's server is down, Ill phone him and have him send you the action item list.
186	Again Thanks very much.
187	Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta. 2 and Needles) are required to have an annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.
187	I have scheduled with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following dates: Kingman team June 21 Flagstaff team June 22 This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.
187	This training will last for approximately 2-3 hours.
187	Employees that works at any of the three facilities are required to be present for the training.
187	Your participation in this will be greatly appreciated.
188	Lorraine, Ill give you a call this afternoon.
188	By the way, did they test the liquids for PCBs?
188	I havent heard from the Gallup team on whether they have gone and checked for collected liquids at their I/C's.
188	Rick, can youcheck on this for me?
189	Louie, after the presentation MIchael gave, there were some issues about the data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the solvent or technology would or would not work.
189	The data did show that terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.
189	But because Penn State was so deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end.
189	There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.
189	The thought was that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it through would have meant 0 return for the money we had invested.
189	And if it works, the money would have been wisely used.
189	The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.
189	I signed a six month extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not for additional $$$$$$.
189	They needed the extra time to complete the modeling study and data evaluation.
189	Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating injection points and the pigging activities).
189	When the decision is made to begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready and waiting......

193	your resume is good enough b/c i gave it directly to the hiring people.
194	Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.
194	It seems we have items of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield which were tied into a previous agreement with Koch for which the action team did not know when the action items were prepared.
194	The action dates are approaching and Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the responsibility of Koch for some of the items.
194	Ed, the attorney for EOTT, will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.
194	If this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I.....
195	Laguna and or Moutainair team, because I dont know which team is responsible for the Belen delivery point, would someone check on liquids at this location and if present, collect a sample and have it analyzed for PCB's?
195	We're required to do this by the contract.
195	If no liquids are present, drop Lorraine and or myself a message stating such.
195	Thanx
196	Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez.
196	If the listing you saw says Edwin Coulter, he no longer is part of the group.
197	Bill, any delays on this project are NOT from the env.
197	matrix.
197	I received the matrix from the team sometime last week (tuesday -thursday) when I was out of town on business.
197	When I came back on friday, I completed the matrix and sent it back to the team.
197	Any delays on this issue are from the team, not from me.
197	As I remember the project, it involved work on the right of way and therefore was covered by the blankets we have for SHPO and F&W.
197	There were no project delays in terms of permits or approvals......
198	After reveiwing the documents entitled, "Baseline Environmental Investigation of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California" and "Report of Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area Tupman, California", it appears that the following areas should be investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of identified contamination from the above referenced reports: Tank 15 area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Wash rack area- lead Propane comp.
198	area lead total petroleum hydrocarbons Cooling tower area- chromates Compressor area- BTEX lead In the "Baseline Environmental Investigation" report, sampling was only conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.
198	I am not comfortable with basing decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the fact that many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.
198	This is indeed the case for chromates.
198	I based my recommendations for metal concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels for metals and evaluated the TPH and BTEX levels with the underground storage tank guidlines for California.
198	There were references to a 1989 document in the "Baseline" report for specific parameters, but there may have been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states for total petroleum hydrocarbons.
198	Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or the loading rack issues.
198	One last issue.
198	As you know, identification of contamination is usually accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of processes and or history.
198	Report results of the surface contamination do not show there to be an immediate environmental concern.
198	Due to the age of the facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.
198	However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the facility.
199	I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.
199	As a condition of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for identification.
199	After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.
199	The charges will depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the trees which are flagged.
199	As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.
200	Byron/Tiny, I spoke to Ken Jacobs with the Forest Service and have attached his e mail below concerning the Forest Sevice's choice for the building.
200	I have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain white which is consistent with the existing equipment.
200	He had no problems with this.
200	I also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the FS uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name, so I think the best thing would be to match as closely as possible.
200	The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted dark brown.
200	The color should be close to the color that we use for our signs.
200	Call me at 520-214-2464 if you would like to discuss this.

201	Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about the status of the study.
201	When will your progress report be ready for review?
201	It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.
201	Im glad that things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply something positive towards our situation.
201	Thanks for getting back with me.
202	Bob, James, Roger, Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.
202	Ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others.
202	Im under the gun as to finding out where the MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet.
202	This is where the teams assistance is required.
202	I have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will deliver it to the following teams for their valued input: Monahans Team Hamlin/Haskel Team Lamesa Team Big Lake Team Midland Team Eunice Team Your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated.

209	Im trying to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region.
209	Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc).
209	Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.
209	E mail works best for me.
209	Thanks again.
209	If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in Minnesota a couple of years ago.......
210	I need the 14,15,21 & 22 off.

215	Ivan, the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management.
215	They are having a big pow-wow this week to get things straightened out.
215	The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I will be speaking with him next week.
215	In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled to meet with the Arizona Director in a couple of weeks.
215	Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in Enron.
215	Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis.
215	Ill keep you apprised of the partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the Foundations new CEO........
216	Eunice team, The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit which was issued by the State of New Mexico.
216	The reports are required to be submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.
216	These reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.
216	If you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report.
216	This should take about half a day.
217	WHICH HR IS DIFFERENT?
218	John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation partnership.
218	After we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of an MOU or Agreement between Enron and the RMEF.
218	Looks like things are beginning to progress.
218	Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron employees about how they can get involved.
218	Any suggestions on how I can "advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement with the RMEF?
219	i'll change it in enpower
220	I just found out the group is fully staffed.
220	Going forward, they would only consider applicants with heavy experience.
221	u have my permission to change it
222	going forward, go by the settlement report
223	I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.
223	Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.
223	Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.
223	In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco.
223	I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.
224	I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.
224	The report is to be submitted by January 31st of each year.
224	If we need to discuss this, give me a call.
225	i'm in for the night stuff.
225	just tell me when and where.
226	i changed it
227	The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.
227	These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.
227	Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.
227	A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.
227	Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.
227	A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue.
227	Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.
227	Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine status of permit compliance with each air permit.
228	Kim, please give me a call at (505) 625-8022 concerning the above.
228	Im trying to generate employee interest in the RMEF and need some help.
228	Ive gotten some positive requests and involvement from some employees about the Foundation, but would like to open it up to others in Enron.
229	Be advised that there will be a meeting on Thursday 11:00 am August 23 at the NNG Turbine station, south of Kermit Tx.
229	to complete and submit annual certification reports which are required by the following Title V permitted facilities: Seminole Brownfield Plainview Irion Co. No. 1 Reagan Co. 2 Walton Keystone Kermit Turbine Should a team decide not to attend this meeting, be advised that the required submittal date for the annual certifications for the state of Texas is September 8, 2001.
229	It will be your teams responsibility to ensure that the certifications are submitted prior to the 9/8/01 deadline should you decide not to attend the August 23 meeting.
230	Participated in the compliation and submittal of the Title V semi annual monitoring and annual certification reports for the NNG Eunice C/S.
230	Data gathering and correspondance continues with the third party lawyer for the NOV issue at the P-1 C/S.
230	This involved a like for like replacement of a turbine in New Mexico.
230	Annual blanket renewal requests were submitted to the Texas SHPO and the Arizona F&W.
230	A permit be rule has been submitted to the TNRCC for the like for like I/C engine replacement at the NNG Reagan Co 2 C/S.
230	The EOTT tank database is 90% complete.
230	Field verification with each team will begin to determine compliance with recordkeeping, fees, NSPS and air permit status.
230	Air permits for the EOTT facilities in New Mexico were copied from the agencies records.
230	Compliance status will be determined for these facilities also.
231	John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1.
231	Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points?
231	Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations.
231	2.
231	PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment.
231	Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?
231	3.
231	Internal sampling activities.
231	How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system.
231	(wipe tests results versus liquids collections).
231	A map would be nice depicting this.
231	4.
231	Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral.
231	Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.
231	Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible.
231	5.
231	We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our future plans are.
231	Another Tranwestern effort to show our commitment.
231	John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.
231	If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.
231	Id like to discuss possibly not using Vector for this type of routene activity any longer.
231	There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.
231	As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is $$$$$$$, although they do a good job.
231	Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.
231	FYI in case you plan on asking him to attend the meeting........
232	In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance: Hobbs team August 6 8:00 am Lovington team August 7 8:00 am Jal team August 8 8:00 am Eunice team August 9 8:00 am I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.
232	Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.
232	If a conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022.
233	Travis, Count me in on Cozumel.
234	I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.
234	This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.
234	I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.
234	Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.
234	Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.
234	We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.
234	The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.
234	According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.
234	I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future.
234	In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings.
234	Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.
235	John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking in a company that is less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product.
235	Vector, has to travel from Ohio.
235	Deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel.
235	I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.
235	Tiny, do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?
235	As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities.
235	How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work.
235	I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff.
235	Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.
235	Thanks for your guidance and thoughts.
236	A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine exchange which occurred in 1996.
236	A history was given of the incidents which led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had been resolved.
236	The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.
236	Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases to the TNRCC.
236	The agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.
236	An incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led to this emergency training being given.
236	Based upon a phone call with Region 7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to facilities that submit incomplete "Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for Reportable Events".
237	A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater than 500 bbls.
237	per day.
237	If there is any tank within your teams area of responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls.
237	per day throughput criteria, please provide to me the following: tank name/serial number tank size average daily throughput Thanks for your help in this matter....
238	I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 2.
238	Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, provided that this is the only pre activity we do prior to receiving the air permit.
238	This means that no other construction or preparation activities can be performed or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.
238	This approval also includes stump removal if need be......
239	As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta.
239	3,4 and 5.
239	Jeff Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample collections at each of the three compressor station and has three months completed.
239	This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor station.
239	Stations 3 and 4: each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 agencies: Navajo Nation EPA Window Rock, AZ 86515 Atten: Yolanda Barney Program Manager US EPA Region IX 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6) Station 5: your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.
239	In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated that he will be handling the reporting for Station 4 also.
239	I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 4 and 5 reports to station 5.
239	The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.
239	Expect some changes in reporting.
239	Youmay want to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the submittal of the reports.
239	Questions, give me a call 505 625-8022..
240	please remove from list.
240	thank you.
241	The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.
241	There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector.
241	Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S.
241	The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S.
241	A custom fuel monitoring schedule reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S.

241	A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.
241	The meeting will be held in Albuq.
241	during the 1st or 3rd week in August.
242	Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy.
242	Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement.
242	Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.
242	You can click the button that says "Become a member" and sign up for the annual membership at that time.
242	At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a total by team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the Nature Conservancy by the end of the month.
242	Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated
243	i agree.
244	who r u?
244	r u a friend of Chi's?
245	you can reach me on my cell phone from now on.
245	713.628.0674.
245	call me.
245	i lost all your phone numbers.
246	no problems.
246	i enjoyed the game.
247	Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of touch for the last week.
247	I read John's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us.
247	As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum.
247	I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.
247	Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona, State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix.
247	I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there appears to be trouble on the horizon.
247	John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would like to take a more proactive approach "up front" with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.
247	Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway.
247	As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way.
247	Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.
247	Once the pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed for the following: threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion of the project require installation of horsepower.
247	The FERC will require an EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be conducted.
247	These activities include not only the environemntal issues but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc. Past consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).
247	Due to the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount for the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be walked and surveyed by several people.
247	I would rather wait until we can identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.
247	However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000 for the baseline environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at this time.
247	Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.
248	Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area......
249	George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.
249	I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.
249	Dave was going to inform the OCD that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite Bill's review process.
249	Ill let you know when I hear from the OCD.
250	Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project.
250	She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.
250	Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.
250	The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.
250	The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.
250	The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.
250	To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.
250	This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.
250	I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.
250	Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.
250	I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.
251	he's adorable...must take after his mom.
252	You must be really bored to be e-mailing me about that.
252	Just name the time and place.
253	The Southwest Region will be hosting its 2001 environmental roundtable in Albuquerque, NM on October 16-17 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.
253	Room rates are $89.00 per night.
253	Each attendee will be responsible for his/her room reservations for the two day event.
253	The agenda for this roundtable will be sent out in the near future.
253	If you would like to be a speaker and give a presentation on a topic or product please send to my attention for possible incorporation into the program.
253	In order to hold a sufficient block of rooms, provide adequate roundtable space and accomodations, your reply is required to my attention via emal or voice mail (505) 625-8022 by September 31.
254	Donna/Arnold sorry about not making the conference call today.
254	The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.
254	I felt the need to tag along with them....
254	Heres the way it is.
254	The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.
254	Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
254	This is not a new issue with the EPA.
254	Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.
254	The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.
254	I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.
254	(As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).
254	I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.
254	Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.
254	I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.
254	He advised me not to do this.
254	I think his decision had something to do with the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.
254	He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues.
254	Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly delay issuance of the permits.
254	Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA.
255	change per Settlement's request.
256	Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the MIdland Region.
256	Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.
256	A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.
256	All Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.
256	Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.
256	A contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.
256	This is not a new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian Lands.
256	The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.
256	Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.
256	Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th NFL meeting in MIdland.
257	Leon, thanks for the list.
257	If this is a complete list of the parts which are replaced, what parts are "common" between the 3505 and the 4700?
257	Bill Scott is the attorney on this for Enron and I have copied him on this correspondence "wcs@modrallcom."
257	Plese keep him in the loop on this......
258	Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the Midland Region.
258	A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.
258	Transwestern presented letters from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.
258	The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate the new evidence which had been given to them.
258	They indicated that they would be contacting us after they had reviewed this new data and information.
259	John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.
259	In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.
259	I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out.
259	Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.
259	I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and critical habitat issues etc) Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip...
260	NORTHERN NATURAL GAS Reviewed Title V Operating Permit renewal applications with field teams for Finney Co. 1, Finney Co. 3 and Fowler.

261	Looking forward to seeing you all and having a productive and interesting session.
262	Ruth, I spoke to the ADEQ about the accelerated permit program and apparently there are some internal problems with this program and the third party contractors which are on their "list".
262	At this stage of the game, they recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.
262	I then indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of Arizona.
262	The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea.
262	Because we will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and permit writing.
262	This way, I wont step on any toes.
262	By the way, the ADEQ said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.
262	The following time line for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff to do the required internal review and then the EPA is given a one month period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 permit applications in Arizona.
262	Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead Transwestern's case.
262	Ill let you know how it goes......
263	John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully, for both days.
263	Your presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment from Houston.
263	Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.
263	The second moring will be devoted to a "surprise" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.
263	I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station.
263	I plan on setting and hiding some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.
263	We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified.
263	The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift.
263	Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift?
263	I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.
263	The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams.
263	thoughts comments......
264	he did not.
264	but he did predict your homosexual preoccupations.
265	Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had a couple of crises I had to address, Im still realing from the impact.
265	I have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.
265	Take a look at the document and let me know what you think.
265	After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications.
265	I have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will undoubtably work for the others.
265	Thanks for your patience in this.
266	After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.
266	His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.
266	We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired.
266	Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.
267	Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.
267	This is the only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.
267	I asked about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not attend.
267	He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and who will be attending.
267	Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day for her.
267	Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's place?
268	Would you please check on the status of this expense report.
268	The last entry I had on it was 9/5/01, 13 days ago.
268	My AMEX bill will be charged interest if I dont receive a check in the near future.
268	YOur assistance in this will be greatly appreciated.
269	Dave, Could you send me a hard copy of the transactions in question.
269	I tried to pull them up on the website but i guess it doesn't keep records that far back.

270	NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE.
270	Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC.
270	A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat.
270	3 and 4 which are on Indain lands.
270	The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.
270	The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.
270	Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.
270	A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.
270	The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a normal issue date.
270	Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.
270	Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.
270	On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures.
270	This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

271	are you still working on your resume?
272	Thanks Scott, I heard about the same thing, and was checking futrher to see if this was actually the case....
273	Scott, I shold probably clearify something.
273	The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.
273	Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.
273	Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal with them.
273	I appreciate your wirk in this......
274	Hi, Have you had a chance to talk with Kevin or Dana about my moving over to scheduling.
274	If not, should I approach them with my request.
274	Larry
275	Roger, thats great that the public notice for station 3 and 4 air permits will initiate on October 4.
275	I really appreciate your work and effort on this.
275	I will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the permits during the first week of October.....
276	John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPApermits for 3 and 4.
276	Briefly here they are.
276	First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.
276	It applies to hoursof operation for the generator.
276	The ADEQ has restricted hours of operationbecause we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.
276	In talking to Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered.
276	This is there policy not regulation.
276	What is ironic is thatthey accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate thatthey would apply any safety factor for their comfort.
276	Im concerned about the time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.
276	I needsome guidance.
276	Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lonit will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?
276	In speakinwith Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches thPSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of controtechnology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.
276	I knowtime is of the essence.
276	Second issue.
276	The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hror ton/yr.
276	The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppmfor NOx and CO) at base load operation.
276	GE will guarantee this.
276	However, at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are40 ppmvd for NOx and CO. We cant live with this.
276	In our application, westated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and weapplied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presentedthis in lb.hr and tons/yr.
276	This would have covered us, but because the permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed these limits during low loadsand low temps.
276	I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads withwith requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he woubring this before his management.
276	Ill keep you apprised of this issue.
277	Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.
277	For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD.
277	This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for the generator from 8760 to 7800.
277	This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.
277	Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor.
277	For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.
277	Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.
277	It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.
277	Northern Natural Gas Company A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.
277	Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.
277	Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 100 ton/year sources.
277	Continued investigation is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility.
277	A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.
277	New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit.
277	General Preparations are being finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque.
278	Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and Flagstaff.
278	He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will do an expidited review.
278	Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request an expidited review of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.
278	Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.
279	Shudeish, our advisor in Arizona left me a voice mail message that the signs were posted at both locations...thanks for your help with an expited request to Region IX EPA.
280	Amy, John Kinser and I will be attending.
280	Larry
281	thanx dude.
282	please remove me from all future distributions.
283	Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?
283	The reason I ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix D. We have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use "stain tubes" or total sulfur analyzers.
283	These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.
283	I can send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.
283	If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details.
283	WIll it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit for you and us?
284	please remove from distribution list
285	yes, increase it.
286	please remove from distribution list.
287	Title whatever you want.
287	Just one cd.

288	John, in response to you questions below, im da man.
288	Ill call you today or tomorrow concerning your possible suggestions and recommendations for dinner, blocking the rooms and the time for the event....the group had originally planned on blocking out 70 rooms.
288	Enough for the field DES's, safety specialists, env.
288	and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct reports, Rich Jolly and his advisors, plus guests and speakers.......anyone else?
289	Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.
289	Stations 1 and 2.
289	The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.
289	I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.
289	He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.
289	These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.
289	The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ.
289	at 7:00 pm.
289	I plan on being there.
289	Williams is located approx.
289	30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.
289	The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.
289	So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.
289	In EPA's review process, they had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.
289	We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.
289	We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility. This should save you about $40K).
289	There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.
289	This has been resolved also.
289	Stations 3 and 4.
289	I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.
289	He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.
289	There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.
289	The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov. 3.
289	After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.
289	As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4.
289	Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.
290	Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.
290	I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer, about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.
290	My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.
290	If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.
290	In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?
290	By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be OK.
290	If we decide to do the turbine project within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.
290	If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.
290	Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility..
291	Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.
291	We are now free to initiate construction at these two sites....
292	I AM NOT THE LARRY CAMPBELL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
293	THANJ YOU.
294	THANK YOU.

296	Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at this facility emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.
296	Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test with a portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed very high emissions.
296	We have a couple of options.
296	Spend the $$$$ necessary to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.
296	The choice is yours.
296	Understand, this permit if issued, places some recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.
296	Let me know what you would like to do.
297	THANK YOU
298	Charlie, can you take care of this?
298	Please respond and let me know your thoughts...
299	Go for it
300	Teams, Danny Collier, Region IX, EPA in Sanfrancisco, has requested that we fax to him at 415-947-3549 the water well coliform bacteria reports for the Leupp and Klagetoh C/S for October and November.
300	Please send this to him at your earliest convenience.
301	who cares
302	Ed I have been busy in Az and have neglected your email.
302	Sorry about that.
302	Is there a one page form that I can submit that will say that nothing has changed at a faility in the last 5 years for the below facilities?
302	Either that or I can write a one page letter stating this fact and reqeust that the OCD renew the permit again.
302	Which is best for you?
303	Thanks, I needed that
304	Scheduling Issue: 1024 MIRANT(Rala) told me that they could not schedule anymore transactions with me.
304	She confirmed they were defaulting on their contracts.
304	1050 Informed DYPMI(Katherine) that MIRANT was defaulting on their contracts thus preventing me from fulfilling my obligation to DYPMI.
304	1200 Russell spoke to the DYPMI trader to discuss LD protocol.
304	Option Issue: 904 MIRANT(Blake Mason) would not accept my exercising of an option.
304	He confirmed they were defaulting on a firm LD product.
304	1051 Told WESCO(Sherry) that MIRANT's defaulting prevented me from fulfilling my obligation to them.
304	1200 WESCO(Sherry) informed me WESCO was going to LD ENRON.
305	Stations 3,4 and 5.
305	I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation.
305	Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.
305	Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.
305	I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.
305	His fax number is (415) 947-3549.
305	I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.
306	Bill, I have this outstanding bill notice which I keep getting form iPayit.
306	There are about 5 invoices from Argent for EOTT work which they did in 2001.
306	It was for the Midland EOTT compliance stuff.
306	I dont know how to let the system know that these invoices have been taken care of.
306	Is there someone you know of who can let iPayit know that these invoices have been taken care of?
307	No. His e-mail is physics123@yahoo.com and home number is 7-662-3006
308	Scott, it seems that the letter we received from Danny is otherwise.
308	In the process of having the Navajo EPA take over the drinking water program for the Tribe, the EPA as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer.
308	In light of this, we need to not only send to the EPA all monthly sampling reports for drinding, but also to the Yolanda Barney of the Navanl Nation.
308	I spoke with Danny about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start to deminish in the future but he didnt when.
309	Randy, I tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered.
309	I thought you might have changed your address.
309	Guess I typed it in by mistake.
309	(age does that to you sometimes).
309	Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.
309	I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.
309	There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.
309	Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.
309	Well see.
309	Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.
309	Sorry to hear that there is the word "reorganization" in Hess.
309	this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.
309	I hate this kind of stuff.
309	I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.
309	Ill keep you in prayer.
309	Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?
309	Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.
309	Just like Peter wrote, were just pilgrims in a foregin land, waiting for the trip home and promise of Christ's return.
310	Thought you might like this...
311	You know I used to work for a director in ETS that always gave 103%, now I know how he did it, not really, just kidding....
312	this is cute, things like this help during difficult times
313	Don I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God hate to see pain hit a family member.
313	Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.
313	Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.
313	That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.
313	When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.
313	So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him.
313	Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him.
313	Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.
313	If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.
313	I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your Christian walk.
313	I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities.
313	When you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.
313	Sharing Christ with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations.
313	In Hebrews were told to encourage the brethren.
313	I would consider it an honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...
313	its all we have........|
314	Thanks Randy, Ive heard him on the radio
315	Sta.
315	3 and 4, I am sending to you via regular mail, the new air permits for the Redrock Expansion.
315	I will be contacting you in the near future about coming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between you and me.
315	If you get some time, I would suggest that you look over each permit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is on your existing permit.
315	the old permit will expire when the facility begins operation of the turbine.
315	For Station 4, if a turbine is not installed at your location, this new permit wont apply.
315	But in the event it happens, you have the permit.
315	Bottom line, you need to keep this permit at each location.
316	Thanks, Roger.
316	Im on board with this.
317	Rich, concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact Transwestern if Duke should direct the liquids from their 8" line into the pipeline liquids tank at Wt-1, I have a concern. The liquids that are generated in the 8" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the Duke line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.
317	Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.
317	Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.
317	Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.
317	Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.
317	Based upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.
318	Thanks Michael for the brief update.
318	it sounds encouraging.
318	I am looking forward to putting the model into motion.
318	No problem with signing the no cost extension for the project, send it my way.
319	FYI from Penn State on the progress of the model to remove PCB's from Transwetern's pipeline.
320	Ray, Kay had mentioned that your team was having an OCD inpsection this week (Wednesday?).
320	Ive tried to contact you a couple of times to see if you might need some help, but was unsuccessful.
320	Is there something wrong with your phone?
320	Give me a call if you feel uncomfortable about any issue prior to their visit.
320	I will be in the office on wednesday but gone from 11:30 am-1:45 pm.
320	Let me know how the inspection went.......
321	Thanks John, Ill keep you posted.
321	Hows your pulse?
321	Doing OK?
322	Me too.
322	Thats what Im doing.
322	Staying away from the gossip and grip sessions.
322	Its nice to know that He's a big enough God to handle all problems and concerns, even the ones in Enron.....
323	10-4.
323	I saw a picture of Dustin's deer, pretty nice.
323	someone from BLM told me a deer came in from the sandhills east of town that was 29" and non typical. I also heard of some deer that were taken north of town that were pretty nice also (16-24").
323	Dont you think it s funny that we spend all kinds of money and time traveling to all our secret spots and the big ones are right in our back yard?
323	Im planning on taking some time off for the holidays, so If I dont hear from you have a wonderful Christmas and keep your focus on the Lord, He's our only salvation.
323	So often we look to other things to give us security and joy and we so often forget, that for those that love Him and have confessed Him as our Savior He is our strength and hope of a future eternal glory.....May God be your source of strength, Merry Christmas...
324	Charlie, when Butch had Getman's wife count the number of people using the water at Station 5, did the number of users not equal the public water system numbers (ie 25 people daily at least 60 days per year?) I though we were always a public water system at Station 5?
324	We better discuss this, as we could be in some trouble if we do service 25 people and are not doing the sampling.....
325	I HAVE submitted all receipts for the expense reports submitted to you.
325	I will resend them again.
326	David, I got hte same message from Don.
326	I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.
326	Im sure hes going through a tough period now.
326	If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.
326	Thanks for the prayers.
326	Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.
326	what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.
326	It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.
326	I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.
326	So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.
326	Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also.
326	Im glad for that.
326	I know hes under a lot of stress.
326	It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.
326	If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.
326	The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.
326	I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now.
326	Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.
326	Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.
326	This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.
326	I hope that this turns many to Jesus.
326	Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.
326	If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.
326	Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....
327	I received this message
328	Cute, Mr. McMinn.
328	HOws things in Santa Fe?
329	Im on vacation till Jan. 2.
329	If you want to discuss this, give me a call at the house (505) 624-0353.
330	Bill Ive got an "I pay it" notification for some Argent invoices for EOTT that keeps coming to my mailbox.
330	Im pretty sure that you have allready paid these.
330	I keep getting notifications and dont know how to notify the system that these have been taken care of.
330	To let you know which EOTT invoices Im speaking of, Ill forward them to your attention.
331	I received this message
332	David, the next matrix yousend in, please provide information in box D where is asks for location of activities.
332	station yard, right of way, tandk farm etc...
333	Thanks, Celestine, everything appears to be working fine.....
334	John, Im in the office for a few hours cleaning out email and stomping out some minor fires.
334	The two RMEF persons we met with are Dan Walker and Allen Kerby.
334	Allen is the regional director for NM and TX.
334	Dan was the guy we picked up at the airport from Montana.
334	I think his title was VP of business operations?
334	His number is 1-800-225-5355.
334	Allen's number in Las Vegas NM is 505-454-9390.
334	Hope that all is well with you and the family.
335	thanks, Danny for sending out this heads up
336	Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.
336	If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.
336	Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.
336	My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.
336	Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.
336	Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.
336	One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.
336	I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.
336	Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it.
337	David got your voice mail last week.
337	Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vacation.
337	Im not going to give it away anymore.
337	I would have liked to talked to you.
337	Things are somewhat stressful around here.
337	Probably worse in Houston.
337	Enron is screening e mails so everyone is a little tense.
337	Lots of things are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.
337	As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Stevens were among those.
337	Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.
337	This was a good time to take my vacation.
337	This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort.
337	Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.
337	Hows Christmas in the desert?
337	Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?
337	this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.
337	David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Christmas.
337	I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.
337	When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.
337	I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people in Katar and remember the love of Christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.
337	I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.
337	May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His love and grace.
337	Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ
338	Mark, this is correct
339	David I got your test
340	Adel, please send this blank matrix to the project manager and have them complete the title information amd items A through E in the upper box on the first page, then send it to me.
340	This will greatly assist me in determining what permits, plans and other regulatory documents will be requried.
340	thanks
341	Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.
341	I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.
341	I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.
341	Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.
341	It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.
341	I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.
341	When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.
341	I can send it one more time if you want me too.
341	Let me know.....
342	MIke attached is my PEP with the revised changes.
342	This is being faxed to Bill

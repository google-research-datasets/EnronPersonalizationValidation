102	We notified Curtis Smith and Bill Kasemervisz the following business day last Monday - July 24th.
102	For future reference, please let us know exactly how much notice is required and if you think there are other groups we may have missed notifying so that this does not become a problem again.
102	Thanks for your help.
103	Here is the file.
104	Thanks Bill.
105	Please make the following changes for me please: No Vacation on Sept. 11 Change my late day from sept 12 to sept 19 schedule vacation on Sept. 18th.
105	Please call with any questions.
105	Thanks.
106	Here is the file.
106	Thanks.
107	what day?
108	Give me a break...just like last year, I will finish ahead of you again.
108	Mean machine will be PLove's bitch again this year.
109	Glad to hear your trip was wonderful.
109	Things are great hear.
109	We are anxiously awaiting the arrival of football season and our annual trips back to Auburn.
109	Where is Steve's new job?
109	Are you guys still planning on going to the Friday night party at Cadillac Bar.
109	I have to hurry and send in my money for the event.
109	Talk to you soon.
110	How about Eric Moulds and Kevin Faulk for Ed McCauffrey, Yancy Thigpen and Mike Cloud
111	Here is the email reminder of the curve setting process.
111	After you set your curves(do not hit finished file), go to the GD Pmgr tab and change the date in the left hand corner to two business days out(Friday set for Tuesday).
111	Then go to the CurveFetch tab and place your file on automatic calc(can not hit F9).
111	Then hit fetch Prices button.
111	Prices should be brought in for current date.
111	Go to the AutoCurve tab and hit paste curves.
111	When this is done, hit finished file and the date will be updated so that I know your curves are ready to load in ERMS.
111	Please feel free to shout with any questions.
111	Thanks.
112	Macros Intra Month Physical Calcs Fixed for Floats
113	Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical liquidations: Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.
113	All three of these equalled the 3.7 million.
113	You should use the revised and the capacity hedge file.
113	When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).
113	This amount should be a "desk adjustment".
113	We have accounted for the variance in our current month (0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.
113	Please shout with any questions.
114	Cathy please seperate two items from your original list.
114	TAGG#N50101.C for $897,332 and TAGG#N70687.7 for $659,979.
114	These two liquidations relate to a NGPL storage deal on the desk that should have variances for several months.
114	The net amount of these two liquidations is $237,353.
114	For now, please put this item on the backpage on it's own line.
114	We will reconcile the other storage lines in the next few weeks and see what if anything needs to be added to this line.
114	At that time we will work out the necessary steps to get this item off of the backpage.
114	Scott is still looking at TAGG#N38268.L for $1,443,519 for the remainder of the balance for May.
114	Shout with any questions.
115	Done.
116	I passed it off today to someone in the Public Relations dept.
116	I will also look on our bulletin board and see what if anything is out there.
117	I bid $2 of Miami's D and $1 on Detroit's D
118	I bid $0 on New Orleans D
119	I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations file.
119	There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we flashed and what detail we now have.
119	We will have to take this adjustment to the P&L(wil be expense).
119	I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or LT Transport.
119	I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you each month by Cernosek's group.
119	For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed ($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).
119	The detail in this file plus these three numbers should tie out.
119	If not, please let me know.
119	Shout with any questions.
119	Thanks for your help.
120	Sorry I did not get back with you yesterday.
120	We have been really busy around here.
120	I called the person that I gave your resume to and she is on a business trip until early next week.
120	Her assistant is going to have her call me when she returns.
120	Apparently she left the day after I gave her the resume.
120	I will keep you informed.
120	If you look on our website www.enron.com and you see anything that interests you, let me know and I will put the resume in. Talk to you soon.
121	Enron North America Corp.
122	sure.
122	Just give me a shout.
122	Next week will not be good and I would prefer if we could do it before 2 p.m.
122	Let me know.
123	Ask Why....Why doesn't the Ask Why commercials work?
124	I changed the first deal, the second one NZ3403, Kam got a call from credit that this should be with ECC.
124	We have a sheat from Bruce Mills that says all deals with Dynegy Canada should be through ECC.
125	I will be there.
125	It is bid week, remind me.
126	no thanks.
127	According to the trader, this is a gas daily daily for the balance of month.
127	This may be a hedge for them for a physical deal, but it is financial from our perspective.
128	Per Bruce Mills - this goes through ENA
129	Tell him it is firm.
129	We are obligating ourselves no matter what.
129	And tell him thank you again.
129	See you tonight pretty lady.
130	I like it when you call me sailor.
131	I have rugby practice on Tuesday's and Thursday's.
131	I can do it before work, long lunch or Monday/Friday.
131	Let me know.
132	Please provide me a list of deal numbers that need to be changed.
132	From you email I gather you are saying that all deals done by ENA with a Canadian Counterparty need to be ECC/3rd party and then flipped to ENA book/FT-US/Cand/ERMS.
132	Is this correct?
133	Check this out.
133	Can't remember if I have sent this to you before.
134	Are you the same Ashley Lord that went to Clear Lake High School.
134	I think I saw the Ashley Lord I went to high school with in the lobby and thought this might be you.
134	If not, please disregard my email.
134	Thanks.
135	There are four of us that are not playing tomorrow?
136	done
137	Well, did you survive the week without your husband?
137	I am sure things are alot calmer now at home.
137	How is the little one?
137	Jackson is into everything.
137	Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and I hung out all day.
137	I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.
137	Ash was real proud.
138	Good to hear from you as well.
138	Last I heard, you were running a dating service...What happened with that?
138	I have been at Enron for close to 3 years.
138	Ashley and I have a 18 month old son, Jackson.
138	Mom is doing good, as we all are.
138	How do you like Enron so far?
138	I absolutely love it.
138	I am in the Risk Management Group for Natural Gas Trading.
138	Dealing with the traders can be fun, but is usually quite challenging.
138	Unfortunately we have a lot of late nights waiting on systems - like we are right now.
138	What group are you with?
138	Where are you living these days?
138	We just built a house in PineBrook in Clear Lake.
138	We had our ten year reunion last weekend...quite strange.
138	I don't know if you know them, but several CL graduates work here.
138	Meredith Mitchell, Dawn Kenne, Mike Pyer.
138	Our curves just came out, so I am going to start calcing my P&L.
138	Talk to you later.
139	what room?
140	Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man The ties that bind Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times Times Sports Staff AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.
140	Five straight games had been lost.
140	Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble, despair and losing.
140	More Auburn football Talkin' Tigers Forum ''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said.
140	''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.'' On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans.
140	They prayed.
140	They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take.
140	A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters and reserves.
140	It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about football.
140	It was about matters of the heart.
140	''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said.
140	''Since then, it's just like another thing on the itinerary.
140	It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there.
140	We've got five or six coaches.
140	Coach Tuberville comes in there.
140	People just lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.'' Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night.
140	Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger.
140	It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi State.
140	Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times.
140	Pate knows about pain and even fear.
140	A mysterious disease, now seemingly under control, threatened his senior season.
140	''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said.
140	''With me, it was my health.
140	Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me.
140	We said a prayer together.
140	Man, I was crying.
140	''It's like that every weekend.
140	Somebody on this team is suffering through something.
140	They share it.
140	When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.'' On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season.
140	Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school.
140	''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said.
140	''They get along.
140	We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better.
140	''It's just a special group.
140	They enjoy being around each other and understand what it's going to take for us to win.'' The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.
140	''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said.
140	''If you have trust in your teammates, you can build a good team.
140	Right now, we've got that going.'' It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college football.
140	They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997.
140	Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.
140	They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting.
140	They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.
140	No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard.
140	He went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when hardly anyone thought he could.
140	Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.
140	''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said.
140	''No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise.
140	Everybody just wants to win ball games.
140	The relationships we have on this team are like brothers.'' Leard says nothing that happens can change that.
140	''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said.
140	''We've got people excited.
140	We're excited.
140	The fun is back in it for us.
140	''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk.
140	There are no fingers being pointed anywhere.
140	There are no individuals on this football team.'' Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson.
140	Every Friday night, Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.
140	''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said.
140	''He's a great example of somebody who lives what he talks.
140	He's a role model, not just for younger people but for all of us.''
141	Hey goofball.
141	I sent this to you yesterday.
142	I have even read where Ronney Daniels has said he does not mind having a reduced role as long as we win.
142	Hopefully the good times will continue.
142	I get all of those articles from that website ww.tigeronline.com.
142	It is an outstanding website.
142	That article was from the Huntsville Times.
142	See you soon.
143	You finally win a game and you think your team rules...typical alabama fan.
143	The scuddle butt I hear is that Jackie Sherrill will be you next coach...Did you play with him?
143	We will see if Auburn is for real this weekend.
144	I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any way.
144	We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?
144	Since we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?
144	I know there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?
144	Wasn't really sure.
144	We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m.
144	and her grandmother lands at 6 p.m.
144	so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.
144	Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?
144	Talk to you soon.
145	Congrats on the future addition.
145	We are all doing good.
145	Jackson is 20 months and walking and talking up a storm.
145	Definitely keeping us on our toes.
145	The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate program.
145	The person to contact that is responsible for that program is Kristin Gandy, her number is 713-345-3214.
145	I have no idea what all the requirements are and when they recruit.
145	What type of position is he interested in - Treasury?
145	I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.
145	Oil and Gas experience is not a necessity, just a plus.
145	Enron really encourages diversity in every form, even experience.
145	By far the best company I have ever worked for.
146	It was good to talk to you live.
146	I miss our chats, but this is the wrong time and place to discuss that.
146	Please do not fret at all about not asking me to stand up.
146	For what it is worth I didn't ask you either.
146	I think you are correct it would have been akward for both of us.
146	This week is a time when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that are pulling at you.
146	So you know, do not worry about us, we are there to celebrate with you and meet your family.
146	Take care of the other high maintenance people, because you will be suprised how many there are.
146	Try and relax and enjoy it.
146	I am looking forward to seeing you in that dress.
146	See you soon.
147	I will bid $6 for Cary Blanchare, K Arizona and $3 for Gary Anderson K Minn
148	Here it is.
149	Here it is...you gonna split the money with me right??
150	Just curious how I may assist in getting Auburn University's name added to recruiting endeavors.
150	Of course I am an alum, and I believe you will find we have an excellent engineering and business school.
150	Just curious, thanks.
151	Enjoy..I was crying with laughter.
152	I found this picture of you shooting a shotgun, you crazy man.
153	Yeah, waht are you offering?
154	It is an absolutely hilarious video of a pakistani man firing a shotgun in a range and the gun shooting out of his hand and him yelling at his friends.
154	Real player should be able to play it - that is what I used.
154	I had a good time.
154	Send me those pics.
154	It was great seeing everybody and give us a shout the next time you are in town.
155	I think it is arabic for holy shit, I broke my shoulder.
156	How about Jacques Green and Mike Alstot.
157	I will throw in Troy Brown, Kevin Johnson and James Allen.
158	If he did that, he might have come back with a little buckshot in his ass.
159	Thanks for your help, I will keep that in mind.
160	Here they are.
160	Look how large some people are (Leo and Mitchell).
160	I managed to stay clear of the photos.
161	I do not know who you are, but I definitely do not appreciate the email that you sent me.
161	I do not agree with your politics and please remove me from your list.
162	How does Fear have any money left...he has been bidding the house...I think we need some bid accounting here.
163	Here they are.
164	Man, I was needing some help this week....
165	I think that last comment should have been directed solely to O'Neal.
166	When are you running for office Eric, you have my vote.
167	You need to stop lying to these boys, you know damn well this old guy was with you step for step.
168	can you reverify the deal ID.

168	Thanks.
169	There has been a slight change to our email addresses.
169	Please send future emails to phillip.m.love@enron.com Thanks.
170	Sent to wrong address originally.
171	Send those dirty jokes to my home email - plove570@cs.com.
171	They are pretty ruthless here about offensive emails.
171	I still want to see the jokes though.
171	Are you still enjoying the computer?
171	I need to spend some time getting our home machine organized.
171	Talk to you soon.
172	We do look pretty bad.
172	As long as we win that game at the end of November...I will be happy.
172	How was the trip to NYC?
172	I bet you guys had a blast.
173	Sorry.
173	I have always listed the address as plove @enron.com How are things going with you?
173	Good I hope.
173	We just got back from Denver.
173	Rachel Bonilla's wedding.
173	Boy the weather and the air are beautiful up there.
173	We really considered moving.
174	Yes, I did get in touch with him.
174	Thanks again for the info.
174	He is just being a beach bum...not really doing anything.
174	Guess I should have figured that.
175	DONE.
176	Welcome back.
177	Did you see the first three games of the divisional series?
177	4 of the 6 starters were former Astro pitchers - within the last three years.
177	Halama, Garcia for Seattle - Randy Johnson trade, Hampton and Kyle.
177	How sickening is that.
177	However, McClain has said he is going to up the budget for next year
178	A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.
178	I then went around to everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in everyone's pocket.
178	If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince them, let me know.
178	By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?
178	DO I have to wait until the end of the season.
179	Done.
179	FYI, according to Trey, this does not go through ECC because it is physical..do you agree?
179	I changed sitara as well.
180	Is it 6 a.m. out there?
180	What in the hell are you already doing at work?
181	I know what you mean.
181	As far as the bed goes, you should do what I do...Go around to the other side and push your wife into the wet area.
182	I agree with you.
182	We are going skiing in January.
182	If ya'll want to come or come to a football game in the fall.
182	I am not sure if we can make it out there before the end of the year.
182	I have spoken for all of my vacation days.
182	Did you see the sorry Astros released Cami today?
182	The man gave up all of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out him.
182	Typical Drayton McClain.
182	Talk to you tomorrow.
183	I vote for a long lunch one day of the week or 6 p.m.
183	on Monday or 6 p.m.
183	on Wednesday
184	Does Denise have any interest in learning to ski?
184	I think it is an absolute blast.
184	How are the negotiations going between Gwynn and the Padres?
185	Pretty humorous.
186	Yeah man, tell me about that crazy night before.
186	You know us married guys have to live vicariously through our single friends.
186	Next time you are headed this way, please do give me a shout, we will have to get together and catch up.
186	We can shoot a little pool at my house or go out to a bar.
186	Good luck with the financing, please keep me informed.
186	Thanks for the nice thoughts, same goes from me bro, I have been thinking about you for some time and hoping things were going well, I am glad they are going well.
187	I do not think I will be able to attend due to bid week.
187	We are usually extremely busy during bidweek and we will be short handed.
187	Please advise of any future sessions.
187	Thanks.
188	We are having so much fun, we do not know what to do with ourselves.
188	The P&L's are hosed, we are going to Fletch's happy hour now, maybe the numbers will make sense after that.
189	I ran a forwards detail for you on the deal from friday Q52255.1, price of 3.85.
189	This deal is currently losing roughly $3,000.
190	That really embarasses me.
191	How ashamed I am to read this.
192	The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.
192	It appears the files were not prepared by risk.
192	I have prepared the files and attached them.
192	Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing?
192	Thanks for your help, please call with questions.
193	FYI.
194	I guess I would be in, what is the fee going to be.
194	It is a crap load of work.
195	I bid $3 on Troy Drayton
196	Tim Duncan is what ever the draft personnel categorize him as.
196	Guranteed victories??
196	What is your record this year thrill kill?
196	What was your record in basketball?
196	Enough said.
197	Pretty damn funny.
198	From all I have read, he seems to always thank his offensive line and recievers first.
198	I heard that is what he said as soon as he got the game ball Saturday.
199	I can always count on you to put a unique spin on something.
199	I am more concerned with him staying for his senior year.
200	He led the nation last year -JUCO- in rushing and touchdowns and was JUCO player of the year.
200	He went to Butler JUCO and led them to a national championship.
200	In the national championship game, he had 300 yards and 7 touchdowns.
200	He has 3 touchdowns so far this year over 70 yards.
200	He is a welcome addition to our poor running game.
201	The hell you did...don't be a dumb ass.(you need to remember who is giving you tickets this weekend).
202	bring it.
202	I guess you are right, you don't need tickets, hope you don't need any the rest of the season.
202	I give you that whoopin at the bar this weekend.
203	We are in bid week right now, so I have to work late and can not take vacation, so I am catching a 10 p.m.
203	flight out tomorrow and get to auburn about 2 a.m. I will be at your brother's by 7:15 a.m. on game day - you better be ready.
203	I am coming in on Thursday night for the Georgia game and may stay in Birmingham that night...any vacancies?
203	I think we may play golf on Friday.
204	thanks man.
204	I will let you know.
205	I understand Mick's point of view...So for everyone, I will also share my day...Get out of bed, shower, brush teeth, comb hair, don't forget that deodrant(that's both arms)...Take the bus..book deals til 5 p.m.
205	and calc three books....Get the point.
205	We are all busy, welcome to Enron.
205	I think the point of the message, which I think should be directed at a few individuals that have shown a pattern..DON'T COMMITT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT INTEND TO DELIVER UPON.
206	I don't have to be talking about basketball to get the pattern...I am sorry, I didn't realize your girl told you about our morning routines.
207	Actually I was told it was a military invention and that we simply licensed the technology rights.
208	Thanks.
208	I know for a fact he felt the same way.
209	Speaking of chargers, when is Ryan Leaf going to be stoned to death in the town square?
210	I figured you would come back with that.
210	Did he ever marry that charger doll or whatever they are called or did she wise up to the scam?
211	HEAD!!
211	PANTS!!
211	NOW!!
211	That boy's cranium should is a virtual planetoid..It should have it's own weather system.
211	That was low, the poor boy will probably cry himself to sleep on his large pillow.
211	Great flick.
212	By the way....Do you need any tickets for the Georgia game?
212	I think I will have two extra.
212	Let me know.
212	Thanks.
213	Now it is on...bring it Bass.
213	The PLove is back to sew up this league like I am doing in football.
213	Come down my way and hand over my share of this week's pot.
213	I guess I will get the pool again this week since I am playing you, the only one with a chance to outscore me.
214	GEAUX TIGERS!!!
214	Stock up on those Sharpies!!
215	works for me!
216	Per Bass- like last year we get 13 guys, one must remain on IR for the entire week.
216	Note - the person does not have to be injured.
216	Pickups and drops are every monday.
216	If you do not know how to add/drop, ask any of us from last year.
217	Thanks for the pics.
218	Guess this should not come as a suprise to us.
218	Unfortunately, rumor has it today Dubose will be fired.
219	FYI - Barry was not there last week.
220	Thought you might want some late breaking news.
221	That was nice!!!
221	I forgot what your reply was, do you need any of the two extra tickets I have for Saturday?
221	Thanks.
222	I have no idea, I went and early voted.
222	Have fun standing in line.
222	Call Paul Bettencourt - Tax Assessor's office.
223	Sure.
224	All done.
225	I plan on attending.
226	Man, I wish you could have made it to the reunion.
226	We had a really good time and it was good to see everybody.
226	What are you doing in Norway for a job?
226	I am still enjoying Enron.
226	I am headed to Auburn this weekend for our last home game of the season.
226	Should be fun.
226	If we make it over to Europe any time soon, we will look you up.
226	We will probably wait until Jackson is a little older so that he will enjoy it more.
226	How is your Pop doing?
226	I bet he hates having you so far away.
226	Did you purchase a new bronco when you got to Europe or have the old one shipped over?
226	Boy did we cruise in that thing.
226	Stay in touch.
227	I will try and get it for you.
228	what is the word on the tickets?
228	Have you heard from your older brother?
228	I think he is planning on spending the night at my house tomorrow, but I have not heard from him.
229	I was just curious, thought Bill might need some, but I heard from him and he is good on tickets, so they are still yours for the taking.
230	The $33.82 rate I was qouted was after tax.
230	I specifically asked this question on the phone and at the airport.
230	Not a good way to do business.
231	I got Steve's email address.
231	Here it is: Good luck.
231	Stay in touch.
232	I still have them and they are yours..as always, only stipulation is that I get to go in with you and get my free coke.
232	Still have not heard from your brother.
233	All yours bro.
234	When are you coming down to Auburn?
234	Your brother and I are going tonight and may set up the tent on Friday.
235	I wanted to pass along some items I would be interested in for Brown Bags: Options Greeks End of month procedures Thanks

238	Are you guys still thinking of maybe joining us skiing?
238	Hope so.
239	Sign me up for light microwave popcorn.
240	Pretty funny.
241	Absolutely hilarious!!
242	I have friends who have no jobs or do not have to work at their jobs, therefore they can surf all day long and find good jokes.
242	Those are two of my favorites as well.
243	I hope you know I am sending these to you in jest.
243	I think it is funny.
243	In all seriousness, good luck this weekend.
243	Even with your record, I am nervous.
244	Price is changed.
244	Geoff Storey did not want to argue with counterparty.
245	No changes for me - Sithe.
246	I have been meaning to email you all day.
246	I have been extremely busy as wel.
246	I am sorry to hear that.
246	Ashley and I were looking forward to going out to dinner with you guys on Saturday.
246	Maybe we will call your folks and see if they would like to go out for your dad's bday.
246	I will have to give him a call tomorrow to wish him happy birthday.
246	Do you have his number at work or an email at work?
246	Thanks.
246	We look forward to seeing you soon.
246	Take care.
247	Do you want to go over to the game in two weeks?
247	I got four tickets - 2 for your brother and 1 for me.
247	Ashley is staying home.
247	Let me know.
248	Going with the old hyphen huh???
248	How corporate of you.
248	Hey, we got the beer.
248	Thanks alot.
248	Did customs give you a hard time for bringing a bunch of booze back?
248	Talk to you soon.
249	Your lucky those cans didn't explode and get all over your clothes huh?
249	Thanks again, it actually tastes pretty good, but you know my criteria for beer - cold.
249	I was just giving you a hard time about the name, that is reason #4761 why it is good to be a man.
249	Ashley did the same thing with the middle name, that way you keep some of your family.
249	We finally got some cold weather here.
249	I know you guys just got back from a vacation, but were wondering if you might like to join us for a skiing trip to Deer Valley.
249	We are going Jan 6 - 13th.
249	The accomodations are paid for, you would just have lift tickets and airfare.
249	We are staying in a ski in and ski out condo, so we are going to do some grocery shopping and cook.
249	Jason Tidwell and his girlfriend are coming in on the 6th and leaving on the 9th, so if you want to come in half time, that is cool too.
249	Just let us know.
249	Talk to you soon.
250	good luck.
250	I would also suggest having a fire extinguisher handy as well.
250	You can also always say the turkey is a Texas tradition - blackened.
250	Deer Valley is in Utah - 45 minutes outside Salt Lake City.
250	I got airfair from Houston for 200 per person.
250	Have a happy turkey day.
251	I still have two tickets.
251	Let me know soon.
252	I am available.
253	Too late....we had it for dinner last night.
253	Matter of fact, I think I saw the maids packing up the leftovers this morning and heading your way.
253	Enjoy.
254	Would you rather leave early every day and be over there by yourself, or work late a few days with good friends????
254	You tell me.
255	Your brother sold those tickets for me, so sorry, they are gone.
255	Hey, I am meeting them in Atlanta and the Jocks adn Jills sports bar in CNN Center before the game.
255	Please come join us.
255	I will arrive about 11:30 a.m. Talk to you soon.
255	WAR DAMN EAGLE!!
256	They are pretty well known here and are pretty expensive.
256	Their store is in a very nice area of houston.
256	Should be ok.
257	No, we go January 6-13th.
257	I can not wait.
257	It has been two years since we have gone.
258	So am I. I heard through the grapevine that we will be heading out to Ditka's for your birthday on Thursday?
258	I also heard rumors that they may be closing that casino down.
258	I hope it is not before Jazz Fest.
259	I would definitely enjoy playing black jack with you till 5 in the morning again.
260	That will be the first thing when we sit down - here is the card and bring on the beer winch.
261	I will definitely pack my beanbag just in case.
261	Since you are the only one willing to go with me to secure a good space, we will need something to pass the time besides beer.
262	Hey what time were you meeting us up at Jock's and Jill's tomorrow?
262	Your brother said you won't be in till around 3 p.m.
262	You need to get there earlier than that if I am going to buy you a beer.
263	WHat time are you coming to Jock's & Jill's tomorrow?
263	I will be there around 11 a.m. Are you doing anything tomorrow night?
263	I hear the Gold club calling.
263	I am staying at the Holiday Inn at the Airport.
263	There is also a big boxing match tomorrow night - Vargas and Trinidad - should be a dandy.
264	sounds good.
265	Matt Stover, K Bal - $26
266	This deal is booked correctly.
266	The external fee, labeled exchange fee is the .145 cents per mm that we owe them for the exchange.
266	The confirmation letter is wrong.
266	The fee per Geoff Storey the trader is .145.
266	This is also known as a spread fee.
266	If you have any questions, please feel free to call 3-7376.
267	I like that.
268	Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn Menear.
268	THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.
268	THe product type is US GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.
268	This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.
268	Robyn sets this curve everyday as a basis curve.
268	Thanks.
268	If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to shout.
269	Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you.
269	Work has been real hectic.
269	Trust me, I feel old as well.
269	The old body doesn't cooperate like it use to.
269	Jackson and Ashley are doing great.
269	We got our tree up and he just rounds around pointing at the glass balls on the tree and yelling balls!!!!
269	This christmas should be fun.
269	When are you coming out here to visit?
270	Hey man, our new address is: 4435 Sterling Wood Way
271	Glad to hear this.
271	read the whole story, hopefully it is true.
272	I will be there.
273	I do not mind us bringing JAckson.
273	I understand your desire to be with him all the time, but I would like to occasionally do something with our friends for a vacation that is just us.
273	I think in time you will become more comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.
273	You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.
273	If we go we need to make plans for barkley.
273	Bundle Jackson up this morning it is near freezing.
273	Please cover the plants out back.
273	Thanks.
274	I want to play on the motley side.
274	I am off work the next day, so I will try and make it.
275	The trees in the bed should be fine.
275	Just the azaleas and the garlic.
276	Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas cards.
276	How is married life treating you?
276	Good I hope.
276	What are you guys doing for Christmas?
276	Are your folks coming in?
276	We are staying in Houston.
276	Should be nice and quiet.
276	We are going to have a few people over for new year's, but nothing special.
277	That is what I had for your address, just checking.
277	We had a blast with your uncles as well.
277	We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.
277	I guess we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at the wedding.
277	I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.
277	I guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.
277	Since I have a small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have special friends that you consider family.
277	Plus, you know how special you have always been and will be to me.
277	Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.
277	Sad to hear you are working my kind of hours now.
277	Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but counting the days till my rotation to a new group.
277	Talk to you soon.
278	simmer down missy....
279	I just don't want you getting me worked up when there is nothing I can do about it now.
280	I had a little bird put a word in my ear.
280	Is there any possibility for Ben Raimer to be Bush's secretary of HHS?
280	Just curious about that infamous UTMB rumor mill.
280	Hope things are well, happy holidays.
281	FYI - I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and booked to GD - Central.
281	This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were incurred related to this orig.
281	Per Misti, this amount will come through in November and needs to be reclassed to July August adn September.
281	Cathy has the correct amounts on her back pages.
281	Please shout with any questions.
282	sounds good.
282	We will have to start getting firm replies from people soon.
282	Is the full amount still due on Feb. 15th?
282	If so, people will have to give us their money by then.
283	Sounds good to me.
283	Make me a plate, remember I have a 9 basketball game, so I will be home about 10:30.
284	I will be on vacation but will be there the next week.
285	Here are the P&L file and positions.

288	We will have to hook up.
288	Rachel Bonilla and her husband are going to be there as well that weekend.
288	Should be fun.
289	Aren't you LSU boys starting your usual shit talking a little early this year?
289	When you can finally beat my school in football then I will start listening to your BS.
289	FYI, those guys leaving has been helping our recruiting.
290	maybe you guys can finally beat us now that we have so many guys going to the pros.
290	What the hell is Booty thinking?
290	Any one that drafts him has got to be a fool.
290	I guess he saw the writing on the wall that Rohan would be getting the PT.
291	I just got back in the office from a week off, so I am catching up this morning.
291	I will unfortunately be unable to attend your meeting this morning.
291	I need to try and get prepared for the afternoon meeting.
291	Thanks.
292	Sounds great.
292	We will have to meet up somewhere.
292	We are staying at the NY,NY under my name.
292	I feel the same.
292	I really enjoy seeing you, but as usual, the visits are too short.
292	We will just have to make more frequent trips to Denver.
292	I will write more later, trying to get caught up from a week off.
292	Jackson did get the gift for Christmas from you, the thank you card should be in the mail.
292	Thanks.
293	Ya nknow, every year it is the same thing with you guys....we are going to dominate....we are the best.
293	The problem is you never deliver.
294	Congratulations.
294	I thought you said you were done after one?
294	I am sure your son will absolutely love having someone to play with.
294	I just got back from a week off, so I am swamped.
294	I am now the business controller for our desk, so I have reviews and a million other things to catch up on.
294	We will have to chat later.
295	I was out of town this past week and did not get back until Saturday night.
295	Sorry I missed your call.
295	What was the outcome on the game saturday?
295	I will try and make it to practice tonight.
295	I have a new job at Enron that keeps me here most night until 8 p.m.
295	or so.
296	Attached are the files you requested from the central desk.
296	Please add my name to your email list for P&L requests.
296	I am now the lead for the Central desk.
296	Thanks.
296	If you have any further questions, please feel free to give me a shout.
297	Who in the hell is getting married in Cabo?
297	That sure is different.
297	You will have to go to Jazz fest with us next year.
297	Just let me know.
297	We reserve the extra rooms around Jan. and have to pay for them by Feb. 15th.
297	How is your new job going?
297	I am staying too damn busy here, Darron got me in all kinds of trouble.
297	See you in Vegas.
298	Darron talked the higher ups here into making me the business controller for the Central desk.
298	So now my hours are longer and responsibility greater all for the same pay.
298	I guess I did n't have to do the stupid thing and accept, but oh well.
298	We will see if I can handle another year in risk.
298	Talk to you soon.
299	Looks correct to me Dawnie.
300	Please add my name to this email if you continue to send this file out.
300	Thanks.
301	You are right about one thing....it seems there is never a time when we are not busy here..
301	With the job change, my work schedule just got worse.
301	Sorry if I sounded wierd, did not mean too, I am sure it was just htat I was in a hurry.
301	Talk to you soon.
302	Thanks for the good words, hope to see you in Vegas.
302	Stay out of trouble.
303	Not so fast buddy.
303	Check out this article.
304	Jim, Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.
304	This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.
304	The Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.
304	Please shout with any questions.
304	Jennifer, this should eliminate the current outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have been cleaned up.
304	The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.
304	I believe the variances will be a gain.
304	Thanks for you help guys.
305	Please send me more information on book G5.
305	The person that runs that book, FTOC, is not aware of this book.
305	Please send me the book name and we will try and track it down.
305	FYI, please send all future Central desk/Ontario desk inquires to me.
305	Kam has moved to the East desk and I am now the lead for the Central.
305	Thanks for your help.
306	I have not seen the increased volumes.
306	I will ask andy tomorrow about them.
306	The original 13K and 30 K are in Sitara.
307	I just wanted to update you guys on the status of the EMW reports for Hunter.
307	The EMW Positions_1 file is now updated and accurate.
307	Every night when Kevin finishes his P&L file and updates the EMW Positions file, he will email the entire central team.
307	If one of us is still here, we can print out the necessary reports and leave them on Hunter's desk.
307	If no one is here, the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to Hunter with the Var report.
307	For the time being Hunter will be the only one needing these reports, I will communicate any change in distribution that he requests.
307	Also for the time being, we will be going into Kevin's P&L file, which is in the same location as our intra month P&L's that we sign off on, and printing the four tabs that he has identified in the email attached.
307	When Hunter has time to review this format with me, we may make changes to the reports we print out.
307	The EMW positions_1 file is in the same location as our CE Positions_1 file.
307	Please as always, shout with any questions or concerns.
307	Thanks for your help.
308	Please add me to this list.
308	I am replacing Kam on the Central desk, she is moving to the east desk.
309	FYI.
310	sounds like a great plan.
310	Talk to you more about it tonight.
311	I already have access.
312	I have a few concerns about this.
312	We are suppossed to be the only point of contact for changes in tagg.
312	This is an internal control issue that leaves all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.
312	If other people are touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further and thus take longer to resolve.
312	I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current system?
312	Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?
312	If so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.
312	Please let me know if the others disagree with me.
312	Thanks.
313	Here was my original response to her.
313	Joe Hunter is fine with me.
314	Here are a list of TAGG3's that were already linked: If you have any questions are need help with this, please let me know.
314	Thanks for your help.
315	That is all fine with me.
315	Just ask mom what she wants to do.
315	She will not flip out again, I think.
315	We can see if she wants to do anything on his actual birthday.
315	What are we going to actually do after the Gymboree thing, are we inviting anyone else over?
316	I forgot to tell you last night, Ginger called and said Tori will be there.
316	I thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well.
316	What about just going out to eat at Lupe's with your mom and nonnie?
316	That sounds good to me.
316	We do not have to have a party with Brian/Rebecca, Kim and Ev and then they feel obligated to bring a gift.
316	No big deal to me and I am sure no big deal to them.
316	What are we doing for dinner tonight?
317	What are you doing home in the middle of the day?
318	I did not see the two sitara numbers on the email.
318	Please send me the numbers and I will change them now.
318	Thanks.
319	These two deals, 249262 & 565833 are changed for February out.
319	I will tell the risk team that all new deals at NGPL/Nipsco should be at NIPS/NGPL - 9260.
319	Is this correct?
320	FYI, all new deals that are at NGPL/Nipsco, need to be in sitara at Nipsco/NGPL.
320	Please shout with any questions.
321	Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.
321	I believe they are as follows: gas daily should be GDP-CHI.
321	GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI.
321	GATE, and the Mid should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.
321	Please shout with any questions.
321	Thanks for your help.
322	Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central 1 & Central 2.
322	The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.
322	I highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.
322	I then attached those days P&L top sheets.
322	Please review this information and let us know what type of detailed support you will need.
322	Thanks.
323	guess it helps to attach the file.
324	I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.
324	Rahil Jafry referred me to you.
324	I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.
324	Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for tomorrow's gas flow.
324	I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, who then sent me to you.
324	Is this possible?
324	Please feel free to contact me for any additional information or if this is really confusing.
324	Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will start over with EOL.
324	Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
324	Phillip
325	Thanks for your help.
325	This sounds like a good fit for us.
325	The only issues I have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve file.
325	The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m.
325	everyday(prices for the next gas day).
325	Thanks so much for your help.
326	I suggest not watching this after eating or drinking too much.
327	This deal is ok for now because it only has a volume in for January.
327	If the trader changes the volume for the out months, we will need to have it in tagg.
327	thanks.
328	Good to see.
328	Thanks for forwarding.
329	Please add Victor Guggenheim to your list.
329	Thanks for the email.

335	Thanks.
335	P.S.
335	Thanks in advance for all of your help for me today and tomorrow.
336	I have also been meaning to email you.
336	Unfortunately, I do not have much time to talk with you, I have to head out to alabama unexpectedly, my gradfather is pretty ill.
336	We were wondering if you guys might want to go to Jazz fest.
336	THe dates are 4/226-4/30(thurs. arrival, monday departure).
336	We have about 5 couples going right now and the room rate is $440 per couple for all four nights total.
336	Let me know if you are interested, we have to have the rooms paid for by 2/15/01.
336	Talk to you soon.
336	Thanks.
337	Thanks.
337	I think we have everything covered.
337	We are taking Jackson, I believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.
337	If you guys want to bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other kids his age to play with.
337	Talk to you next week.
338	Thanks for the invite.
338	Unfortunately, I have to go out of town tonight unexpectedly.
338	Have fun.
339	looks good to me.(steve talked to me about him).
340	Thanks VIc.
341	FYI.
342	Sounds good to me.
342	We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.
342	We look forward to seeing you in April.
342	My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the funeral on Saturday.
342	I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.
342	I bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my emotions.
342	I hope I never have to do that again.
342	Thanks for your thoughts.
342	I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.
342	Wild huh?
342	Talk to you soon.
343	Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back with you, I had to leave town unexpectedly and just returned today.
343	All of that sounds great, how about putting the file in the O drive under erms/1intra/central.
343	Please name the file EOL curves.
343	Please let me know if you have any problems.
343	Thanks for your help on this matter.
344	using the wrong head I think.
344	According to the official Jazz Fest website, there are only 87 days till Fest 2001.
344	Harrah's!!
344	Harrah's!!
344	Harrah's!!
345	Thanks for your wishes and I am confident all your prayers helped me get through the weekend.
345	Thanks again for your kind words.
346	Has then been fixed yet?
346	Thanks for the Jesse joke, pretty funny.
347	Will you cehck this out and see if it is for real?
347	Also, did you talk to the day care about watchmegrow.com?
348	have you heard anything from Jim on these?
348	How are we looking on back pages?
348	Let me know and I can take some time with you to help and clean them up further.
348	Thanks.
349	The room is $440 per couple for the four nights or $220 per person.
349	The fest tickets are $15 a day and people usually go 2 of the three days.
349	there is also a Harrah's casino across the street from our condo.
349	The condo's have kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly.
349	We go every year and have a blast.
349	If you are interested let me know.
350	Can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount (numbers at the bottom of your schedule) for Ontario thru 0008.
350	It appears that the number will be roughly 25K in income, making the number 255K unexplained and that will be for the months 0009-0011.
350	Can we also do the same on Central through 0006, this will be roughly 56K in expenses.
350	This will clean up that as well.
350	Please shout if there are any problems.
350	Thanks.
351	We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.
351	Would you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines on other desks.
351	For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.
351	This would simply be an additional step to verify all deals are being captured.
351	Hopefully this will eliminate any future problems.
351	If you have any suggestions for ways to better handle this, please let me know.
351	Thanks.
352	FYI, I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind.
352	So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new deal problems.
352	Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and new deals should be tied out before calcing.
352	I know you guys almost always do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be watching us even closer now.
352	Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra month trader.
352	I also heard this request from Hunter.
352	Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work.
353	I agree with that totally.
353	Jeff should we get a meeting set up with LaGrasta to discuss this with him.
353	Please let me know your thoughts.
354	FYI, a note from the top.
354	If you need help, let me know.
355	check this out...next time check your sources.
356	thanks for your help.
357	this is the kid from opelika correct?
357	I heard when he committed last week, all the publications took him from a 5 star to four star.
357	SOunds like a little biased alabama propaganda.
357	I talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in PaPa's name.
357	He was telling me to call him anytime I am down there and he will get us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center.
357	Sounds like a lot of fun.
357	Let me know if you are interested during football season.
358	Here is an article for all you LSU boys who kept saying Tuberville was leaving.
359	You should enjoy this article.
360	once again, keep your mouth shut til you beat my team.
360	You have not proved anything yet.
361	your so poetic, please continue to share with me your true feelings, it only increases my opinion of LSU alums.
362	can you provide me with a deal number to check into this matter?
363	I have a favor to ask.
363	Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.
363	We had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge.
363	The point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it.
363	The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.
363	If the locations are different, it will value the deal at the customer price.
363	This could potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.
363	It does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints.
363	We will be more than happy to make the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books.
363	I would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass.
363	If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.
363	Thanks.
364	I have no knowledge of the change, it does not affect me.
364	Sorry I am unable to help.
365	Your just pissed because I was right about that recruit all along.
366	You might try Kathy Kelly.
367	FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does not effect the value.
367	Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the value.
367	Thanks again.
368	touchy,touchy.
368	seems like the frustration of three straight top 5 recruiting classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you.
368	It will be ok.
368	Hopefully Mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of persuasion.
369	Chad, do you even know what is coming out of your mouth?
369	When did you become such a football expert?
369	I recall Blanchard and the boys having to teach you about the game.
370	Please do not try and compare Louisiana to Alabama.
370	There is only one university in Louisiana.
370	You can not hold it against Auburn that Napoleonville has only been able to support one university.
370	Tulane is strictly academics and we are talking sports.
371	I responded, I just did not copy anyone.
372	Did you not hear me.
372	I said I was talking athletics.
372	Do you want me to break out academics with you?
372	I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn.
372	Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.
372	Behind the service academies, more astronauts than any other university.
372	Top ten among universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.
372	The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.
372	Just because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior academically.
372	I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or Auburn, in terms of academic stature.
372	You should know that recruiting at Enron has and will always be political.
372	You have to have someone from that school in upper managment request trips be made.
372	I can promise you in the next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.
372	I and anothe alum have already discussed it with HR.
373	This should have been cc to you.
373	I think development made a mistake and cc
374	Tell you what Chad, you win.
374	I really am tired of banging my head against a wall talking to an irrational person.
374	I was not trying to make fun of your school, you chose that route.
374	I was trying to make a simple point that recruiting at Enron does not make a school elite.
374	Does NASA recruit at LSU?
374	Does IBM?
374	Who cares?
374	The point once again, we were talking about SPORTS!!!!
374	See you in Baton Rouge in September.
374	Go ahead and respond, so that way you have the "last word".
375	I deleted the file.
376	Do you have an updated status on this issue?
376	Thanks.
377	check this out.
377	Hopefully he will qualify.
378	Let's hope he qualifies.
378	That could be a game breaker.
379	After meeting with Larry Joe Hunter, we will not be granting tagg access to his group.
379	They were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the wrong counterparty.
379	The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.
379	This is not an option.
379	Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.
379	We must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty initially.
379	Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line.
379	If we do not have all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.
379	FYI, this is going to be a highly visible area for us to make mistakes.
379	If we continue to make these mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.
379	To help us do this correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list on a monthlly basis.
379	We will still have emails sent denoting CP name changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future reference.
379	If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, please call Bianca Ornelas at 5-3782.
379	If you have any questions, please give me a shout.
379	Thanks.
380	I have no seat for him until Feb 15th when Palmer leaves.
380	I will see what I can find out in terms of Kam moving.

382	FYI, I got a message from Elizabeth Hernanadez that we are missing a few of these sitara numbers in tagg when we are booking deals.
382	She fixed the ones we missed yesterday.
382	Please put these numbers in because it is vital to resolving OA variances that we are able to tie tagg deals to sitara.
383	Thank you.
383	It means alot to have friends that are always willing to help.
383	Everything gets better with time and I am definitely doing better this week.

384	Elizabeth Soto actually was able to get me the tickets I needed.
384	I was trying to cover the bases.

384	Good I hope.
385	Thanks for the thoughts.
385	Sorry it has taken me a few days, work has been really crazy.

385	How do you like it?

386	Burgess.
386	Mail the check to Auburn University c/o Sam Hendrix, Director of Development Vet.
386	School 317 South College Street Auburn University, AL 36849 Thanks so much for your kindness, support and generosity.
387	Please verify that all of these deals in your books have been flipped out.
387	We should not have many.
387	Shout with any questions.
388	thanks for the update.
389	here are my changes, highlighted in yellow.
390	did this ever get resolved?
391	Jim, would you mind setting up a meeting with the appropriate people so that we can get this resolved, I was assured by Misti Day the first week of December that this would be fixed.
391	Thanks for your help.
392	FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about unofficialized post id's.
392	We run a macro every night to verify these are officialized.
392	I just want to remind everyone that this is very important that we do this.
392	Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these errors continue.
392	Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on this currently.
392	Thanks.
393	All of central books are done.
393	If you are missing any econ details, please let me know.
394	FYI
395	FYI, make sure the tab on your P&L file has been changed to match this email.

395	Thanks.
396	Where did you go fishing, offshore?
396	Who all went with you?
396	This company that you work for...is it named after your old girlfriend?
397	Sounds like fun man.
397	Do you ever do any bay fishing?
397	If you want to, let me know and I would love to go.
397	I like to wade fish so that I can use my fly rod.
397	I need to get my licensed renewed.
397	How much did you catch?
398	this is really funny.
399	Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 1.
399	Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2.
399	Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
399	2.
399	Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices.
399	3.
399	We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).
399	A financial annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
399	4.
399	The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).
399	These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below.
399	If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 3-7376.
399	Thanks.
399	Enron North America Corp.
400	FYI, you may see some January/February OA variances on Sithe due to these tagg numbers.
400	The sitara deal number involved is 543246.
400	Shout with any questions.
401	Please set up the two books attached.
401	Shout with any questions.
401	Thanks.
402	that is ok.
402	Thanks for the update.
403	looks good to me.
404	you know i am always in need of some male bonding.
404	You guys decide if you want to go to Jazz Fest?
404	Do not forget about my mom's offer relating to said event.
404	Talk to you soon.
405	sorry I forgot to reply.
405	I was at the gym for the first time in 3 years.
405	I really needed the workout.
405	I will be there next week.
405	Thanks.
406	EY3999.E is a northeast deal.
406	If you look in teh liquidation file under peoples sales, you will see this liquidation.
406	The point in tagg is a northeast point, so they will have the sitara number, the contact for you should be Kam Keiser.
407	Sitara #119378 is for all three N17872 legs and EY4000.2 is sitara #115203.
407	THe remaining liquidation EY4008.2 should be a liq no flow.
407	The deal was killed.
408	I got this from elizabeth.
408	IF you really want to change the date let me know, it is scheduled for next Friday.
408	When the move occurs, we can take the PC on palmer's new desk and move it to mick's old desk.
408	I will move that.
409	he is taking his.
409	There is a pc on the desk next to kam already.
410	Brian McKnight isn't too bad either.
410	Although, overall, I was nto that impressed with the schedule this year for either weekend.
410	I wil however still have the best weekend of the year.
411	Thanks for your prompt assistance with these books.
412	These deals are not even on my desk.
412	All but the physical forward belong to the Price Desk.
412	the physical foward is a Texas desk deal.
412	You should contact the leads of those two risk groups - Errol McLaughlin and Dave Baumbach respectively.
412	Sorry I can't help.
413	Remove Scott Palmer from the list attached effective 2/15/01 and add Anna Kulic starting tomorrow.
414	FYI.
414	We are under the mandate...no more screw ups.
415	My groups survey should be there for January, I just finished.
415	Please let me know if you need any more information.
415	Thanks.
416	I think I have 35,000 continental miles also.
416	I think that it is only 20,000 for a free flight.
416	You decide.
417	Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.
417	All of the sub books associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and GD.
417	The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.
417	If you need any further information, please feel free to give me a shout.
417	Thanks for your help.
418	Let me know if you have to change any of these.
419	I would say track it down with volume mgmt.
419	As far as I can tell, this deal ended 12/31/00.
420	A Texas grad I work with found this on one of his alum sites.
420	The guy that put this out - Flea- is the auburn guy who runs thetigeronline.com.
420	Pretty funny.
421	Not too late, I have to pay for the rooms a week from today.
421	Hurry, hurry, Talk to you soon.
422	Please email me with requests for central deals.
422	Thanks.
423	Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our traders notebooks.
423	Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.
423	It is very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not always remind us that they did a deal late.
423	I spoke with hunter this morning and he wants these mistakes to stop.
423	This doesn't happen often, put it is very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.
423	Thanks for your help.
424	Please do this asap for your books.
424	I will check victor's books.
424	Thanks.
425	Here is FT-Ontario's value for Co Energy.
425	Storey only had basis and index deals with them.
425	Please let me know if this format is not good for you.
426	I did see that, I think they have him in a JC in Kansas.
426	Hopefully we will get him in two years.
427	Fax me the contract so that I can share this info with the trader.
427	713-646-2496.
427	Thanks.
428	The weekend is April 27th thru the 30th(arrive thur night and return monday a.m., four night minimum).
428	We have four rooms total, two are completely booked and 1 couple is in the 3rd room.
428	Each room sleeps 3 couples.
428	just let me know, we would love to have you guys.
428	Room is $440 per couple for the entire weekend.
429	Please mad GRLK/St.
429	Clair to the same curve that TCPL/St.
429	Clair GL is mapped, CGPR-St.
429	Clair.
429	Thanks for your help.
430	works for me.
431	FYI
432	I just went to look at the file and the data is yesterday's data.
432	We need the current prices that are set each day at roughly 12:10 for the gas day of the next day.
432	Please let me know if this does not make sense.
432	Thanks.
433	I have to say, I would be offended by that prayer too.
433	FYI, I will be in town this weekend(Haleyville).
433	We are packing up PaPa's stuff on Saturday if you want to come by and hang out.
433	Mom and I are probably going to head out Saturday afternoon.
433	Just a thought.
434	looks like he has taken the picture down.
434	It sure was funny.
435	Hey girl, you guys figure out about Jazz Fest yet?
435	We have to pay for the rooms tomorrow.
435	I need to know ASAP.
435	Hope everything is going good.
436	FYI, I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the central desk for december 2000.
436	It appears deals that are gas daily priced deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.
436	Two gas daily publications came out at the end of the year.
436	The publication on the 29th was for trans.
436	dated the 28th and flowing the 29th.
436	The next gas daily publication came out on the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans.
436	29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.
436	We flashed gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 2nd.
436	This is correct, we should pay sat.
436	and sunday based on Monday's price.
436	Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.
436	I am going to give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.
436	If you disagree with my logic, please give me a shout.
436	Thanks.
437	I got an update from Bryce.
437	In the back of the publication for 1/2/01(page 7), there are prices for the 30th & 31st.
437	It appears the 30th & 31st got pub posted at the first page of the 1/2/01 publication.
437	Therefore, we are going to see OA on these deals.
438	FYI guys.
438	Save this stuff for after hours.
439	You can ask fabiola.
439	We are not in a bind we are still waiting on a few people to get back with us.
439	I think ashley was calling Monica and Jaime to see if they were interested and Ricky and Tanya.
439	The only bad thing is they have to let us know tomorrow if they are interested.
439	Sorry you are unable to make it, maybe next year.
440	Here is my groups book administrators.
440	If you need any further information, please let me know.
440	Thanks.
441	No new deals for central desk since bid week.
442	Today's file looks good.
442	Thanks for your help.
443	that is fine with me.
443	He said however that he will have an answer for me this morning.
443	If he leaves we should definitely cancel.
444	FYI, Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.
444	The reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.
444	What typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes to the desk entirely at mid.
444	This is causing some substantial OA variances.
444	If you have any questions, please let me know.
444	Thanks.
445	As is the case will all FT-Ontario deals done at a US point, the deal must flow physically from a US book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long term income/loss from the deal.
445	This is a commercial decision that risk has to abide by.
445	The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat performances.
445	This deal in question began in 11/00 and since you are doing december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.
445	I suggest forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.
445	Thanks.
446	Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a financial liquidation problem from 0007.
446	I have a deal NR2989.1 that is showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production month.
446	When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to NG-Price.
446	I do not believe this should be in the central region.
446	Any assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had yesterday regarding financial liquidations.
446	Thanks for your help guys.
446	Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin.
446	liq.
447	Attached is the fred file.
447	On the recon variances tab, please note the liquidations coded in puke green, bright pink, blood red and blue.
447	These items will resolve our variance within 60K.
447	We will take the 60K expense.
447	Please try and resolve those issues before close of 0201.
447	Let me know if you get resistance or need help.
447	Thanks.
448	helps is I attach the damn thing.
449	Attached is the revised 0006 FRED please transfer the EMW items to the EMW line and settlements will have to resolve these issues.
449	Thanks.
450	The feeling is mutual.
450	Things are going good, even better if I could get out of here at a decent time.
450	At least I don't have Susan's hours.
450	Are you coming to her happy hour tonight?
450	Talk to you soon.
450	Enron North America Corp.
451	We need to keep this for Jackson.
452	looks like my boy.
453	We will also take the interdesk variance for 0011 - $123K
454	Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for $265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage.
454	The terms match and we should have no variance.
454	Please ask Gas accounting why we do not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.
454	Thanks.
455	0011 Lone liquidation variances: CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in forms and we should have used these to clear.
455	ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.
455	The gas that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern Natural.
455	This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements.
455	Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara #456560, again, no variance to the desk.
455	Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to the desk.
455	Let me know if you need further info on this category.
456	0010 Lone Liquidations: Phillips N45554.3 is a take to the desk, deal was killed in sitara PGL&C should be transferred to the Peoples desk - tagg has the book as Take remaining variance.
457	0009 Lone Liquidations: NU2698.2 is an EMW liquidation and goes with Sitara #359527, tsf this to the EMW line should clear both variances.
457	We need to take the Phillip's liquidation just like 0010 - deal killed Desk will also take the remaining $1,500 variance
458	0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora liquidation tsf from the East Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn storage?
458	WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara #384296 12/00-2/01.
458	This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 $105,000.
458	We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this liquidation will offset.
458	Take remaining $7K Thanks.
459	Take the variance for 0006 lone liq - $31K
460	The desk will take the lone liquidations for 0007 - $130K
461	I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a variance in 0008.
461	If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the GL.
461	The counterparties in both are the same.
461	Jim needs to revise 0001 file.
461	Shout with any questions.
461	Thanks.
462	take the cilco 44K from 0003
463	Check this out.
463	Can you get in touch with Fab.
464	FYI.
465	Thanks again for your help this weekend.
465	I enjoyed hanging out with you.
466	Looks good to me.
466	- I noticed a note on an ECC purchase - Q29840 - sitara killed, the wrong sitara number is on that tagg - the correct number is 430538.
466	I made the change in tagg.
466	The transcanada liquidation that are not highlighted are the exchange deals that are not showing up in the GL.
466	This is the huge problem that seems to not ever get resolved.
467	To me, this looks to be a sign problem in the FRED model.
467	The variance in all cases is exactly double the flashed amount.
467	Jim please verify if this is correct.
467	Thanks.
468	Sorry guys, this slipped my mind today, will you please email Joe hunter this information today before you calc.
468	Thanks.
469	I am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with.
469	I need to still meet with Souad for this month and need to get with Anna and go over the information that I have given her.
469	One thing that seems to have come up several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions.
469	Some topics that have come up are OA and curve mapping.
469	I have talked with Kam about this and we are going to try and put something together.
470	Please replace your physical tabs in your P&L to the file format attachedbelow.
470	This should eliminate interdesk variances.
470	You will need to add thMTM information and any transport/flash to actual items that you currentlymay have on your physical tab.
470	I would suggest doing this tomorrow morningwhen you roll your P&L.
470	Shout with any questions.
470	Thanks.
471	3 is a good time, please add Darron Giron, Dave Baumbach and Kam Keiser.
471	Thanks for your help.
472	Thursday is great.
473	Use this file instead.
474	can you please get this right.
475	This should be the final and correct version.
475	Hopefully Mausser got it right this time.
476	The issue of respect can be addressed in one simple two word phrase - DRAFT DODGER!!
477	Just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in Houston inactivate the spot contract we have with Sunoco Inc so that anyone that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place or get this one reactivated.
477	This difficulty should send up a red flag and keep deals from flowing with this counterparty.
477	Please let me know if you need any further information.
477	Thanks.
478	We will take this variance to the desk then.
479	We will take the DPR/Consolidated flash variance of 259K expense.
479	Thanks
480	I will attend.
481	Per reconciliation with TAGG, I have changed this price to be IF/NNG/VENT - .03.
481	If you have any more questions, please let me know.
481	Please let me know what the increased invoice amount was for 11/00 & 12/00.
481	Thanks.
482	thanks for the info.
483	We will take the variance on Central back page for approx.
483	$791K for prior month book balance in 1100.
483	1100 was the first month that we switched the central transport flash from GD central to Intra Ontario so we flashed it incorrectly.
483	Thanks.
484	I think Ashley sent Fab some info on the fest.
484	We have had to lock into the rooms last week, so I do not know if we will be able to help her get a room unless they still have some available when she makes a decision.
484	Sorry to hear about your work life stinking.
484	I definitely know the feeling.
484	The way I rationalize it is that I will take a job that has better hours before Jackson gets into school.
484	On a happier note, we are going to dinner with your parents this weekend.
484	Should be fun.
484	Talk to you soon - don't work too hard.
485	Aurora N65007.2 0008 lone liquidation belongs to sitara #307241.
485	We should have had a form on this.
485	The deal came to the desk at mid and would require a liquidation.
485	You should have a variance on your compare reports.
485	If not, please have settlements get you a copy of the invoice for 0008 and we will do a form.
485	Thanks.
486	We will take the NGPL variances.
487	We can take the 265k if you find that we already took the existing variances.
488	yes goofy.
488	Already taken care of.
489	All of our documentation says 4.78.
489	If they want to pay us a penny more, I will take it.
489	I changed the price for January.
489	If this same problem arises again in Feb, let me know.
489	I am curious why they agreed with 4.78 for
490	Please take the variances through 0009 to the desk.
490	Thanks.
491	we will take the aurora 310K variance - looks like the deal was flipped out
492	We will take the MTM variance for 0010 - 441K - this is partially offset by Central's variance.
492	This is related due to the changing fo the transport book from GD-Central to Intra-Ontario.
493	Ontario: Can you give me the details on the interdesk purchase variance $346K fir 0010.
493	i.e. what desk the variance is with.
493	We will take the MtM prior month book balance variance of 1MM.
493	Do you know which counterparties make up the CPR variance for 0011?
493	Thanks.
494	Ontario 0011 synthetic storage: QA1354.2 is offset by QA1354.4 - this apears to be missing from this line.
494	QA1354.5 is offset by QA1354.6 - also missing from this line.
494	What are the last two numbers for this line (2,032,081) & 166,921 - these are note in the notes.
494	Thanks.
495	The tickets for HOB will go on sale around next wednesday.
495	I will call and get them.
495	I am starting to get pumped as well.
495	Luckily I have a trip to Vegas in March that will hold me over.
495	I need to find my hand hacky sack so we will have a back up plan.
495	I have a couple of new chairs in a bag for us - full lounge chairs.
495	They even have beer holders in the arms.
496	here is the calc sheet.
496	I have fixed the prices in sitara for all three, redraft.
497	Sorry for losing my cool with you earlier.
497	I have had a difficult few weeks with some people in your group and took some of my frustration with them out on you.
497	Thanks for your help and thanks for not ripping on me too hard.
497	Hope you have a good weekend.
498	the price is fixed.
499	I have corrected the differential pricing(calc sheet prices) for 01/01 & 02/01.
499	You should be able to redraft now.
499	Let me know when you want to discuss the trigger price discrepancies.
499	Thanks.
500	Alright guys, here is the final version, try it in your P&L today.
500	Thanks.
501	This one should hopefully be the final one.
502	All of these deals are yours except the last one.
503	FYI
504	Please give me the locations for the 6th & 8th deals.
504	The deal number in question 613623 - the trader has the deal written up as 5.065.
504	If they dispute this let me know and we will pull tapes.
505	was she concerned at all about Pneumonia or Meningitis?
506	hot damn.
507	The only thing that I can find is Sitara #575092.
507	This is the only August 01 deal we have with them.
507	This volume and price do not match up.
507	Sylvia does not recall the deal they describe and has no paper work for it.
507	ANR Lebanon Ohio does not sound familiar.
507	The only thing that I can think of is that they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.
507	If they can prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.
507	Let me know how I can further assist you.
507	Sorry.
508	I am happy that neither of those two things is a possibility.
509	FYI John- per our conversation about getting all calc sheet deals back.
509	This is the list from settlements and it just so happens all of them are east deals.
510	Kam had told me you were in. We only have three in our room - you, goss and myself.
510	The room will be $200 per person total.
510	You can pay me when we get there or when we leave or send me a check in the mail.
510	I have only paid one night deposit.
510	I get in about 7:45 Vegas time on Wednesday, if you are getting there before me, let me know so that I can get the hotel your name to check in. See you there.
511	we will take all of the amounts in the proposed adjustment categories for Sithe and People's.
511	i still have the people's forms and will be trying to get through them today or tomorrow.
512	I only flashed 41K for sithe, where are you getting the 59K?
512	I have the files for nov in the location you requested.
512	Thanks.
513	FYI - new EOL reports rules.(see below)
514	How the hell did you fall into this one?
515	This type of shit always happens to Crowell.
516	IF- Monchy, according to the trader, the change in the basis curve was due to the fluctuation of the Aeco curve.
516	IF-Monchy is derived from Aeco US.
516	Please shout with any further questions.
516	Thanks.
517	the shit that happens to you is absolutely amazing.
517	Hope you had fun.
517	Are you going to vegas in two weeks?
518	just a little out of my price range.
519	Union is treated as a synthetic storage on Sithe, so we do not keep inventory profit schedules.
519	As far as I can tell you fixed that last month.
519	I will continue to work on Central issues.
519	Thanks.
520	Shout with any more questions.
520	Thanks.
521	None of these remaining books belong to the central desk.
521	Thanks.
522	check the last one.
523	The following is a list of users who need access to EMW calcs: Victor Guggenheim - vguggen Bruce Mills - bmills Phillip Love - plove Thanks for your help.
524	We need access to Price Basis index and gas daily for the following books(I have but the Price Post id to reference): Thanks for your help.
524	We do not need access until Monday morning.
525	Looks like you did it again.
525	When are you going to take me to a cowboy game?
525	Are you going to go to Fla./Georgia in Jacksonville with us this year?
525	Let me know about vegas early next week.
526	Yeah, the question is waht kind of good parties?
527	The picture must be a fake then.
528	We are actually staying at NY,NY.
528	Ceasar's was sold out when I made the reserves last fall and the Mirage was about $100 per person higher.
528	We will leave word where we are in the room.
528	See you next week.
529	For the central desk, please grant view access to the following traders: Geoff Storey Martin Cuilla Kevin Ruscitti Patrice Thurston Jason Williams Tom Donohoe Joe Parks Kelly Stevens Hunter Shively Robin Zivic Andy Lewis Sylvia Pollan Central Risk Team needs update access as well as view access, those members are as follows: Victor Guggenheim Anna Kulic Chuck Ames Bruce Mills Phillip Love Andres Balmaceda I am also attaching samples of the files we will need out there, one position report and one P&L file.
529	Please shout if you need any other information.
529	Thanks for your help.
530	sorry to hear that.
530	I will be sure and gamble enough for the both of us.
531	I sent Shirley all of my stuff on Monday, so she should have samples of the central reports and all user names for access.
532	As far as I am aware, this is an east location, talk with Kam.
533	Sounds cool, I have never met the guy, but hopefully he can help in DC
534	If you look in tagg, the sitara deal number is in the comments section - #372156.
534	If any of you guys want us to come up and show you how to use tagg or what we do to find these numbers, give me a shout.
534	The deal is liquidating in the Ontario book because the Ontario trader did the deal.
534	If that trader does a deal at a US point, the gas has to physically flow out of a US book, not a canadian book.
534	This deal is only for one month, so this will not make Jim Little's recurring list that he automatically transfers for you guys.
534	Let me know if you have any more questions.
534	I also got some message from Souad that you need some help with a People's deal.
534	She thought you said you emailed me on the deal and I do not have an email, let me know if you still need assistance with that issue.
534	Thanks.
535	pretty funny stuff.
535	I think this makes your case stronger to have the rev.
535	Al as your screen saver.
535	He is definitely a higher quality individual.
536	Sam- Here is a little something about my grandfather: Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic Institute, now Auburn University.
536	He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years in Haleyville, Alabama.
536	Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 grandchildren and one great grandchild.
536	Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and tremendous football fan.
536	He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 years.
536	Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.
536	Dr Burgess was a World War II veteran.
536	Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and both grandchildren to school on the plains.
536	Due to his love for Auburn that he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.
536	Dr. Burgess was also a proud member of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.
536	Dr. Burgess was born in Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.
536	Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the things I stated above.
536	Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.
536	Auburn is very fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important school within the University.
536	Talk to you soon.
537	Attn: Ricky 4545 Newburg Road Thanks baby.
538	Slight changes - Make sure of course it is all on one page.
538	Check the spelling of herschel-navy records are in the floor of the office.
538	Should only need 10 copies or so.
538	Have mike and denise sent us the money for the room yet?
538	Tickets to Neville's?
539	Is the 644,650 being tsf from central in 0012 for financial liquidations - have not seen it on the central desk.
539	Thanks.
540	FYI - those of you running firm books.
540	These adjustments described below are due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.
540	In the future, we need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E. Schedule C should be used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other adjustments.
540	Shout with any questions.
541	I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group.
541	Here are the important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt.
541	(championship game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points scored in final game.
541	Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.
541	Here is a link to a bracket.
541	Please forward to anyone you think may be interested.
542	Forgot the payout - 1st place 75%, 2nd place 25%
543	sent to wrong address.
544	I am unable to log in the way you suggested.
544	It is asking for your sportsline password when I hit the link in your email.
544	When I go into sportsline and hit march mayhem, there is no place to enter league name and password like there is when you go into sportsline fantasy.
544	Please provide assistance.
545	Can you take a look at this and let me know what we officialized instead of these.
546	We do not keep inventory schedules on any of the central locations that you mentioned.
546	I am trying to get an inventory balance schedule that logistics keeps for NGPL.
546	I will let you know what I find out and how complete it is.
547	We do not maintain seperate book codes.
548	Would you mind setting up an interview for us with Greg Thomas, resume attached below.
548	I think Dave Baumback, Kam Keiser, Errol McLaughlin, Darron Giron and myself need to interview him.
548	Groups of two at time would be preferred.
548	Thanks.
549	please verify none of these are ours.
550	As Marina and I discussed this morning, accounting requests that we officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them to run reports.
550	We do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons: 1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).
550	If we were to officialize these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.
550	2) All of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third parties.
550	To keep this action from disrupting your group, the risk leads will forward an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request.
550	The following is the list Rachel Crowell in Acctg.
550	asked us to officialize on Please shout with any questions, thanks.
551	don't forget kam.
552	please send this info to Shirley for Darron since he is out.
552	Thanks.
553	IF-NNG TOK is a derived curve.
553	It is based off of IF WAHA TX.
553	That appears to have moved considerably in the last month.
553	Shout with any more questions.
553	Thanks.
554	FYI
555	FYI
556	I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.
556	This relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics yesterday.
556	This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.
556	This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.
556	It appears you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.
556	They are Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain in the butt.
557	Here it is.
557	Thanks.
558	FYI- We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for physical deals.
558	We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.
558	Usually these are less than .05 different.
558	If you have a physical mich physical it should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.
558	Any questions, ask.
558	Thanks.
559	demand charge for #444771.
560	We got them, the guy next to me was collecting and found them, I will send out an email later this morning with the scores.
561	Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.
561	After 4 days in Vegas, please check your scores - I am still in a daze.

565	Thanks for your help.

575	Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.
575	I have attached the revised schedule.
575	Please note the following changes - on the 1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination was granted.
575	We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.
575	The other changes are the second tab.
575	The second tab provides a summary by originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.
575	We will update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value was originated or not.
575	We will then email this schedule to the three of you every time the schedule changes.
575	If you would prefer a hard copy, please let me know.
575	If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please let me know.
575	Thanks.
576	Thanks anyway.
576	I have some information that Darron kept on Cilco, I am still having trouble finding any deals for 98 that can show me we definitely did or did not flash these deals wrong.
576	I am going to keep working on it.
577	Please give me a call when you get a chance to discuss the schedule I sent earlier.
577	Sylvia gave me some information she thought you might want in the schedule.
577	Thanks.
578	sorry for taking so long, it has been a very busy week.
578	Where are you sitting these days?
578	I am still on 32.
578	Talk to you soon.
579	We have made some slight changes to the orig schedule and may make a few more per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.
579	It is vitally important that we do two things with this file now.
579	We must fill in all columns on the first tab - orig schedule and we must put all orig deals in the schedule - even if no orig is granted.
579	THis policy is in effect starting today.
579	Shout with any questions.
580	Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?
580	I figure you spend so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.
580	I have a coworker going up there next month and it is their first time to chicago.
580	I gave them Etta James Place to go on rush and on the south side.
580	Can you think of any other?
580	Thanks.
581	What's up in the hood?
581	It sounds like you guys live in Compton instead of San Diego?
581	Make sure Emma starts packing when she starts kindergarten.
581	If she is strapped, she can shoot back at these SOBs.
581	Yet another reason Texas is better than Cali - we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass.
581	Do you guys want me to order you Jazz Fest tickets when I order ours?
581	I am putting in an order for alot of people because if I mail order them it only costs $3 total as opposed to ticket master's $3 fee per ticket.
581	Since I am ordering ours this way, I can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket price(I eat the $3 because I am doing ours this way anyway).
581	The tickets are $15 through the mail per day as opposed to $20 at the gate and $18 through ticketmaster.
581	Let me know.
581	I am ordering all three days for ashley and I hoping we go all three days.
582	yeah, he finally apologized and it is water under the bridge.
582	We usually have a heated disagreement once a year.
582	Talk to you soon.
583	FYI
584	Thanks again for your help.
584	Everything looks good.
585	FYI, it may be wise to run a few of your macros from Jeff's machine.
585	I would just see if it runs and close without saving.
586	Attached is the updated scores.
586	Please check your scores to verify accuracy.
586	As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.
586	If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.
586	The rest of us are out of it.
586	If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams remaining.
586	By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a charitable deduction for your $10).
587	What is going on man?
587	Any more news on the dilemma we discussed a few weeks ago?
587	Just curios.
587	Hope things are going good for you.
588	We can always count on you to at least give us one on the error report.
589	Happy Birthday old man.
589	I am not sure if my voice mail will make it to you(I got some weird instructions), so I thought I would cover my bases.
589	I have been real busy at work and did not mail your gift until Friday.
589	It will be a few days late - sorry.
589	Hope you enjoyed your bachelor time this weekend.
589	Can't beat peace and quiet.

596	Please grant him access per this request for Sitara.
596	Should you have any questions or need further assistance, please give me a call 3-7376.
597	I have another sitara request for someone that shows as pending to them, but is not on my list to approve.

599	Here is the file from last night.
599	Shout with any questions.
599	Thanks.
600	The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book variance as well on the other side.
600	Portfolio accounting should have a variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will look).
600	This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.
600	I will start looking for dec info you just requested.
601	Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and PGLC/NBPL.
601	The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is GDC-Chi./N/Bord.
601	Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system for these two locations.
601	Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing tonight.
601	Thanks.

605	I think you guys are doing a great job and are very timely in the requests we submit.
605	The only area I see for improvement is better follow up on access requests to the systems.
605	I am very happy with reim requests and general assistance you provide.
605	Thanks.
606	got it.
607	Attached is a file listing all of the curves we had that posted as 0 price for 3/31/01.
607	We need these pub posted as the same price as the 30th - prices are included in this file.
607	We need these pub posted ASAP so that we can flash march detail.
607	Risk does not have authorization to override an existing pub posting, this is why we need your help.
607	If you have any questions, please give me a shout.
607	Thanks for your help.
608	I meant to email you over the weekend to let you know it was on it's way.
608	Just be sure to fill out the matching gifts form.

608	Looks like we will not make it back to Auburn until the fall for football season.

608	Thanks again for your help in completing this special occasion for my family.

609	Thanks again.
610	How are things going?
610	Good I hope.
610	Give me a call when you get a chance I need to see about getting your phone number so that I can have you cut my mom's grass.

652	This deal was put in after the fact - Feb. so, we will have a variance in January that should be offset in February.

657	Hopefully a student from Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.
657	A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H.
657	Burgess has been set up at the school of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.
657	The scholarship has been ear marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he practiced for 35 years.
657	If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you can do so as follows: Auburn University Foundation c/o Sam Hendrix 317 South College Street Auburn University, AL 36849 Please make checks payable to the Auburn University Foundation Any contributions are fully tax deductible Any questions, please contact Dr. Burgess' grandson Phillip Love 281-486-7026 Please feel free to modify this in any way.
657	Thanks for your assistance.
658	FYI - not sure if anyone ahs been putting vacation time in on a time sheet.
658	I got a report and most everyone's was blank.
658	If you believe this to be an error, see me and I will show you the list.
658	I am not calling anyone out for cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.
658	I draw your attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to carry over 40 hrs.
658	Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.
658	I have attached the site for your time sheets.
658	You will need your P# and password to access, contact security if you do not have either.
658	If you need help filling this out, let me know.
658	I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.

659	Here is the most current schedule.
659	Shout with any questions.Thanks.
660	all kidding aside.
660	start sending me email links to job sites or papers in
661	here is your payback.
661	Martin, Bruce's trader-made fun of his haircut last week - woody woodpecker.
661	Steno over here for him and play it.
662	Central, sithe and aruba are there now.
662	sorry.
663	FYI - wanted to let you guys know about a few things: 1.
663	There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - it is a little black date book.
663	Please put any future requests in there so that we can keep track of who needs off when.
663	I would like to try and keep from having more than 3 people out at a time.
663	2.
663	Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.
663	These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly swaps.
663	This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader at gas daily as opposed to mid.
663	This is very important to avoid OA variances.
663	3.
663	When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.
663	This is important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct gd curve.
663	4.
663	I am going to set up a mtg.
663	for friday or monday to discuss OA, the process and how to prepare forms.
663	5.
663	Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.
663	All the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the positions that they do.
663	The only request I have had is that we sit there quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.
663	Please utilize this opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for career development.
663	6.
663	I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your training plans.
663	Please shout with any questions.
664	I am looking at having a party at my house for the group.
664	Let me know asap which date is better for you guys.
664	I want to do it asap before it gets to hot, so we can cook outside.
664	Here are the two dates I have in mind Sat.
664	May 5th(cinco de mayo) or Sat.
664	May 19th.
664	Let me know guys.
664	Thanks.
665	We will have a group class on OA tomorrow around 9:00 am in EB3268.
665	THis is an effort to get you guys up to speed on OA so you can review forms and I can take 3 hour lunches.
665	See you there.
666	not sure if you guys saw this.
666	Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy The Associated Press MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said.
666	When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was essentially fired.
666	"Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract," Muse said.
666	More Auburn football Talkin' Tigers Forum Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose team was off to a 1-5 start.
666	Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel.
666	"That's how David and I worked," Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his Orlando home.
666	"We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be enough (to save his job)."
666	Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15.
666	A transcript of the meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials.
666	Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until "the wee hours of the morning," then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and "urged him to stay until the end of the season."
666	Muse said that was "the most celebrated case" of Lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions, but "there are many others."
666	Bowden often commented that "Mr. Lowder hired me" and that the coach had "regular contact" with the powerful trustee, Muse said.
666	Bowden said he spoke with Lowder "weekly, if not daily" during his first two or three seasons, but "never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I should do it."
666	Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach.
666	He said an eight-member search committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in "Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me hired," said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC.
666	"There's no doubt about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn."
666	Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed.
666	They also denied that Lowder was pulling the strings on that decision.
666	Bowden "always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of Lowder's influence," Muse said.
666	"So he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship."
666	Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator Wayne Hall.
666	Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff Ellis has "very, very frequent contact" with the Montgomery banker.
666	Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment.
666	Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide "support and input" to the president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive accomplishments and "stop bickering."
667	this is the website for signing up for classes.
667	You need to have your user name and password.
667	If you do not have this from the original email, try contacting the development center at x30357
668	screw you.
668	This must have been created by one of your fellow engineers.
668	You guys just have a bad case of penis envy.
668	Ha Ha
669	I wanted to ask a favor.
669	Would you mind reminding your group to please let us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal in sitara.
669	If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically update when you change the physical deal.
669	If the change is simply a meter, that will not effect the pricing of the deal.
669	Thanks for your help.
670	gdp-anr/ok...notice a trend here.
671	Dawn said I need to email you with eol id changes.
671	We have two traders on the central desk who are changing book names effective sunday.
671	Kruscitti needs his log in -ADM96645 moved from Ft-int-cen-mkt to ft-cent.

673	FT-CENT.
673	Thanks.
674	what about some "treatments" at one of those spas?
674	or dinner for two at
675	My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.
675	I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.
675	The forms are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.
676	here it is.
677	Here is the most current orig file.
678	Glenda, Hope everything is going well for you guys.
678	I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for the easter gift you sent Jackson.
678	It was very thoughtful.
678	He has enjoyed coloring the book and everything else he can get his hands on.
678	He also ate all of the chocolate as fast as he could.
678	He is getting really big and really independent.
678	We are headed to Jazz fest this weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.
678	Take care and we will talk to you soon.
678	Thanks again.
678	Love, Jackson, Ashley & Phillip

687	Thanks.
688	All of these deals had their facilities changed by logistics on the last two days.
688	I have reiterated to Lisa Kinsey the importance of her group letting us know when they make a change in facility.
688	All of these were physical basis trades, so they came at contract - the desk price difference is not more than .04 on any of the deals.
688	OA therefore should be minimal.

711	Talk to you soon.
712	thanks.
713	the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 should go with 590922.
713	We will have the same thing in February going the other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 respectively.
713	Shout with any questions.
713	This should explain about 900,000 of the lone liquidation problem from January.
714	same thing with the Reliant energy lone liq from january - QI7044, this is related to sitara #549377.
714	there should be no liq.
714	var.
714	shout with any questions.
715	not interested in paying relocation or travel expenses.
715	We have some good candidates coming in and I am pleased with the resumes you have been sending.
716	here is the most current file.
717	thanks for your help.
717	How are things going?
717	Great I hope.
718	FYI.
719	that operational analysis form you have is mine.
719	If you would drop that in intercompany mail, that would be great.
719	My address is 3264B.
719	Thanks.
720	Please grant me access to the rac website.
720	I am the manager for the central region - natural gas.
720	I need access to activate and inactivate and view all central books.
720	Please give me a call with any questions.
720	Thanks for your help.
721	Sounds like the coast guard found your boat and took your stash.
721	Sorry to hear that.
722	Thanks.
723	thanks so much
724	Interesting take on the state of affairs.
725	thanks.
726	I am sorry to ask for a change on this reservation, but a colleague just mentioned he wanted to get a separate room, so could we have two rooms non smoking with double beds, I realize this may increase the rate.
726	Thanks for all of your help.
727	AC - can you check on this for me please.
727	I am in the chicago office and will not be back until next tuesday.
727	Irena said this was taken care of, you might check with her.
727	Thanks.
728	That's my man.
729	If you want an updated value on the deal, give the ticket numbers that need to be modified/deleted to Bruce and he can get it taken care of.
729	Let me know if you have any questions.
729	Thanks.
730	I have never heard of this location.
730	I only see a basis and index curve for this, no intra month, Storey has this location in his curve file.
730	We have no deals at this location.
730	Does Canada?
730	We do not do the pub posting on Mich_CG-GD, rates does this one.
730	I would think they should post the NGI as well.
731	Bruce Mills x58118.
732	Give Mark a call and get him a copy of the transport model for the central and ontario for 8/31/01.
732	His number is x68680.
732	Thanks
733	FYI - please continue sending this to Robin Rodrigue and change the book admins name to Lynn Pikofsky for the Chicago office(EMW).
733	Kevin Radous is no longer with the company.
733	Thanks.
734	We do not receive this information currently - Jackson Logan forwards the email to us currently.
734	I would appreciate having myself added to the list for email notification.
734	Since there will be an allocation to my cost center, please limit access to this to myself - Bruce Mills does not need access.
734	Please call if you have any questions.
735	sounds good, I heard from Bruce that the booking is not going to well.
735	I don't think it is that complicated, but I will be happy to do it tomorrow.
735	Any luck on getting it into an existing book and not having to calc another book from here on out?
735	Hopefully we can do it tomorrow since it is not going live until 11/01.
735	Talk to you in the morning.
736	work with ed on this and please do this asap.
736	Check the rest of your books as well please.
736	Rember this will be any deal with Transcanada and any other canadian counterparty.
736	Or search in TAGG for your book with ECC as the Enron counterparty - should take 5 minutes.
736	Thanks.
737	did you get to this?
738	separate region.
738	It is within the Mich P&L.
738	Also starting in October, Central transport will no longer be in FT-OC, it will be in Aruba and needs to continue to roll up to Central.
738	Do I need to call you back?
739	Aruba-Sply is an active book, there are just a few deals and there are two with external counterparties.
740	Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.
740	She is a new trader on the central desk.
740	She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.
740	The following books will be her responsibility: Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.
740	Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.
740	Thanks.
741	here is what I said.
742	The only FT-Central-Opt book that should move to her is the GDL.
742	The others should remain with Geoff Storey.
742	She also needs to have the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book.
742	Sorry for the mistake.
743	According to our benchmark guys up here, it looks like the Central Transport GDL book did not make it into risktrac under souad.
743	The book is named FT-Central-opt-gdl.
743	I also should have asked you to send the FT-Peoples-GDI book over to Souad.
743	It appears that the remaining FT-Central-Opt- books (PRC,BAS,IDX) are under Martin Cuilla, these should be under Geoff Storey.
743	Can you please make these changes.
743	Thanks for all of your help.
744	just a status reminder of what is going on: -Please give me a list of your goals and objectives, we will plan on meeting at least once a month and going over those to determine how I can better help you meet those and we can track progress.
744	-We now have a file in the central file in excel entitled project list central desk.
744	there are a list of projects already out there that each of you need to sign up for.
744	This will assist in the PRC process in terms of providing me with examples of things each of you are doing that are contributions to the organization.
744	If you can think of a project that will be an improvement, please add it.
744	If you add a project, put an expected completion date and then put the date it was completed.
744	- We will meet this week or first thing next week to go over the status of each of your "training plans"
745	FYI - Andy and Martin will be giving classes to the trading track guys on the two different locations.
745	They are opening these classes to everyone.
745	I would recommend that you attend, I am going to try and attend as well.
745	THE ONLY CATCH IS THERE WILL BE A TEST AT THE END AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH HUNTER.
745	I think it would look very good if you attend, I only caution you to pay close attention because the two guys have been known to ask tough questions.
746	FYI, I spoke with the erms team about the problem we have with curveview going through runm.
746	If you open runm on your PC instead of a sun machine, you need to open curveview first.
746	If open curveview before any other applications, the screen will be blue and all others will be set up correctly as well.
746	According the Erms guys this is an ancient program and they are unable to fix the logic.
746	Pass this on to your groups.
747	this post id for FT-IM-CENTR-CAD-GDL and it is official.
747	For some reason it is not coming through risktrac.
747	There are no deals in this book.
748	I think you will have to log off.
748	I approved the request.
748	Look at the status of your request and see if it says final approved.
748	If it does than try logging off and trying again.
748	Thanks.
749	I think that the correlations for the points in the Aruba book must be different.
749	Her position is 5 contracts long in the book and her VaR is $500K.
749	Is there any way you can tell me the correlations that are being used for the points that she has positions at in that book?
749	The pub codes are : IF-NNG/VENT, NGI/CHI.
749	GATE, CHI./N/BORDER, NGPL-IOWA0ILLIN,UF-NGPL/OK-NW, NGI/CHI./PEOPLE,NGI/CHI./NIPSCO,ML7/CG.
749	Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.
749	Thanks.
750	thanks for your help.
750	Due to my lack of a complete understanding of VaR, can you give me a lesson if you find out exactly why.
750	All I have ever changed are the correlations.
750	Thanks.
751	I am headed out to lunch at 1 and will be back by 2:30.
751	Is that good?
752	can you check with IT.
752	IT looks like Souad's VaR is still way too high.
752	Thanks.
753	thanks.
754	we will have to take the PMA, it looks like a deal entry error.
755	see the bottom of this email for the locations and mappings.
755	Thanks for your help and let me know if you need any additional information.
756	can you follow up with the Forum group for me.
756	It appears only 3 of my six employees returned the feedback.
756	I have been assured by every member of my team that they sent these in on time.
756	Several members of our class yesterday had the same issue, with one not having any returned.
756	This seems curious enough to investigate.
756	Thanks for your help.
757	thanks.
758	please exit the tagg deal so that I can look at the deal.
759	Jim Simpson has moved from the Chicago office to the Houston office.
759	He will be taking over the Mich-CG book.
759	We need to have the books transferred from Hunter Shively to Jim Simpson.
759	The books are FT-INT-CEN-MKT2-BAS,GDI,GDL,IDX,PRC and INTRA_CNT-MKT2-PHY.
759	Jim should not need to be set up in the system, because he was in Chicago, he should just need books added.
759	Thanks for all of your help.
760	thanks a million
761	Looks like our outing for October 19th for Risk just got cancelled, so are we on for some poker on Thursday the 18th?
761	Who will offer up there house?
762	goss and you can't go now because of some LaGrasta trip on Saturday so looks like we are rescheduling for sometime in December.
763	sorry to keep bothering you.
763	It looks like Souad's VaR continues to go down, but her net positions 5 contracts and her VaR is over $300K.
763	Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.
763	She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi.
763	Gate.
763	I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.
763	Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
763	Thanks.
764	Denver is not my region, you might want to try Anne Bike
765	What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.
765	If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.
765	Let me know what you think.
765	Thanks.
766	sure.
766	I will have it to you in the morning.
767	I got 32C2 for next Wednesday from 1:30 - 2:30.
767	How does that sound?
768	Can you run a component VaR report again for me.
768	We can not figure out where Souad's VaR is coming from.
768	IT fixed the curves and Burton fixed them on his side, the VaR should be virtually nonexistent.
768	I am also noticing a high VaR for Virawan Yawaponsiri, can you also run one on hers please.
768	Sorry to continue to bother you with this, Jeff Gossett just wants this resolved ASAP.
768	Thanks.
769	can you unarchive post id 1280448.
769	Thanks.
770	thanks.
771	Just wanted to follow up and make sure we were still on for tomorrow?
771	Can we make it 12:15 at Chucks BarBQue?
771	I have your numbers and will give you a call if we run into trouble.
771	Thanks.
772	which books in TDS do you need access to?
772	I approved your erequest, but I have to go into TDS and grant the actual access.
772	Thanks.
773	I too am a little worried about the outcome on Saturday.
773	I am bringing two friends that are University of Texas Alums and am just hoping to show them a good time and what true tailgating is all about.
773	There will be including myself 7 adults and my 3 year old son.
773	Is that too many?
773	Please let me know.
773	Everyone is extremely exciting and my son is now to the age that he will really enjoy it.
773	Last year we always took him on game day to see the raptors and he was kind of interested, but now he really enjoys animals.
773	Thanks again for all of your help arranging this trip.
773	Please also let me know again when the scholarship dinner is going to be held, I am sure some of my family would really enjoy attending.
773	Thanks see you at Chuck's.
774	sounds great.
775	Yes it will.
775	This deal is still in the structuring stage.
775	We simply wanted to get the books set up in TAGG and Sitara for if and when this deal goes live.
775	I will keep you posted.
775	I think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called MGU that will have all of these deals on them.
775	I will get with you when I hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations.
775	Thanks.
776	Can you guys map the following curve: EMPRESS-US/IM needs to be mapped to Dawn and Omicron 14.
776	Please shout if you have any questions.
776	Thanks.
777	FYI we will be having a meeting next Wednesday from 1:30 to 2:30 with logistics in 32C2 to go over what risk does and what logistics does.
777	Should be an informative session.
777	Please also remember to email your goals for the next six months so that we can work on making sure you meet those objectives.
777	Thanks.
778	From talking with my guys, I came up with 2 more topics for brown bags - curve mapping and how physical deals flow through the systems
779	works for me or I can do it.
779	I can not do the first one (I vote for Kam)
780	SEE ATTACHMENT FOR CHANGES.
781	Boy did you call it 3 months ago....WE SHOCKED THE WORLD!!!!
781	What a great game.
781	I just wanted to thank you again for the great tour we had on Friday.
781	Everyone talked about it all weekend and we look forward to the expanding projects at the raptor center and hope to be able to help in those efforts.
781	It was great meeting you and I look forward to talking to you again in the future.
781	Thanks again.
782	here it is.
783	Can you please set me up in the XMS system as a manager.
783	One of my employees has a reimbursement that is outstanding and I would like to get it approved as soon as possible.
783	Thanks.
784	Did Bruce get this information to you on Friday?
784	I was out of the office and asked him to respond.
784	Let me know and I can get it for you.
784	Thanks.
785	Kam Keiser suggested I call you to help with a request I received from our auditors.
785	Can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into Sitara for the Chicago office - the book/counterparty name will be Enovate.
785	The Arthur Anderson auditors have requested this information.
785	They are doing an audit of Enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit.
785	you should not have to go back farther than 01/00.
785	Thanks for your help and shout if you need anymore information.
786	Kam Keiser suggested I give you a call, the auditors have requested all the deals for the Chicago office books.
786	I need to get a list of all TAGG deals since 1/00 that are done with the book FT-ENOV and INTRA-ENOV.
786	Is this possible.
786	I need to give a list to Arthur Anderson as soon as possible.
786	Thanks for your help.
787	I think the only other solution is to post two curves, one with an SP and one with PR.
787	You should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type PR and have it look to the SP curve.
787	Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value, just two different risk types.
787	The only other option I see is to change the deals back to the "old" aeco curve that we used prior to this.
788	I am in
789	Attached is a book request for two new books - one for Lavorato and one for Cuilla.
789	Due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve, we are going to have to go the route of Canada on these Aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for VaR purposes.
789	Please set the two books up like Calgary's book(Sheet 1 on the attached file) We need to start doing this tonight, because Hunter and Lavorato want their VaR reported correctly tonight.
789	They both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their VaR.
789	I apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that I can get this fixed for tonight's VaR.
789	Please let me know any additional information I can provide you.
789	Thanks.
790	this incorporates the change of Stevens orig.
791	FYI, I will show you how to work this spreadsheet, just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why.
791	Tell him it is like Brian Gillis' file in Canada.
791	He needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the MMDDYYYY format.

793	Thanks.

794	Any deviation from this will result in bodily harm to you and your family.
795	Jennifer who?
796	I had no problems accessing it.
796	Thanks.
797	This book simply replaces a book that we were officializing for position purposes only.
797	We have a separate gas daily calc that is for value that goes into our P&L.
797	Nothing has changed with that book.
797	Please shout with anymore questions.
797	Thanks.
798	The deal still has not been signed, so nothing is currently in those books.
799	correct.
799	The information contained in this book matches the information that is in another book that you capture in our P&L.
799	Thanks.
800	schrab is going to have to answer this question.
800	He put the deal in after sep began.
800	Sorry I can not help.
801	Do not suspend this CPID, because we have physical and gas daily deals that are active in this book.
801	Sorry for the delay.
801	Thanks for your help on this.
802	Bharat asked that I forward this information to you.
802	Could you please map the following curves to the appropriate omicrons.
802	Monchy and NGPL-IA-IL should be mapped to chicago - omicron #11 and St. Clair should be mapped to omicron #14.
802	Do I need to also send this information to Burton in the controls group?
802	Thanks for your help.
803	here is an updated list of the omicrons
804	according to Bharat, he still does not have access to this screen.
804	Is there anyway you guys can do it today and he can continue trying to log in and do it for us in the future?
804	Thanks.
805	Thanks.
806	Sorry you could not open it, it was a pretty funny PowerPoint slide.
806	Your brother still has not responded to my email.
806	I talked with your dad last night, I think we are going to be hitting dinner with them in the next week before they head out of town.
806	Hope pregnancy is going well.
807	Can you map the following three curves to Omicron curves.
807	Nilay did his side and I need you to do the other side according to the IT guys.
807	Can you let me know when this is done so that I can get Souad's VaR rerun.
807	Thanks for your help.
807	You also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on Friday.
808	here are Souad's book names, Bharat is going to give you the portfolios: Thanks for all of your help.
809	We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are absolutely set man.
809	If they stop selling it, we can get it over the internet, it is just a little pricier.
809	You need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.
809	I think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.
809	We still need to get you some soup don't we?
810	This should be mapped to Omicron 3
811	how about Friday?
812	maybe it was over the internet that the bread was so expensive.
812	You guys still have charger fever out there after a few loses?
813	he is in vegas
814	Dude - you are freakin riot.
814	I almost fell out of my chair with that one.
814	You know what else does....crawfish pie
815	Her name is Sladana Kulic.
815	SHe goes by Anna.
815	Thanks for your help.
815	She is really excited about talking to you and I will bring her by and introduce her.
815	Thanks again.
816	All indications are that we will be here.
816	I have not heard anything new to the contrary.
816	If you need to take it off, take it as vacation for now.
817	unfortunately I will be on vacation.
817	Thanks for the offer.
818	see this spreadsheet, you will see that previous months match.
818	This spreadsheet comes straight from our crude guys.
818	If the counterparty continues to disagree, get documentation from them and we can take it to the crude guys.
818	Thanks.
819	Here is a list of the types of deals that always fail: GDD Dawns deals EOL#2054274 Physical dawn deals fail - EOL will only let one trader map their deals to one physical book(don't think you can fix this one) EOL#2047749 Mich basis swaps EOL #2054712 This should be a comprehensive list.
819	Thanks.
820	attached is a file from the IT team for the tagg numbers that are in the Enovate books.
820	Please shout if you have any questions.
820	Thanks.
821	Russ/George - has this new location been mapped to the same curves as the previous location - PGLC/NGPL?
821	From my standpoint, I think that is the only thing that needs to be done with the exception of changing/adding swaps on these deals.
821	Please let me know.
821	Thanks.
822	I have a pre existing meeting on this day, I can attend the Monday session.
823	This report just in on the wire.....
823	3 students at Louisiana Tech have been detained on possible immigration violations, their names: Bin Losin, Bin Cryin, Bin Whinin They were captured at a football game between La Tech and Auburn University
824	we definitely got a scare this weekend.
824	How bout those Bolts!!!
824	Took down the Mighty Broncos.
824	Have you been to any games this year?
825	I am sorry, but that will be the only game the chargers play the rest of the year I will not route for them.
825	I am a die hard Raider fan(I am sure they are your least favorite team).
825	How about LaDanian?
825	He is ripping it up for me in fantasy.
826	FYI : When entering deals with Canada, please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ECC and Riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ENA to ECC.
826	Also remember on gas daily out months(2 legs) that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be INTRA-CND-WE-GD not INTRA-CAND-WEST(this book is for basis piece).
826	ALSO: Please remember to check your new deals completely every day, this will help eliminate future OA variances.
826	Do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes.
826	Thanks.
827	just think if he came to camp on time how many yards he might have.
827	I am a big Lester Hayes fan, I wish they still let them wear stick em!!!
827	I think he called it stick em and he just ran his hands through his hair.
828	Jason has never heard of him, but is going to ask around.
828	I will keep you posted.
829	here is the updated file.
830	In
831	NXAVC is just like nymex, it settles as one price for the entire month.
831	I don't know what you mean look for pricing for 9/11-9/14.
831	NXAVC is a monthly index.
831	Please clarify.
832	I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.
832	These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.
832	I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.
832	We will have to try and work on this for this month.
832	The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.
832	Sorry for the confusion.
833	unfortunately, I do not have any information about these deals.
833	With these being IT day deals, the schedulers and traders will have all of your information.
833	sorry.
834	try sylvia pollan, she is the originator on the deal.
835	Try these instructions and let me know if this works.
835	Thanks.
836	I can not remember if I called you Friday or not.
836	Let me know when you want to get together and go over the consumers stuff.
836	Sorry if I forgot, the mornings are the best for me.
837	FYI - keep an eye out for this.
838	Here in lies the problem.
838	These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.
838	Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.
838	This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.
838	For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.
838	It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.
838	The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.
838	Same deals, different issues.
838	Thanks.
839	trip to steamboat: Jan. 13-19 $425 a night for a house that sleeps 10.
839	That works out to $500 a couple for the week(6 nights).
839	That will give us 5 days to ski(or 4 on 1 off).
839	Continental flys directly to Steamboat for $300 roundtrip.
839	Need to know interest level ASAP.
839	We have to pay 50% upon booking the house and %50 within 30 days of arrival.
839	I will pay the %50 up front, I just want a firm committment that you will be going.
839	Take a look at the house: It is the bettger house
840	random people that obviously don't work as hard as you and I and they have the time to spend all day surfing the internet.
841	I apologize, I forgot to tell you earlier today that Jason and his family have not heard of this guy.
841	Like you said he must be in Double Springs
842	Please look at Sheet 1(2).
842	You will see there are numbers Lee attribute to You and I. I wanted to go over the months that there is a large difference - see what counter parties make up the difference so that we can determine the absolute correct number for him.
842	I also wanted to discuss OA if we have time.
842	I have a 10:30 meeting and if you need to get back to the auditors, we can address at a later date.
842	Thanks.
843	I won't be visiting that country
844	what is this I hear that you may have a new job for me?
844	I hope so, we keep going in the toilet on Wall Street.
844	My 2,000 options are now all worthless.
845	that is what I plan on going as for Halloween
846	Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.
846	I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.
846	This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.
846	This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.
846	Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.
846	To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule: Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.
846	If that happens to be midnight, sorry.
846	That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.
846	Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.
846	Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.
847	maybe we will try that.
848	just incase you haven't gotten enough to read about us lately
849	so I guess I have to start calling you fancy pants.
849	Just call me THE HARPOON.
850	by the way congrats on the girl.
850	Is it going to be Mallory?
850	She is going to be 6.5 feet tall
851	I like the name.
851	I think it is beautiful and distinguished.
851	I hope she is at least six feet tall.
851	There is nothing wrong with a tall drink of water.
851	Gotta run and get some work done.
851	PL
852	please do ASAP.
853	here are the values: Thanks.
854	look at slide #20.
855	Jennifer 334-844-1491
856	2-5, so much for the nice machine
857	hey you are not wearing your target purple shirt today are you?
857	I have mine on and I don't want to look silly
858	thanks.
858	We talked with Martin Cuilla last night and he thinks we are missing some transport usage tickets that will offset a major portion of our gain.
858	Thanks for your help.
859	most current.
860	here is the location of the file and the person that compiled the file,.
860	Please let me know if you need anything else, thanks.
861	FYI
862	looks like this deal got zeroed out and rebooked on #1019677 look and see if you see this - CP should now be CPR pipeline exchange.
862	No variance should occur.
862	Thanks.
863	The report named: EMW Positions , published as of 10/30/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
864	we flashed this as Union, they subsequently moved the volumes on GL to CPR pipeline exchange.
864	you have to look at both to get this to reconcile.
864	Does this make sense?
864	If not, give me a call.
864	Thanks.
865	The report named: EMW P/L , published as of 10/30/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
866	Per Jad - Done
867	sounds good to me.
868	absolutely
869	The report named: EMW P/L , published as of 10/31/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
870	The report named: EMW Positions , published as of 10/31/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
871	Can you do me a favor similar to Kam's previous request: Can you add to my current profile all the books that Scott Palmer currently has calculation access to.
871	Could you also set Bruce Mills, Kristen Clause and Edward Brady up like Scott Palmer.
871	Additionally can you also set up Ashley Worthing like Anne Bike.
871	Thanks for you help and shout with any questions.
872	Thanks.
872	It has also been a pleasure working with you.
872	I am sure our paths will cross again in the near future.
872	Thanks for all of your help the last year.
873	The report named: EMW Positions , published as of 11/01/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
874	8 hours
875	absolutely
876	That is fucking hilarious.
876	It would be even funnier if it had been you that got kicked out instead of me...I have already talked to the bartender and he understands that in the future, we pour our drinks in the bathroom, not right in front of stadium personnel...Also, next year - he is sitting with you!
877	I will be there...
878	my original response.
879	I really would like to see the contract to verify things are not being booked correctly.
879	I spoke with Patrice and she does agree that we should not have a large receivable balance.
879	Try and get me the contract and I will see what I can do.
879	Thanks.
880	This time table of 6 p.m.
880	is not acceptable for risk management.
880	Most days we are not done calcing the gas books by 6 p.m.
880	Now we have just learned that Oracle is down and we do not know when we will get to start the calcing process that we normally start at 3:30.
880	Please adjust accordingly.
880	Than|
881	thanks.
882	I actually was just wanting a copy of the confirms or contracts that we/they signed in order to verify the prices and volumes.
882	I will try and work on asap tomorrow.
882	Thanks.
883	I approve.
883	FYI - please let everyone know in EOL of the following changes that are effective as of today - I am now over the East desk, Kam is over the West and Scott Palmer is over Central.
883	Thanks.
884	total bill was $230.
884	Thanks.
885	that is fine.
885	Shouldn't spend all of your money on booze and tickets to a game that you only watch half of.
886	we will be in an offsite training session all day Thursday.
887	FYI
888	Please pass on the condolences of another part of the Auburn family to Mr. Walker.
888	We are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother.
888	From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.
888	We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.
888	The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.
888	We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.
888	Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.
888	Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.
888	We would really like to donate money in her name.
888	Thanks and War Eagle.
888	The Love Family Dianne, Phillip and Ashley Houston, Texas Class of 69', 71' and '93
889	Can you let your group know that we have made some changes in responsibility in Risk Management.
889	Kam Keiser will be responsible for the West Desk, Scott Palmer will now be responsible for the Central Desk and I will now be responsible for the East Desk.
889	Please pass this information on and direct future inquiries accordingly.
889	Thanks.
890	boy she looks great.
890	So beautiful.
890	Ashley and I are still waiting for a phone call so we can bring dinner by.
890	Darron and Kristi wanted to join us.
890	Give me a call 37376.
891	Please pass on the sentiments of at least 3 Auburn Alumni.
891	The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.
891	We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.
891	Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.
891	As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.
891	The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.
891	Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.
891	Thanks for your assistance.
891	The Love Family Dianne, Ashley and Phillip Class of 69',71',93'
892	I wish you would come back - it would give our stock price a shot in the arm...press release...DK is back at work!!
892	I will talk with DG and get with you on a date, we are pretty busy around the holidays, maybe we can hit something up during the week.
892	Does Gary get home at a decent time during the week?
892	I now am over the east desk, so my hours recently increased.
892	We will see.
893	still do not have anything from a contract standpoint.
893	I will try and put some time into it today.
893	AS of last Friday, I now have responsibility for the East desk instead of the Central, but I will include Scott Palmer in my work since he now is over the Central.
893	I am not abandoning you, it is just that my workload has drastically increased trying to wrap up central desk issues, get Scott up to speed and get myself up to speed on the East desk.
893	We will get a resolution ASAP.
893	Thanks.
894	She is moving to the west, Scott palmer is moving to the central and Anne is going to Industrial Markets
895	sorry for the delay
896	you sure...I know I don't add much value, but I do not want to put stress on everyone else.
897	thanks
898	Take a look at the items below let me know if you need any help.
898	Thanks.
899	I forwarded this to Scott Palmer, he is the new lead of the Central desk.
900	I hope be here.
901	Here it is, my changes are in red.
902	I am sure you guys will be on your way home be the time us risk guys leave.
903	and for those that are email challenged(Scott Palmer) you sent it twice.
903	Don't worry, we do not have to worry about O'Neal, Sunday is not daylight savings time.
903	I got them to move the tournament two weeks so we could count on O'Neal for the first game.
904	can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.
904	I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.
904	Thanks.
905	could you please grant access to myself and Ed Brady for the books that Alejandra Chavez currently has access.
905	This is for ERMS/PortCalc.
905	Thanks for your help and shout with any questions.
906	Thanks.
907	thanks.
908	got your message last night.
908	What is up?
908	Bet you are glad you are not working for the big E. Things are not too good here.
908	Just waiting for the ax to drop.
908	Hope things are good in SF.
908	Talk to you soon.
909	I am in.
910	sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.
910	We also went to the Renaissance Festival.
910	Things are getting pretty hectic around here.
910	There are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.
910	It is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in. We are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.
910	If I do get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.
910	How are things in Denver?
910	Good I hope.
910	How is that baby?
910	Is she getting bigger?
910	I hope so.
910	Drop me a line and let me know what is going.
910	Thanks for the call.
911	In
912	can you get me copies of the August Invoice.
912	Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).
912	This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.
912	Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.
912	It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.
912	I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.
912	Thanks.
912	I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.
913	yep
914	The report named: East P/L Totals , published as of 11/12/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
915	Can each of you please set up minibooks for any deals in your books that are with any Dynegy counterparty.
915	We have not gotten the request yet, but we expect Lavo to ask Gossett at any time for this info and we want to be prepared for a quick turnaround.
915	Thanks.
915	Shout with any questions.
916	Per our discussion in the staff meeting.
917	Just wanted to send you an FYI - due to problems that are caused for RAC, please roll your P&L's each day from your daily file and not the regions file.
917	The RAC group looks at our P&L's in the region files each morning to determine rho and drift and this causes a problem if you have saved your P&L after rolling(it appears as though you have data already captured for current day because it copies and pastes formulas from the prior day to current day).
917	Thanks for your help and shout with any questions.
918	FYI - based on a call I got from Chris Abel in controls.
918	Not sure if any of your guys roll from the regions file instead of daily.
919	number here is 713-853-7376.
919	If you come back to Houston and are job hunting, please give me a call.
919	Thanks for all of your hard work and helping with the transitions process.
920	FYI we have made some changes in responsibility in risk.
920	Kam is now the desk head for the West Desk, Scott Palmer is now the desk head for the Central Desk and I am now desk head for the East Desk.
920	O'Neal remains over Texas.
920	Thanks and please share with your colleagues.
921	The report named: East Position Totals , published as of 11/13/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
922	The report named: East P/L Totals , published as of 11/13/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
923	I agree with the espey call too, let me know if it is a go and I will talk with him.
923	Is it still just a two month deal?
924	I will be on vacation on Friday.
924	Sorry.
925	as far as I know the exchange is closed next Thursday and Friday and we are not calcing books.
926	Kam Keiser suggested that I email you regarding ERV publishing access.
926	I am taking over the East desk from her and I need to be able to publish the trading track books to ERV.
926	Please shout with any questions or concerns.
926	Thanks.
927	FYI - notes from a conference call today

929	The report named: East Position Totals , published as of 11/14/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.
930	much more informative than Lay's email last night
931	HERE IT IS.
932	FYI when we put in a new deal in sitara we only update the volume section(top section of sitara).
932	We do not touch the expected volumes area - that is for schedulers to make changes and modify.
932	Please shout with any questions.
933	FYI - remember to have one of your team members take home all of the trader packets tomorrow and come in extra early on Monday to deliver them to the traders.
933	I think we also talked about last week that we need to make sure everyone was here by 7 a.m. on Monday.
933	Please shout if you guys disagree.
934	FYI - since we are moving this weekend, do not put your trader packets on your trader's desk tomorrow night.
934	Give them to Bruce(since he is the slowest) and he will bring them in Monday morning and distribute to our trader's.
934	Everyone needs to be here by 7 a.m. on Monday in order to answer any questions your traders have and test out your systems.
934	If things are messed up, we want to get the IT people first.
934	Thanks and shout with any questions.
935	THe file is in the ERMS/1Intra/Central/Sithe TCPL Transport 1115.

1010	no thanks necessary - you have done a great job - now keep it up.
1010	The courts are going to rule if some bonuses can be paid out - there are no guarantees, so I would not count on them approving it.
1010	They are supposedly negotiating to have us stay on 5 & 6.
1010	Nothing really new on those fronts.
1011	here it is.
1012	I am still here.
1012	I have a contract through March 1 of next year, so I should be here at least until then.
1012	The absolute destruction of the company has been pretty brutal - some of the people lost everything in their 401K.

1022	here is the excel file for value of empire.

1024	Couch can you put the query file you set up for the price desk?
1025	FYI - and you will also have to continue to calc physical books - deals not moved from those calcs yet - value and position.

1026	yes 21st is cool.
1026	Just use this as a time to help out and do any projects that come up and use up all of your vacation - doubt it will be there to carryover.
1026	As far as I know, our employment status has not changed - we have made no changes to the "list".
1026	I would not worry for now.
1027	take a look at them.
1028	please set up the book attached asap.
1028	Thanks.
1029	I will do it Wed and Thursday.
1029	Kam and I will be out Friday, can someone else do it then?

1030	Your math looks good to me.
1030	When can I expect my $140?
1031	please reactivate/unarchive the following books - we are going to have to start calcing these today.
1031	Intra-Central-Phy and Intra-East-Phy.
1031	Thanks.
1032	Kam is on vacation the rest of the week.
1032	She has requested that we send you the bankruptcy post ids.
1032	They are as follows: Price -1446982 Index -1446984 Please shout with any questions.
1032	Thanks.
1033	thanks Kam, I was going to do it this morning.
1034	standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.
1034	Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.
1034	The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's Eve so you might generate hard feelings.
1034	I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.
1034	You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.
1034	If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.
1034	I am sure other hotels have the same.
1035	done.
1036	FYI - this is set up and has been added as a tab to the bankruptcy post id sheet(CAN).
1036	If you open the attachment, you will see she set these up as MMBTU/USD books in Risktrac.
1036	I talked with Cecilia and she has changed this in ERMS/TAGG effective today to be GJ/CAD.
1036	Not sure how this happened, but it is fixed now.
1036	Should not have any problems, there is nothing in this book currently.
1036	Let me know if we need to calc these when I get back on Wednesday.

1042	file is saved to o:/_dropbox/finanical transprt 1220
1043	While I was out Friday, we were expecting to get letters for people to sign for Netco, any news on that?
1044	here is the forwards detail minibook.
1044	Looks like three deals today.
1044	I have sorted by counterparty and period.
1044	Looks like a few of these deals go out to calendar year 2002.
1045	FYI -looks like everything is fine.
1045	sorry for the mix up.
1046	Intra-East-Phy should be Intra-Northeast-phy.
1046	Is this in risktrac?
1047	Just wanted to let you guys in on a few things we have talked with Gossett about.
1047	Today we officially begin the process for the New Company.
1047	That being said, we now have to tighten the ship a bit.
1047	From now on, please refrain from playing games and surfing the internet all day.
1047	If you are bored and don't have anything to do, please look for things to do that are work related.
1047	This is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in. Read some options books, study macros in the P&L's, etc. The key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month.
1047	All of this is coming from Goss and it is serious, to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best.
1047	I know this sounds harsh, but we have all had a nice vacation and I am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job.
1047	It looks as though bidders will be in this week, so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give.
1047	Please pull me aside or email me if you have any further questions.
1047	Thanks and Happy New Year.
1048	let me know what she says, I have my request filled out and saved in the same directory, I will send it to her when we know if she can do it.
1049	I just got back from lunch, when you get a chance, please stop by and we can talk about you coming to risk.
1049	I sit at the end of the row at the row behind the flag that says gas risk management.
1049	Thanks.
1050	thanks.
1051	nice.
1051	real impressive.
1052	I saved the file for us to send to Susan Trevino for all the book access requests.
1052	I added the control group and put goss, kam, valdes and his people in there.
1052	So make sure you add that group to your book requests.
1052	Please take a look at this file and let me know if we need to make any changes.
1052	I plan on sending this file to Susan Trevino by tomorrow afternoon.
1052	The file in located in the Netco directory under controls/desk matrix.
1052	Thanks.
1053	FYI - the head hunter that I have been talking to forwarded this job description to me.
1053	If you are interested in talking to her, let me know and I will give you the info.
1053	She told me the salary is in the $140's.
1054	I wouldn't expect anything.
1054	I am sure everyone will move over as a lateral.
1054	They may do retention packages, but I have not heard anything.
1055	I have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes.
1055	I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.
1055	My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.
1055	I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.
1055	Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add, said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.
1055	Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.
1055	Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.
1055	This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.
1055	I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.
1055	Phillip Love Acct.
1055	Number 00W-80016440
1056	sorry Pop, I forgot to send this to you.
1056	My home email is plove@houston.rr.com.
1056	Talk to you this weekend.
1056	I heard Auburn got rid of Off and Def coordinator.
1056	We will see if that changes anything.
1057	I hope it is not Woody, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.
1057	He is horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.
1057	We need to get someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.
1057	I am afraid if Tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone.
1057	I got a digital camera for Christmas that works real well, I will get some pictures to you.
1058	Guess what I just heard - Steve Spurrier has resigned.
1058	No word yet on where he is going...check out espn.com I got a Canon Elph 100 Talk to you soon.
1059	are you still in?
1059	I need to get your nt login so you can be given access to the calcs.
1059	Thanks.
1060	Susan, attached is a new matrix for each desk.
1060	This should replace the previous matrix you are using.
1060	We are just putting our groups down in the access request list and this should be used to cross reference.
1060	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1060	Thanks.
1061	Please add Financial and Control group to these book requests if they are missing.
1061	We would like for everyone to have access to these books that is on that matrix we sent you.
1061	Thanks.
1062	I have no idea...hopefully we will know soon
1063	I passed this on to my boss and he is not interested at this time.
1063	Thanks for sending it and please keep me up to date on any opportunities you see that look good.
1063	Thanks.
1064	I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.
1064	They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.
1064	Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?
1064	If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.
1064	Please let me know.
1065	FYI - I have done the west and I have resaved this file out there.
1065	I highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow.
1065	If we all do this, we should be able to use the same list.
1065	I added a column to the file and put IM S/B, LT S/B and Daily S/B.
1066	I fixed 1127631, the other deal , I do not have a confirm from you on and it is already priced at NX1 + basis.
1066	Please let me know if you need something further on these deals.
1067	Saw this morning we hired Petrino.
1067	I did not realize how successful he has been at the college level.
1067	Three times his offenses have led the nation in offense.
1067	He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.
1067	He has three playing in the NFL now that he developed.
1067	I think this might be a real good move.
1067	How are things there?
1068	done.
1069	looks like Florida will not be very good next year.
1069	They are losing their best players to the draft.
1069	All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.
1069	Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.
1069	Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.
1069	See what happens.
1069	Did you get your pool cover fixed?
1070	What is up my California buddy?
1070	Staying out of trouble?
1070	Things are going pretty good here.
1070	You believe Steve Spurrier?
1070	IT is a great deal for Auburn and the SEC.
1070	Time for a new dog to get on top.
1070	What is my little friend Emma beans up to?
1070	I bet she is growing and talking up a storm.
1070	Are you guys coming to the Fest this year?
1070	Just to offer you a little encouragement, I found a special fare for you out there on southwest non stop both ways....here is the link.
1070	Only $250 a person.

1073	Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.
1073	So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.
1073	Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).
1073	I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.
1073	Two for one baby, you can't get a deal better than that except at Costco.
1073	Plus, I almost forgot the best part - we have a little TV for the burban so you could get a little MLB 2001 action on the way.....(give me enough time and I will keep it coming) P.S.

1074	FUCK YOU
1075	We need to take the central off before the NY, NY Market, southeast curve files.
1075	We need to add the GDI East curve file.
1075	Also add the two east phy/gas daily curve files - o:tds/tds curve/east/intramonth & gas daily files/eastprodnewstyle and eastmktnewstyle.
1075	Sandra's curve file is o:tds/tds curve/east/fteast.
1075	The P&L files are o:erms/1intra/ireport/2002/0102phy/regions/EATP0102 and o:erms/erms_adm/firmtrad/2002/0102/regions/Intra-East Transport 0102.
1076	The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.
1076	We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.
1076	The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.
1076	Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.
1076	Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.
1077	I have set up the new basis curves for West and the are based off the old curves, so they are in the old format.
1077	They are located in the Netco Directory under west/curves/CA BASIS NEW and WEST BASIS NEW.
1077	I am still working on GDY and Phy/GD.
1077	The Phy/GD is in the new format and will be located in the same directory as the above, with the title West phys curves.
1077	GDY will be in the same location as filename West GDY and it is also in the new format.
1077	The phys/GD file will be complete tomorrow and the GDY will be done today.
1078	For West: Risk(give these people access to all regions)- Phillip Love Randy Bhatia Melissa Videtto Stephanie Hopkins Ryan O'Rourke Zach McCarroll Traders(just West access)- Mike Grigsby Phillip Allen Keith Holst Frank Ermis Jay Reitmeyer Jane Tholt Matt Lenhart Jason Wolfe Matt Smith I will have Patti Sullivan from logistics send you her list.
1078	Thanks.
1079	Would you mind sending Russ the list of your people that will need access to sitara in NetCo.
1079	I have send him the list of traders.
1079	Thanks.
1080	come down whenever, we can find something to show you.
1081	thanks.
1082	Done.
1083	I agree.
1084	Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.
1084	That is why this deal was killed.
1084	You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.
1084	Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.
1084	It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.
1084	Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?
1085	Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
1085	If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.
1085	It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.
1085	Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?
1086	Attached is a file from EOL that has all the current products.
1086	We are trying to do a mass mapping for the systems of all of these products.
1086	As you mentioned, not all of these products will roll out initially, but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system.
1086	I have put in the old trader's names in a column(column F).
1086	If you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over(names highlighted in green).
1086	Also, there are no current products under Jason Wolfe, Matt Smith or Jane Tholt.
1086	Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.
1086	Please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book.
1086	The list I gave you this morning is the financial books we set up.
1086	Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
1087	Let O'Neal know if you will be in or out so that we can get some fillers.
1088	thanks for the file.
1088	I am attaching the basis curves we have set up and the GDY curve file as well.
1088	I am finishing the physical as we speak.
1088	Please look at these three files and let me know if you would like any changes.
1088	We are only putting the published curves in the files, at least to begin with.
1088	West Basis is the rockies at southwest curves and CA basis is the california markets.
1088	Thanks.
1089	Thanks for the EOL products email.
1089	I am attaching the curve files.
1089	The CA Basis is the California markets and the West Basis is Rockies and SW.
1089	The third file is the GDI curves.
1089	Please review and let me know if we need to make any changes or additions to this file.
1089	They are pretty simple and straightforward and do not link to anything currently.
1089	Let me know what you think.
1089	I am sending them in three different emails because of the size.
1089	I will have the physical/GD curve file to you by Monday.
1089	Thanks.
1090	Looks like the search continues.
1091	thanks.
1092	I can not open the file...Is this the kid from the man show selling beer?
1092	I have also seen him trying to buy beer.
1093	that is absolutely hilarious.
1093	I have heard a rumor that the Chargers are considering moving to LA....Is that correct?
1093	That will be absolutely horrendous.
1093	I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.
1093	Truly awesome.
1093	My man at the time Winslow(racist) got carried off three times.
1094	Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.
1094	I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.
1094	All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).
1094	This will then set the gas daily curve.
1094	We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.
1094	You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.
1094	The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.
1094	We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.
1094	I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.
1094	I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.
1094	Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.
1094	Thanks.
1095	What????
1095	I thought that was your team?
1095	I am a big raiders fan and I hope Chucky gets that ring this year.
1095	Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested - March 13-16th.
1095	Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the three nights.
1095	I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if you are interested.
1095	Take care.
1096	I just saw a fare from SD for $68 roundtrip....I have to seriously consider moving out there if it is that cheap to go to Vegas.
1097	hahaha.
1097	I am talking to Bosse on the phone and both of us fell out of our chairs with that one...You kill me chef Vito.
1097	P.S.
1097	Bosse said bring your ass to New Orleans
1098	just win baby...
1099	I will get her on it.
1099	I will have her wear on denise in the same manner I am wearing on you.
1100	I was under the impression that there was an outstanding A/R and A/P balance on this counterparty in the 4-5 million dollar range.
1100	Should be pretty noticeable.
1101	I think there is also some stuff under a subsidiary of NICOR, Northern Illinois.
1101	Make sure both are included.
1101	If you guys can get the balances and which deal numbers are outstanding I think we can match up with the CPR reports that I have.
1102	should be Nicor and Northern Illinois.
1102	If you want to round up the deal numbers/invoices and such, we can get together and I can show you the deals I am showing a variance on.
1102	I took an adjustment to the desk for 5.7 million and that is for Jan 00 - Oct 01.
1102	production only.
1102	Let me know.
1103	thanks.
1103	That sucks
1104	The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.
1104	I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.
1104	I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.
1104	This is correct.
1104	Thanks.
1105	Pretty funny.
1106	absolutely.
1106	I will make the changes and have something to you this afternoon.
1107	Please modify the curve files you are currently loading to incorporate the database changes.
1107	These changes need to be made today.
1107	Please ask myself or Russ if you need any help.
1107	Thanks.
1108	I need all of your official post ids from your old books for the date of 11/30/01.
1108	Please email them to me ASAP.
1109	Are you going to handle this?
1110	thanks
1111	please let me know what risk types each of these postids is please.
1112	Here it is.
1113	already got them slacker.
1114	here is the file.
1114	You would change the two curve tabs and the publish tabs are linked up.
1114	The BOM file is unchanged.
1114	The two basis files now only have basis curves in them.
1114	Let me know any changes you would like.
1114	Thanks.
1115	I suppose
1116	east is done.
1117	Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some money...On Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.
1117	Make your money while you can.
1118	Do we need to make any changes to the EOL products?
1118	I see that Steve South is now on the trader list, does he need any products for EOL?
1118	I will work on the curves and get with you on a first pass.
1118	Thanks.
1119	I apologize, we have been a little delinquent on the thank you cards this year, we are usually really good about it.
1119	He got those horses and absolutely loves them.
1119	We got him a fisher price farm for Christmas and he had just opened that when he opened the horses.
1119	We couldn't get him to open another give for half an hour playing with those horses.
1119	They go great with the farm and plays with them all the time.
1119	Thanks.
1120	Here is a rough draft of what we discussed yesterday, let me know what if any changes need to be made and we can sit down with Couch.
1120	Thanks.
1121	Greg Couch forwarded your email address to me saying you were interested in some Enron logo sleeves of golf balls.
1121	I have four sleeves of Titleist Tour Prestige 90 and 8 sleeves of Pinnacle Gold Distance golf balls.
1121	Please let me know if you are interested and what you are willing to pay.
1121	I am going to put them on EBay tonight if I do not here from you.
1121	If you are not interested, I apologize for the message.
1121	Thanks
1122	That is funny.
1122	I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.
1122	You might want to sell them.
1122	We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night Live.
1122	Pretty funny stuff.
1122	Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.
1122	Ash is working her too.
1123	I think they have finally changed the way our addresses work.
1123	It is phillip.m.love@enron.com for now.
1123	We will see if it changes to UBS.
1123	Where are you traveling to today?
1124	not sure what happened.
1124	I think I am fixing to put a whole bunch of Enron stuff on Ebay, people are making money hand over fist with this stuff.
1125	The books title is Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives by John C. Hull.
1125	The publisher is Prentice Hall and the ISBN # is 0130224448.
1125	Thanks a million.
1126	Isn't it crazy.
1126	Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.
1126	Unbelievable.
1126	I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in. We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.
1127	I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).
1127	So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.
1127	I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.
1127	I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.
1127	I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.
1127	If you are interested, let me know.
1127	Thanks.
1128	I feel confident I can sell them on EBay for at least $25 a sleeve, so I will go at that way.
1128	Thanks anyway.
1128	Good luck.
1129	attached are the curve files for your part of the West - basis, index, GDY, phy and gas daily.
1129	Please take a look and make sure I have not put a curve in the wrong region.
1129	Due to size, I am sending them in three different emails.
1129	Thanks.
1130	Per an email from Mike Grigsby, I understand we are splitting the west into two regions.
1130	You are going to be doing the SW and socal per Mike's email.
1130	I am attaching the curve files we have created.
1130	Please take a look at them and make sure I am not missing curves or have included wrong ones.
1130	We are only going to be setting published locations initially.
1130	I am sending you the curves in three parts due to the size of the files.
1130	The Index file has phys index and GDY, and the Phy file has BOM phys and GD.
1130	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1130	Thanks.
1131	I just left you a voice mail and wanted to follow it up with an email regarding the termination of deals.
1131	Please start forwarding these requests to myself and Darron Giron.
1131	Scott is heading another project for Gossett and Darron and I will be handling terminations from today forward.
1131	Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions.
1131	Thanks.
1132	This is done.
1133	Congratulations on winning the auction on Ebay for the sleeve of Titleist Golf Balls.
1133	Please let me know if you will be paying by PayPal(alove@houston.rr.com) or money order/cashier's check.
1133	The total is $64.
1133	I will mail the balls priority mail as soon as I receive payment.
1133	Thanks again and use this email address if you reply before this evening, alove@housotn.rr.com is my home email and I can not access it from work.
1133	Please email me your address so that I can send them.
1133	Thanks again and look forward to hearing from you soon.
1134	Thanks.
1134	I will put the balls in the mail today.
1135	Congratulations on winning the auction on EBay for the Enron Values cube.
1135	Please let me know if you will be paying by PayPal(alove@houston.rr.com) or by money order/cashier's check.
1135	As soon as I receive payment, I will mail the cube by priority mail.
1135	Please send me your mailing address.
1135	If you respond during the day, respond to this email address, the alove@houston.rr.com is for my home account and I can not access it from work.
1135	Thanks again.
1136	FYI - total is $18.50
1137	Please send another sleeve of those pinnacle golf balls to the address below as well.
1137	He has paid our paypal account.
1137	Thanks.
1138	I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.
1138	I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.
1138	There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.
1138	I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.
1138	If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.
1138	Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).
1138	If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.
1138	I need a response as soon as possible.
1138	Thanks.
1139	Add Steve South to the Trader list and remove the following from Risk: Zach McCarroll, Stephanie Hopkins.
1139	Thanks.
1140	can you get the process rolling on this additional book for the west.
1140	Thanks.
1141	Sorry for the confusion.
1141	I was sending out several emails today.
1141	I will send out the golf balls when I receive your money order.
1141	The address for you to send it to is: Phillip Love, P.O.
1141	Box 890086, Houston, TX 77289.
1141	Thanks and sorry for the confusion.
1142	give me your mailing address and I will get those golf balls in the mail.
1142	Thanks.
1143	need your mailing address to send golf balls - I received your paypal payment.
1144	I would suggest you take it up with EBay.
1144	See my attachment regarding EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.
1144	I have tried to contact the person that you outbid - the person that bid $60.
1144	He has not responded.
1144	I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.
1144	I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount.
1144	I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack.
1144	$61 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend.
1144	I hope the person that bid $60 will respond and "get you off the hook".
1144	Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene on your behalf.
1144	I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it looks like you approved a bad bid.
1144	Sorry.
1144	Good luck.
1144	Non-Paying-Bidder / Final Value Fee Credit Request Program This is your place to learn about eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Program and supporting features.
1144	Start here if you're a: * Seller who has a non-paying bidder and would like a Final Value Fee credit for your unsold item.
1144	* eBay user who is interested in knowing more about what happens when high bidders don't pay.
1144	Non-Paying bidders face the following consequences through this program: * First offense: warning * Second offense: warning * Third offense: Indefinite Sust to do if you're a seller with a non-paying bidder 1.
1144	Contact each other Contact each other after your listing has ended.
1144	Like you, buyers can have emergencies or computer problems.
1144	Your high bidder may not be able to respond to you right away for legitimate reasons.
1144	Generally within 3 business days is a good idea.
1144	2.
1144	Payment Reminder .Send a payment reminder email to your winning bidder.
1144	You can customize the email.After 3 days but not past 30 days of your listing's close.omplaintForm>File a Non-Paying Bidder Alert if you still don't get a response or if you feel you may not receive payment.
1144	Remember: In order to collect your Final Value Fee credit, you must complete a Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form on time.
1144	eBay then will send an email to you and your high bidder.
1144	Your high bidder will be reminded to pay you and informed of the consequences if no payment is sent.After 7 days but not past 45 days of your listi4.
1144	Request your Final Value Fee credit .Request your Final Value Fee credit if you've: a) Filed a Non-Paying Bidder Alert 7 days or more after your listing has ended and b) Tried unsuccessfully to resolve things with your bidder 10 days after you've filed the Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form above.
1144	Your refund will be credited to your account within 48 hours.Within 60 days of your listingWorked things out with the buyer?
1144	If you have filed the Final Value Fee credit, you may use the Non-Paying Bidder Warning Removal to remove the warning for the bidder.Within 90 days of your listing's close.
1144	Special note about Dutch Auctions: They work the same as other auctions with one exception: You may file a Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form only once per auction for as many bidders as necessary.
1144	That is, you cannot go back and file additional Alerts if you have more non-paying bidders from the same auction.
1144	Special note to bidders: If you are a bidder and believe you received an unfair warning, you may appeal it by using eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Appeal Form .
1144	Warnings will remain on your record until they are successfully appealed.
1144	Visit our Non-Paying Bidder Frequently Asked Questions <
1145	As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.
1145	I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.
1145	For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.
1145	You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.
1145	Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.
1146	This is an issue you need to resolve with EBay.
1146	I was more than willing to work out a negotiated payment with you since I was willing to take your word you made a mistake, but you have been very rude from the beginning.
1146	Good Luck.
1147	FYI - not sure if you know this yet, but you need to become verified on PayPal before your payment can go through.
1147	This usually entails you getting the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted - usually pennies.
1147	Once you are verified, I will receive the funds and I will mail out the cube.
1147	Thanks.
1148	Please send this person a sleeve of the titleist balls - should be in the garage and send a sleeve of the Pinnacle balls to Robert Stokes - you should have an email in your box from last night.
1148	Also would you mail the two envelopes on the counter.
1148	Thanks.
1148	I have a UBS meeting offsite until 2 p.m.
1148	today, I will have my phone with me.
1148	Thanks - Love you.

1149	The file is saved in 1intra/NYMEX Breakdown.
1150	I just want to be crystal clear on the file you sent.
1150	We need to move all of these deals to the Bankruptcy book?
1150	Thanks for your help.
1151	Please divide the list between several of us.
1151	Thanks.
1152	Just curious if this got done last night?
1153	Please let me know when you get close to being complete so that we can hold off calcing if necessary.
1153	Thanks.
1154	Is this the last list we are going to get?
1154	Jeff Gossett wants to know if we are done so that we can assure Don Miller that all of the CP's have been taken care of.
1154	Thanks.
1155	Can you tell me if this is the last financial list we are going to get?
1155	Jeff Gossett wants to be able to tell Don Miller if we are completely done or not.
1155	Can I also get a master list of all financial CP's we should have moved to the bankruptcy book.
1155	We want to run some reports to make sure IT has gotten them all out of the Price book.
1155	Thanks.
1156	FYI - here is the info I have.
1156	As she said, not exactly the answer we wanted.
1156	I am still waiting on a final list to cross reference with our calcs.
1157	We can now calc the price book and we will cross reference the list with a fwd detail of the price book to verify there are no deals with terminated counter parties.
1157	Because of the translation to the bankruptcy book, we can not calc the bankruptcy book for a while, so we will cross reference those in the morning.
1157	I will keep you posted.
1158	would you prefer me mailing or delivering personally to you?
1158	I was planning on shipping this afternoon.
1158	Just let me know.
1158	I will be out of the office tomorrow.
1158	Let me know whatever you prefer.
1159	This is complete.
1159	These deals have been moved previously.
1159	Thanks.
1160	Attached is a file with the CP's that are terminated per Kim's list and had been sent to IT to move to the bankruptcy book.
1160	There are six CP's on this list.
1160	I will send the legal names to Cecilia to get these moved today(with 7,000 lines, I am afraid it would take at least a day for risk to move manually).
1160	We will then recheck the book tonight.
1160	As you will see on the summary page, the total value of these deals is $(61.6M).
1160	If there are any questions, please let me know, I will bring hard copies to the 11a.m.

1190	Thanks again.
1191	Darron and I may need it if Ed does not cut the cord by tomorrow.
1191	I would prefer not to have access to force him to use the estate people.
1192	Can you do the same thing with a different book id?
1192	Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.
1192	Financial deals only.
1192	Thanks.
1192	Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1199	If this is true, I do not know what or when my email service at work will be back up.
1199	Please send in the mean time any emails to plove@houston.rr.com.

1200	NG-Price contains All physical and All intercompany ENA-FT-WC-SJ Financial Deals that are out of the money ENA - FT-WT-SOCAL Financial Deals that are in the money Shout with anymore questions.
1201	Do you have an estimated time on retranslation?
1202	thanks
1203	We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the terminations being processed in a timely manner.
1203	It appears that all Netco employees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.
1203	In case this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests.
1203	Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder and Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.
1203	Please send these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I. As a side note, could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has changed since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deals are moved to the proper book.
1203	It is probably a good idea for future termination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.
1203	For example the price book has been basically split into three books.
1203	Please shout with any questions or concerns you may have.
1203	Thanks.
1204	As far as I know(see previous email), this is the most current list.
1204	I would also use this list to verify the basis options are up to date - per our conversation earlier(Pat & Chance).
1205	any changes in the Jazz Fest verdict?
1206	March 13-16th.
1206	You in?
1207	I am going to call the vet school and check the authenticity of this.
1208	will do.
1209	just confirmed it with the Vet school.
1209	They asked we "keep it quiet" because they had to sign a confidentiality agreement saying it would not be promoted.
1209	He said as long as the wind is not too strong, she will fly in the first 45 minutes of the show.
1209	Record it and we can watch it when I am there next Friday.
1210	done.
1211	at least through today.
1211	Not sure when they will be taking away our access and put us on a UBS server.
1211	For now, email me at home - plove@houston.rr.com How are things going?
1211	Good I hope.
1212	I been serviced nicely, although a BJ would have been a nice bonus.
1213	I do not unless I start working for you and have to worry about accounting issues.
1214	not sure if this got done yesterday by Francis and Sanjeev.
1214	Can you let me know.
1214	Thanks.

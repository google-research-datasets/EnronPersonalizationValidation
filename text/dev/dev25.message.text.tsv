0	1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.
0	Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal.
0	2) The all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price, it is dependent on load shape.
0	3) That is correct.
1	I was wondering why I am not eligible yet.
1	I sent gave my agreement forms to Tricia Henry yesterday.
2	Yes I am
3	Does this information reflect the additions of the IBOC or not?
3	Otherwise the info seems to be what is going on right now.
4	If you look at the Cal 03-Cal 10 period, you see that there are roughly 25,000,000 MWh.
4	Two days ago, 1 had only 6.5 contracts/day hedged.
4	In the past two days, I sold 2.5 contracts/day.
4	In the past two days, the Cal 03-10 swap has increased C$0.47.
5	Here is the spreadsheet that I sent you at the beginning of the year when we set the curve marks to show the NPV 600,0000 CDN.
5	These are the heat rates that I am referencing in the Hedge Summary sheet.
6	Here are my comments on the original guarantee My phone is 974-6749
7	John Lavorato already said that he would make JD report directly to Canada.
8	I was meaning to give you a call this week and inquire as to when you guys are planning to come up.
8	Things are good here.
8	Feeling poor as well.
9	Please give Enpower access to Murray Fichten, John Messenger, Mike Taylor, Tyler Seminuk
10	I hope stock goes to $35 so I can buy it at reasonable levels.
10	Things are well here.
11	I will attend
12	Financial settlement occurs between Enron and the customer.
12	The pool is agnostic to what its participants do (i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool, consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool)
13	I just need the positions aggregated, I don't need the desks broken out
14	I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.
14	Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.
14	Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.
14	The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.
14	The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.
14	The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)
15	Yes, he said to leave the reports the same as it is now
16	yes thanks John
17	Here is the hedge summary for July 3/01.
17	Two things to note are: 1) I bought 125 MW of Cal 02 flat from Mirant for a 10 GJ/MWh heat rate 2) There is now a 20 year AECO basis curve, so the fixed price AECO gas from cal 15 on is generated off this curve.
17	Before the AECO basis curve stopped at Cal 14
18	I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.
18	In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.
18	I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.
18	The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).
18	Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.
18	This implies a heat rate of close to I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.
18	Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.
18	The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be: a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge) See what you think??
19	home number is (403) 685-4817
20	I think you need to do this.
20	They want the info today for PRC reasons.
21	John, I lost the following on 2nd order in the options book (in Canadian $): Total (1,336,772) Prior to June 29, the largest 2nd order was <15,000
22	Can you explain this in english to me??
22	This just talks about July 6, what about the days since June 29.
22	I hope that the curves for today came down ok.
23	This is not just a July 6 issue.
23	Before June 29, my 2nd order effects have been less thatn 15000 CDN$.
23	For the following days, my 2nd order effects have been: What is going on?
23	Can you explain ?
24	Offer price is $61.50
25	NO
26	Lets try before Fri, as I am planning to take that day off
27	should be ok
28	unable to attend at that time due to a prior appointment, I can meet with you individually later some time
29	Karim, I don't want to wait till month end, let's adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order, lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts.
30	The total 2nd order up to and including July 16 is (1,891,851)
31	Your numbers amount to a adjustment of (1,746,675), were the total 2nd order from Jun 29 was (1,891,851), now I understand that I would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference I just thought that (145,176) difference (i.e. (1,891,851-1,746675) which should be the true 2nd order) was a bit high.
32	Same price as other volume, start date is fine, e-mail me for confirm
33	I won't have it until tomorrow morning because of a deal entry error in my 2002 position
34	Can you change John MacKay's name in the Natural Gas Fixed Price Positions by Trader, Natural Gas Basis Positions by Trader, Natural Gas P&L to Chris Lambie.
34	John is being relocated to Houston and Chris Lambie is now in charge of the Alberta Gas Term Desk.
34	Additionally, can you merge the P&L under MacKay and Add.
34	Trading into one line item and call it Lambie.
34	Therefore Lambie should be (41,480) as of yesterday's report.
35	Congrats, Harvard is OK not as good as Chicago though.
35	Just joking
36	Does this resume interest you?
37	Thanks for making the changes on the P&L and fixed price positions report.
37	Can you also change the natural gas basis position by trader report from MacKay to Lambie?
38	I'll be there
39	My wife and I will be there

41	sure
42	Not really, maybe 0.5 HR in Aug only, rest in unchanged
43	Will the Telus and Cisson deal appear tonight?
43	Because I haven't seen the Cisson deal of +53K yet?
44	It didn't, check with Karim and let me know today.
44	Thanks
45	Karim , this is the deal that I was talking about this morning.
45	Albert is saying that it should have appeared in Friday's P&L.
45	Can you check this with him and let my know today.
45	When you said it was in tonights P&L, I think Albert was talking about the Telus deal not the Cisson deal.
46	I recognize that Aug 17 is Jason Garvey's last day, I am fine with that date.
47	Looks pretty cool.
47	I think we can use it
48	I am interested
49	I was talking to John Lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week.
49	Do you have a copy of that?
50	unsubscribe pjm-customer-info
51	The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows: Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.
51	Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.
51	We analyzed the offer stack and it appears that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0 I called Doug Heath to discuss this.
51	He hasn't called me back.
51	The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK.
51	I received a justified answer.
51	However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.
51	Can we pursue this.
51	Thanks John
52	these are all ok
53	I am sure that John Lavorato will want to see a presentation for the Alberta Power Fundamentals.
53	To save the hassle of develop powerpoint slides.
53	Is there a way that we can simply tie a projector to the computer and run it off of our website.
53	Additionally, can you enter the new known generation in the database.
53	I am sure that he will want to see this as well.
53	He will be in the office on Wed afternoon.
54	We should make reservations for: John Lavorato Rob Milnthorp Derek Davies John Zufferli Eric LeDain John MacKay Chris Lambie John Disturnal Mike Cowan
55	can you update slides 13-16 as of end of July
56	Jason can you make a power point slide with the following spreadsheet.
56	Just use the number of trades and volume of trade columns (i.e. the first two)
57	Call us from London when youget there
58	Do you have our flight info?
59	Looks right
60	Can you re-activate the Alberta Power Pool Access to EnronOnline.
60	Although this entity doesn't trade, it is important that they have access to the Alberta Gas and Alberta Power product for view only.
60	This is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province.
60	They use our info about AECO gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province.
60	Therefore, they need to see the Alberta Power market data on EOL.
60	Thank You John Zufferli
61	No problem.
61	Just arrange it with Angela.
62	yes
63	As a policy we only provide this info to customers who do business with us.
64	Sorry Nella, I replied a while ago directly to Rob Milnthorp
65	This seems fine.
66	Here is a copy of the script.
66	Let me know if you have any comments.
66	We can meet at my house at around 7:30 PM tonight.
66	phone: 685-4817 Can every dress up in as bushman or farmer outfit as you have.
66	It might be funny for Rob to wear a hockey jersey with the letter C on it.
66	Does anyone have a chalkboard?
66	Kyle can you bring you abacus?
67	Have you got you Enron Online reactivated yet?
68	Nella, the trade volume info looks correct.
68	It is the new counterparty info that is incorrect in Q1 - we had 8 new counterparties for the Alberta Power product in Q2 - we had 2 new counterparties for the Alberta Power product
69	I sent a request to reactivate the PowerPool of Alberta's view access to EOL Alberta Gas and Alberta Power.
69	The request was sent to the help e-mail address 1 week ago.
69	To date the powerpool has not received access.
69	Can you inform me how long it will take?
69	Thank you.
70	This sounds fine.
71	Power Trading will need about 6 seats.
72	Just respond to Angela with how many seats you think you'll need.
73	Infield
74	No problem
75	I don't have any immediate needs.
75	I don't know if anyone would want to come work for Canadian Pesos anyway.
75	Sorry I couldn't be more help.
75	See you
76	Things are ok.
76	How is the new family addition doing?
77	I'll be there
78	Sure.
79	Looking forward to it
80	We can put him in sean's seat
81	I have given Bill Greenizan formal authority to be your direct supervisor.
81	Bill will be the point person for any questions, development issues and concerns that your group may have.
81	You are still welcome to approach me at any time.
81	However, I feel that given my increased responsibilities with the gas group, it would only be fair to the four of you, in terms of career development, to have more frequent and detailed interaction with Bill.
81	Thank you.
81	P.S.
81	I would like to make this announcement in person but as you know it is difficult to get all four of you at the same time.
82	Good for me
83	Yes and send me his resume
84	I'll be there
85	I don't have a need for traders here in Calgary now.
85	I don't have a softcopy of the application.
85	He should think about Harvard and MIT
86	Give me a call after 3:00 PM MST tomorrow
87	One of us will attend
88	John Zufferli Bill Greenizan Cooper Richey of Enron will attend
89	CAN YOU SET UP GREG BERRY IN DUNCAN CROASDALE'S OLD SEAT.
89	THANKS, JOHN
90	We can have you sit down with John Disturnal, Chris Lambie and Mike Cowan in informal interviews.
91	I'll send it Tues morning
92	I understand that the car has 130,000 km.
92	Has the engine been rebuilt?
92	When were the brakes last changed?
92	How is the clutch and transmission?
93	No I don't know about a power plant in Ontario.
93	How is it going in Seattle?
93	Hope all is well.
93	Give us a call sometime.
94	I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.
94	I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.
94	The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes.
94	I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that.
94	However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.
94	The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.
95	This afternoon is busy for Derek and I but we should be able to squeeze in a few minutes
96	For the trading group, not including back-office staff .....
96	Director 3 - Mike Cowan, John Disturnal, Chris Lambie Associate 2 - Cooper Richey, Rob Downer ( probably Chad Clark and Stephan Brodeur) Analyst 7 - Ryan Watt, Lon Draper, Fabian Taylor, Ian Cooke, Carlos Torres, Chad Clark, Stephan Brodeur Non-Commercal 4 - Murray Fichten, Mike Taylor, Tyler Seminuk, John Messenger We probably need two more analysts
97	i will attend
98	Just replace me with you
99	Can you grant Chris Dorland all requested access for EOL trading.
99	John Zufferli
100	I traditionally send them on Tues morning.
100	I will send it tomorrow.
101	This letter is good , just get Sharon to give me a copy to sign.
102	Corporately, we are not allowed to trade currency outside of Houston.
102	In the same way, we can't make markets on other traders' markets.
102	If EOL has enough products in currency, we may be able to post our numbers on the screen inside of the Houston currency traders' two-ways.
102	I am unsure if we are even allowed to do this.
103	Have you reviewed that ladies resume that I gave you 2 weeks ago?
103	If so what do you think?
104	John Lavorato asked me to contact you regarding any and all info you have on the Owens Corning transaction in Alberta.
104	Please return my call at 403-974-6749
105	I have got my page set-up in excel to print all the info.
105	The info is there.
105	I just don't think that Kim has her excel page setup to print the info (I assume she is the one printing it out for you).
105	Do you want me to call her?
106	I don't remember my userid and password for the e-mail 4-life
107	I received a spreadsheet from Richter but do you have any contract documentation?
108	Assume that the interview was final round
109	My fax is 403-974-6706
110	To my knowledge we are not building a power plant in Ontario.
110	I have been meaning to give you a call.
110	I will try sometime this week.
110	Talk to you later
111	one of you guys should go to this
112	Do you still have the forms for the 4 hourly people (Tyler, John, Mike, Murray).
112	I tried to go into the PEP and get them but it is closed.
113	When is the interview date at Wilfred Laurier, Guelph and Waterloo?
113	Can they all be put on at the same time, either on or off-campus?
114	Not material so don't do anything.
115	Just get with me when you are in
116	I don't have time to go to your office, you have to come here.
116	I am in the process of setting curves between 3 and 4.
116	I never know when I am done since I am dependent on Houston currency and gas curves.
116	So if you could be here at 4 that would be good.
117	Take the TransCanada Hwy 1 west to Calgary.
117	This becomes 16 Ave N in the city.
117	Take Highway 2 south (Deerfoot) when you get in the city.
117	When you come to the Deerfoot/Glenmore intersection take Glenmore Trail East.
117	On Glenmore, you'll pass under Macleod Trail (there is a big mall Chinook centre on your right), you'll pass over the Glenmore reservoir.
117	When you get to Glenmore and 37 st get in the inside lane of Glenmore.
117	After 45 st, Glenmore will split in 2, stay in the inside (i.e. leftmost lanes).
117	This fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto Highway 8 Bragg Creek.
117	On highway 8 you will pass 69st, after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on Lower Springbank Rd.
117	At the the stop sign turn left onto Lower Springbank, you should now be going parallel to Highway 8.
117	After 85 st and before 101st there is a gravel entrance road on your right, take this road, it is 100 feet long and leads to Slopeview Dr, turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 133 Slopeview Dr.
118	I'll call him, I have to arrange to be there when he can come since it requires me to lift the TV with him.
119	The import/export units are fine, here is the SD3 SD4 info
120	YES
121	That is the Saturday after the management conference in San Antonio, I was planning to stay down there for the US thanksgiving.
121	So tentatively, I won't be there Conference is Nov 14-16
122	This is correct, except that a significant portion of his cost should be reapplied to Enron Direct
123	Hey Jim and Greg, Jessica and I sent a card to Chris's wife asking about his well-being and this is the unfornate response.
123	Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 3:04 PM Subject: From Anne Wodenshek Jessica and John, Thanks for the card, yes Chris was in the WTC, 105th floor on Tuesday the 11th...2 days after our 12th wedding anniversary.
123	I hadn't spoken to him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.
123	I only hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer.
123	Some of the other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they said that they were going to be evacuated.
123	None of the 36 people who worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive.
123	We are all in a state of shock and disbelief.
123	Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.
123	He was the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and respectful person I have ever known.
123	He never had a bad word to say about anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.
123	The children and I, (5), feel like our lives ended that same day.
123	I can't imagine moving on or ever being happy again.
123	There is no reason for this dispicable act...this world will never be the same.
123	There were many articles about Chris in various papers here in NJ and NY.
123	I was also on CNN when we were searching for him.
123	You can find these at the Starledger.com, NYtimes.com, the Stamford Advocate, Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa.com website.
123	I have set up a trust fund for the children if you are interested.
123	The address is The Christopher Wodenshek Children's Trust c/o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court Street Hackensack, NJ.
123	I am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris, but that sounds familiar to me.
123	If so, I wanted to let him know the Ted Mahoney ( or Maloney?) was also at Cantor and is also amoung the missing.
123	Thanks again for your kind card and prayers.
123	Please continue to pray for peace in our and our children's time!
123	Fondly, Anne, Sarah, Haley, Mollie, WIll and Zachy Wodenshek
124	What is the asking price of this vehicle?
125	I am not sure what New Start is?
125	Any details?
126	BTW, I think I have a bye on this video.
127	The currency P&L is missing from the preliminary again.
127	We shouldn't post P&L to the executive management reports with missing components.
128	Also, instead of sending me the P&L via e-mail, arrange to have someone here to put the P&L and new deal reports on my desk as usual.
128	Thanks
129	Also, where are my gas reports
130	I don't have the P&L summary with post ID's for my gas books as of 10/12
131	Unfortunately, the timing does not work for me
132	I agree, I feel the same.
132	It feels like we are getting left behind.
133	Looks ok to me from the trading side
134	I plan to attend
135	Where is my preliminary P&L for Oct 16?
136	Once again , the EOL report is ignoring the new customer list that I have given twice now.
136	They seem to insist that the the Canadian subs that are now tradinig Alberta power that have traded other products on EOL are not new customers.
136	I have all but given up on this issue.
136	In terms on of # of trades/day for Alberta Power, the numbers for Aug and Sep are low: I will check the gas info later
137	Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.
137	John Zufferli
138	Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.
138	I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/
139	I never wrote nor implied that I was intending to hedge currency exposure with a third party.
139	I implied that I will hedge with you guys when and where I deem appropriate in the term structure.
140	There is nothing in my inbox.
140	I have no form to sign.
140	Could you deliver me one please?
141	I want to install some reporting measures on position limits and VAR metrics here in Canada.
141	Can you give Brian Gillis the necessary access so that he can prepare the reports for me.
141	If you have any questions give me a call ?
142	derek can you forward me the e-mail for the management conference?
142	my e-mail puked and deleted everything in my inbox.
143	I have no memory of receiving this info.
143	Can you send me another?
144	Rick & Laura Figueroa Brian & Amy Brewer 11927 Canyon Mills Dr. Carrie Grin 3502 Burlington St #3 5610 Island Breeze Can't wait to see you guys.
144	Sorry if I sounded scatter brained when we talked on Wed, I was trying to watch the gas screen and trade at the same time.
144	Hope all is well.

156	CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun.
156	Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said.
156	Gurung then was allowed to pass through.
156	Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said.
156	The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft.
156	He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond.
156	CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks.
156	Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee.
156	(Full story ) In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified.
156	After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west.
156	There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar.
156	Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.
157	It's 2200 miles to Houston, to far to drive

194	I am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.
194	I can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.
194	I would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.

194	I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.
194	Thanks
195	Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since: a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential creditor action against Enron.
195	Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.
195	The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.
195	Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.
195	b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.
195	The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be done until the month.
195	If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.
195	In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.
195	c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.
195	With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at 4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.
195	d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.
195	It is very beneficial for later on in life.
195	Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this category, but not like a mortgage.
195	Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.
195	I think that this is the best solution in the long run.
196	If the legacy deals move to NETCO then we need the ability to trade Canadian gas.
196	Canada would not be out of business if we only traded US denominated financial products but it reduce our daily transactions by 75%.
197	what is your number at work?
198	Enron Canada Power Corp acknowledges the change in the sink asset from CH1A to CH1U for contract #1947 for the period of Jan 01, 2002 HE1 to Dec 31, 2002 HE24 Thank you John Zufferli
199	Nella here is a list of products that we would launch on EOL in NETCO.
199	Assume the the products listed under the Financial heading are launched on day 1 and the the products listed under the Physical heading are launched at a later date.
200	Here is a list of products and counterparties
201	Is is possible to import a lotus elise and get it converted to left-hand drive and road compliant?

203	congrats to Ali I had to fly to houston on monday on last minute notice, we have been bought by UBS Warburg, I hope that the deal works out and looks good for me, don't know yet but I am excited, how is the condo going?
204	Yes, he worked for me, he ran the AECO option book, we let him go since we were not sure of our future at the time, he is setting up the BP Amoco options desk He is a very smart guy and understand options very well, he is late thirties and has been trading for some time
205	things are going well,hectic but more steady now that we are bought by UBS, at least steady in mind jess is doing well, just 6 weeks left, she is getting to the uncomfortable phase now how are you doing in portland?
206	Cooper is doing fine he is still breathing according to him
207	I can't afford to bump anyone, unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch.
207	We are trying to separate the cream from the cream.
207	Given that, and working on the assumption that Dan D is a rock star (i.e. not knowing him from Adam otherwise) I think we should relace Lalani with him.
208	do you have the internet addresses and directory details put togethor yet
209	After some brief discussions with UBS in Houston, we must wait before we can make final determination of our functional currency.
209	We may be evaluated in Canadian dollars rather than American.
209	I must get some direction from UBS
210	Can Dorland and Chad meet me and Mili in Video 1 at 9:30 and when these guys come back can Cowan and Lambie come to Video 1
211	Can you send my curves and trades for Jan 18
212	I am reading your mail, I have asked for the same thing regarding my base.
212	Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in Houston.
212	Not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 USD/year lower than what other shops are offering.
212	However, after three attempts, I have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.
213	i don't even know your salary now.
214	WOW, that was higher than I thought.
214	That is not much different than mine and higher than other Directors in the office.
214	I am not blowing smoke, but given my experience, there is nothing that I can do at the immediate time.
215	No I never got the sweater.
215	I was thinking about that on the weekend.
215	I'll pick up the gift for you.
216	can you prepare how the ontario market works presentation for myself and derek davies
217	no the packages haven't come in. Kacz's called a we are going to pick up the gift.
217	Warburg is still progressing, just waiting on offer letters.
217	I will be in charge of canadian trading, that will include ontario power - a new market that i will have to learn about.
218	A buddy of mine is selling this stuff and is just starting out, if you need a helmet, contact him.
219	Can you send me the Jan 18 trades and marks as well as today's trades and marks before 3:00 PM today, thanks John
220	will this be video conferenced in calgary
221	i lifted it last night for 82,000
222	yes i gave him a verbal
223	We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.
223	We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e. the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).
223	Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.
223	The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.
223	From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.
223	However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.
223	There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.
223	It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.
223	To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.
223	The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.
223	They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.
223	This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.
223	As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.
224	subject to mechanical inspection from the Vancouver Porsche dealership.
225	they are working it still
226	can we possibly move this meeting up from 3:30 PM to sooner?
227	Danielle, in general we need everything that Houston gets in addition to the info that is listed as Calgary on your spreadsheet.
227	One information source in not listed on your sheet.
227	IHS Accumap Priority 2 Contact: Carmen (403) 770-4503 phone, (403) 874-4218 cell Can you tell me if anyone in Houston is working on setting up accounts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS, ESBI?
227	These are gas and power related entities that we have to have accounts with the schedule physical gas and electricity.
228	Here is the list updated with responsibility names.
229	garrett, you should look into buying an advanced ticket to come up to calgary for a week in a week or so, we can go through next steps, fundies, etc. BTW, we got 3 feet of snow in the mountains this weekend, powder everywhere!!!
230	according to the packet that was distributed in the meeting today with BC, it appears that Calpine, El Paso, Williams, AEC Marketing, AEC Storage are all FEB 1, this doesn't jive with what you just sent, wassup?
231	1 user of accumap I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary
232	when?
232	i am free anytime this aft
233	who at UBS should we talk to?
234	one thing, we should wait before we dole out all 250 until we hear from others
235	I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney, the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account
236	Feb 1 AEC Marketing physical gas Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical gas El Paso Merchant Energy physical gas Williams Energy Marketing
237	can you call me regarding this

239	that was our plan but I am not sure whether UBS has the proper Canadian corporate structure to allow to do that yet
240	Stephane Brodeur should be removed from the list.
240	I am not sure about Chris Lambie, whether he is joining the company.
240	Garrett Trip should be added as the Ontario Power trader (that market won't open until May 2002)
241	Sorry for the delay, I had to do it twice since excell blew up on me and I didn't save it.
241	I hope that this is comprehensive enough.

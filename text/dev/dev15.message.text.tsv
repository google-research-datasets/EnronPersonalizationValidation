3	Jim, Harbor and Martel were declined with the CISO for 06/08/01 HE 1 and HE 2.
3	The reasons: for Harbor the CISO inc'd them to 10, and ignored their operating limits as entered at 60 and 80.
3	Martel was inc'd but could not ramp up.
3	Both bids were properly entered by were ignored by the CISO.
3	Delano was incd'd and dec'd several times in the morning and was able to respond.
3	Let me know if you have any other questions.
3	Thanks, Bill
4	Thank you Kysa, I appreciate the info.
5	We are long 25 mws in NP-15 at $54 for HE 7-22.
5	This is under the ST-WBOM line in CAPS.
5	We are long at $54.00 Call me with any questions...
5	Thanks, Bill
6	Let me know if you have any questions.
7	Jim, Just a quick note regarding scheduling on Saturday.
7	There should be a 25 mw n-firm export for HE 7-10 and HE 13-22.
7	The schedule ID for HE 7-10 was CISO_EPMI_BUNNY.
7	The schedule ID for HE13-22 was EPMI_CISO_BUNNY.
7	For HE 11 and HE12, Danielle at the CISO misentered our schedule.
7	CAPS shows a final of 25 mws as a firm import.
7	This should be a n-firm export.
7	We recieved the energy as a firm export from the CISO.
7	All schedules should be under ECTSTSW not ECTRT.
7	If you have questions please let me know.
7	Thanks, Bill
8	Jon, Thanks for the schedule.

8	Bill

10	Steve, Just want to make sure you have me as Bill Williams III.
10	Thanks, BIll
11	Group, We are long for the 13th in California, 25 mws under ST-WBOM in NP-15 at $57.
11	We are also long 22 mws under ST-CALI in NP-15.
11	ST-CALI is also short in the morning in SP-15.
11	They are short at around $30.
11	ST-CALI is providing us with a sheet detailing their positions for RT, we will now be providing them with a sheet each morning detailing their sales from the previous day.
11	Going forward, please put all the ST-CALI sales or length in the service sheet beneath our activity.
11	We are also short 10 mws to EWEB for HE 1-12, Willamette has a month long sale at $270 but needs to come down unexpectedly for maintenance.
11	We will backfill this and split any profit with Services.
11	Finally...
11	We must check out with BPA each hour for Frontier and GCPUD.
11	Please make the call right after you call EPE dispatchers (between 25 after and 35 after).
11	The new service sheets have a place for initials for the call each hour, please initial after making the call to BPA (ext. 2277).
11	ALSO...TIMBERS TOMORROW NIGHT!
12	Virginia, I have no idea.
12	I would recommend checking with Cara...she's omniscient.
12	Good luck.
13	Thanks for the work Bob.
13	I will see you on the 27th at PDX.
13	Bill
14	Thank you Jill
15	Group, We have 25 mws of length in the BOM book at $56 again for 06/14/01 on peak.
15	This energy is in NP-15.
15	Please make deals under ST-WBOM.
15	ST-CALI has another 5 mws each hour on peak in NP-15.
15	See CAPS for other information.
15	Thanks, Bill
16	Brooklyn, Unfortunately the change to $290 was not the final price for deal #620476 on 05/23.
16	It should be $295 for HE 15-17 and $290 for HE 18-19.
16	I have checked Enpower and the sheet to make sure that they reflect these changes.
16	If you have any questions, please let me know.
16	Thanks, Bill
17	Thanks for the information Heather.
17	This looks good and useful.
17	Would you have any information on what tools we used to settle?
17	Or was it all a manual process?
18	Rhonda, The CP "New" represents a counterparty as yet to be determined.
18	I am working with Diana Scholtes on this.
18	This deal is essentially a placeholder.
18	I will give you the information as I receive it.
18	Thanks, Bill
19	Chris, I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.
19	From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.
19	I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.
19	Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.
19	I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.
19	Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.
19	Feel free to see me with questions.
19	Thanks, Bill
20	Group, We are long 25 mws 7-22 on Monday in SP-15 at $65.
20	Deals should be under ST-WBOM.
20	We are also long 25 mws under the ST-CALI book.
20	Please be sure to put this in the service sheet.
20	Other ST-CALI length or EES shorts will be on Phil Platters sheet and in CAPS.
20	Thanks, Bill
21	Just wanted to congratulate you guys on the excellent work on the night of the 13th.
21	The SAR was within $4 of risk managment's numbers on the Daily Position Report!
21	The night note looked very good (great job on the services portion) and there were ZERO problems with the shift.
21	The hard work is much appreciated, keep it up.
21	Bill
22	Anna, When you have a chance, I would like to pay you for the golf tournament and grab a receipt from you while I am at it.
22	My impression is that the deadline is approaching and that this is something we need to get done today.
22	Please let me know when you might be available or just grab me when you have a chance.
22	Thanks, Bill
23	Dave, Good morning.
23	Just wanted to confirm my email with you.
23	It is Bill Williams III, not Bill Williiams.
23	Thanks for the email.
23	Bill
24	Steve, My address is Bill Williams III, Please make the correction.
24	Thanks, Bill
25	Thanks Lisa...
26	Cannot wait...
27	Please add Ainsley Gaddis and remove Daniel Kang from your list when sending the spreadsheets to EES.
27	Thanks, Bill
28	Kate, take a quick look at this would you?
28	Group, Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.
28	We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy.
28	Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import.
28	We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.
28	The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market.
28	Enron Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission.
28	If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return.
28	Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.
28	If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss.
28	I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations.
28	If we are in contact with Enron Canada before hand (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.
28	Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm.
28	Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow.
28	We are basically buying a put or a call.
28	Finally, I would like to see the communication with Enron Canada improve.
28	Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom.
28	I feel we can do better.
28	I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.
28	This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons.
28	Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.
28	This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial.
28	If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with Enron Canada please let me know.
28	To be sent to John Zufferli (equivalent of Tim B in Canada) and Portland Shift
29	These schedule changes must be called in. Just a reminder.
29	Bill
30	Nikki, Thanks for the note and I hope your doing well.
30	You're right, sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off.
30	I was able to close on my condo last weekend.
30	It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around, but I finally got moved in on Friday night.
30	I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far.
30	The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel.
30	My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown, so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work.
30	Like you, I am not sure what Brendan might have told you about me...so here goes.
30	I was born on the east coast (Connecticut), moved around for a while, and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents.
30	I went to highschool in Kelso (this is where I met and then graduated with Brendan).
30	Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle.
30	College was good, if a bit long.
30	I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis (whoa!).
30	A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with Enron as a trader, trading hourly electricity in the West.
30	I started out on shift, but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule (usually 10-12 hours a day) during the week.
30	I enjoy the job a ton, the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop.
30	With regards to your visit.
30	I've been in Portland for a few years now, so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town.
30	Depending on when you get here and how things go, we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast.
30	Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there (especially if you're from New Mexico).
30	If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt.
30	St. Helens and the gorge...good swimming, hiking etc. It should be a blast.
30	Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town?
30	I am pretty open at the start of July, and although it always rains on the 4th (EVERY single year), that's still a good time to be coming up.
30	Besides, if you ever thought about moving here, you have to understand why its so green...
30	It was good to hear from you, and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.
30	Take care.
30	Bill
31	Sure.
32	There will be a Real-Time Group Meeting on July 9th at 4:30.
32	We will be discussing new Ferc Rules, Dispute Management, Group Changes and Cuts.
32	Please let me know immediately if you will be unable to attend.
32	Thank you, Bill
33	Easy there...
33	Everything will be okay...
34	Actually Amy, I will not be able to attend on the 5th.
34	Is there an alternate date?
35	Heather, I spoke with Chris and he is on board with the annuity of $18750 from ST-CALI to ST-WHOURLY.
35	Thanks for the help with this.
35	Bill
36	Alan, Can we meet today and discuss the pros and cons of this order.
36	I will be available as soon as you are ready...
36	Thanks, Bill
37	Mr. Kuehn...
37	I like the BridgePort idea, unsure about the Food idea at ZOOP.
37	What did you have in mind?
37	Nate Stanton gave me a call today...we could invite him and folks from work...either way I am cool...also bear in mind that my place has no furniture...
37	JOY!
38	Looks good Ray!
38	Nicely summarized.
38	Bill
39	John, Thanks for the timely note.
39	PRC is today.
39	Much appreciated.
40	Here it is...
41	Alan, I just received this from our client rep detailing their position.
41	As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net.
41	I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary.
41	If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order, we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC (or you) recommends it.
41	Thanks, Bill
42	John, We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy.
42	We bid $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap.
42	We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so.
42	Bill
43	Group, CAPS will be down from HE 20 through HE 1 on Saturday morning.
43	We will have to use workspace and run Enpower to CAPS after HE 1.
43	We may want to run Enpower to CAPs early (or at least create finals) so that we do not lose any data if the whole thing gets erased.
43	Please call with questions.
43	Good luck.
43	Thanks, Bill
44	Nikki, Hello, how are things going?
44	Hope you've caught up on your sleep from California.
44	That's what I am going to work on this afternoon so I can enjoy the weekend.
44	I am so glad the week is over.
44	I am exhausted.
44	Nothing like if I had worked 92 hours though.
44	Sorry to hear you only have the night of the 3rd open.
44	Hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of Portland than just one afternoon.
44	There's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon.
44	As for where to stay, there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport, or you can stay downtown.
44	I can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as I will not be working on the 4th of July.
44	Give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend.
44	Bill
45	Group, A reminder.
45	My email address is bill.williams.iii@enron.com.
45	Bill Williams III needs to appear in the outlook box, otherwise I do not receive the email.
45	I should be copied on the EES sheets, and any cut notes to volume managament, the services desk, or other traders.
45	Thank you for making this correction.
45	Bill
46	Steve, Good looking notes this weekend.
46	Both notes were very informative and detailed.
46	I appreciate the good work.
46	Bill
47	Chip, As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.
47	We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.
47	If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.
47	Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in. We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.
47	We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.
47	Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?
47	Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?
47	All your help is appreciated.
47	Thanks, Bill
48	Karen, You must change your e-mail list for Bill Williams.
48	Please send this to bill.williams@enron.com.
48	Not bill.williams.III@enron.com.
48	Subtle difference.
48	But if you consider your information worthy of review - please make the e-mail change.
48	Regards Bill
49	John, How was Austin?
49	Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for?
49	How about golf?
49	Everyone has only ever had good things to say about Austin.
49	Audi TT?
49	NICE pick.
49	Is that a 6-speed?
49	Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right (matches the 400E).
49	Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.
49	I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).
49	Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).
49	An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).
49	Other ideas?
49	So I am in the new place.
49	It's great!
49	Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).
49	Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.
49	Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...
50	Any word?
50	We need those cards and passwords...
51	Group, We are long 25 mws on peak for 06/27/01 in SP-15.
51	This should be in CAPS under ST-WBOM, deals should be under ST-WBOM in Enpower as well.
51	Bill
52	Looks great Jill!
52	Thanks, Bill
53	Nikki, Hope you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago.
53	I have been planning on visiting him for a while.
53	I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down.
53	Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home.
53	Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice.
53	Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think).
53	So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit.
53	I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off.
53	So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time.
53	Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around).
53	I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd.
53	Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway).
53	I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt.
53	St. Helens on my bike instead.
53	It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up.
53	St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains.
53	We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains.
53	So work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to.
53	No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do?
53	Anyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland.
53	Oh.
53	And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do.
53	Brendan's got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you.
53	I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well...Brendan should be able to fill you in. Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture.
53	Enjoy your time in LA, And take care.
53	Bill
54	Enjoy.
55	Group, For 06/28 only: We need to send APS losses, 2 mws for HE 1 at 4C345 from EPE.
55	Lisa Gang has put this in the sheet and made a preschedule tag.
55	We need to make a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower, and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower.
55	Please make sure this schedule is in as losses.
55	You can call me with any questions.
55	Thanks, Bill
56	No There.
57	Cheeky?
58	Yup.
59	Kate, Need your help with MPC
60	I would be TOTALLY thrilled if you could let the group know...now about those MPC numbers...we need to go through the inc sheets and service sheets from last year...and we have half an hour.
61	Very well done Jill.
62	Go ahead and order everyone in the group who wants them the new phones.
62	Those Eriksons are constantly breaking down.
62	Let's get ahead of this curve.
63	Heather, We had some double deal-entry last night under the ST-WBOM book.
63	Consequently I zeroed the following deals out this morning after receiving the DPR and running a BOM SAR.
63	The deals are as follows: 665907 (buy from imbalance), and 665913 (sell to PowerX).
63	The extra sale to PowerX provided the excess $10,875 of revenue.
63	I apologize for our mistake.
63	Let me know if you have any questions.
63	Thanks, Bill
64	I will be out of the office for 06/29/01.
64	I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 if you need anything.
64	Thanks, Bill
65	Nikki, Good afternoon, How are you?
65	Hope everything worked out in LA.
65	I don't know if you are still coming up to Portland but I was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at PGE Park (the minor league baseball stadium up here) and figured I'd pass it on.
65	The picture was taken in the Enron suite at the park, I am the one directly in front of the TV.
65	The rest of the folks are from the Origination (not Trading) side of Enron, except my boss, who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it.
65	Portland has been nice the last couple days, though its been raining like crazy.
65	I went up on my roof last night, the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through.
65	Beautiful night.
65	The sun had already gone down below the west hills, but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place.
65	There was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head, and all around were low menacing storm clouds.
65	A stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain.
65	Amazing.
65	It should be a nice weekend up here.
65	In fact, I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf.
65	I am playing an hour north of Portland on a links style course.
65	If its a clear morning, I should be able to see Mt.
65	Rainier, Mt.
65	St. Helens, and Mt.
65	Adams.
65	It is an interesting course to play.
65	Now if I can just get the ball to go in the hole I'll be happy.
65	Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall.
66	David, Try to make sure you get these to me rather than to my Dad.
66	I think he is starting to get annoyed.
66	Thanks, Bill
67	Group, Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO, the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap.
67	1.
67	The current price cap is $91.87.
67	We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap, however we can (and should) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers.
67	2.
67	The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load (greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled).
67	Despite the CAISO's repeated protests (and the IOU's complete disregard of this order), WE can expect to be subject to this penalty.
67	3.
67	When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls.
67	These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack.
67	Therefore when power supplies become tight, the prices in the "expost" may actually drop.
67	We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible.
67	4.
67	We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market.
67	The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings, and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market.
67	5.
67	Remember to include CAISO export fees, Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges.
67	We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt.
67	Hood.
67	We will discuss other changes in the market at that time.
67	Please make plans to attend.
67	Thank you, Bill
68	This needs to go to Bill Williams, not Bill Williams III.
68	The difference is subtle but is rather important if you want the correct person to receive your message.
68	Please make the appropriate change in your contact lists and address book.
68	Thanks, Bill Williams III Manager Short Term West Hourly Trading
69	Group, Dave Perrino will be providing us a presentation on losses during the second week of July (tenatively scheduled for the 11th at 4PM).
69	There is some math/electrical engineering involved.
69	I have attached the presentation that Dave will give.
69	Please take about 10-15 minutes to get familiar with the presentation and prepare your questions.
69	Thanks, Bill
70	Fun Transmission link...proposed oasis...
71	Please go to this site, then print the map out in color.
71	I cannot print to Valena currently.
71	Thanks, Bill
72	Group, Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.
72	The oasis site map is The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t) Leg 4.
72	PATHC to PACE Leg 5.
72	PACE to FC3 We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
72	When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.
72	This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.
72	Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.
72	There will also be losses.
72	If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.
72	Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!
72	There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.
72	This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
72	Please see me with questions.
72	Thanks, Bill
73	Confirmation from Keoni on an unrevised price cap...as of 15:01...
74	Virginia, I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.
74	First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.
74	This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.
74	Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?
74	Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool.
74	Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.
74	The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753).
74	Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices.
74	The deal is now at $320 and $300.
74	What do we need to do to get this trued up?
74	Please come see me with questions.
74	Thank you for your help.
74	Bill
75	Virginia, I also had a question on a PMA from January.
75	On TransAlta deal #509285, your notes indicate that mw volumes for HE 23 and HE 24 were reduced by 95 mws each hour.
75	Enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change.
75	The PMA indicates a charge of $42750 for a reduction in our purchase from Transalta.
75	Why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy (ie. less money from us to Transalta)?
75	There is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade (sale to Sempra-Deal#509277).
75	Please come see me when you have a chance.
75	I think we need to go through this.
75	Thanks, Bill
76	Crystal, Good morning.
76	Haven't heard from you in forever and unfortunately did not get a chance to respond to your last email.
76	Just wanted to say hello and wish you a good Fourth of July!
77	Ticker on bottom works, nothing else really does.
78	Alan, According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.
78	We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.
78	This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.
78	When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio.
78	For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.
78	Any recommendations?
78	Bill
79	Troy, The difference is subtle, but I believe you wanted this to go to Bill Williams not Bill Williams III.
79	Please make the appropriate change to your address book.
79	Thanks, Bill Williams III Manager Short Term West Hourly Trading
80	Thanks for the update.
81	Fran, If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, deal #549160).
81	We should only lose $40 (the net difference).
81	Any ideas?
81	Thanks, Bill
82	Group, Two totally different issues for you.
82	First: When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.
82	We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.
82	We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.
82	Easy.
82	Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.
82	We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.
82	It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.
82	Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).
82	Thanks for your attention.
82	Bill
83	We will pay APS losses of 1 mw for HE 1 PDT only on July 4th.
83	Lisa has made the tag and put the losses in the preschedule sheet.
83	Kate has made the enpower for this deal (#672781, and #672785).
83	Please put the price in for deal #672781 (buy from EPE).
83	Thanks, Bill
84	Group, When doing swaps please use the swap function in Enpower.
84	Do not enter annuities anymore for financial deals.
84	Be sure to specify whether you are buying or selling index and then what index you are selling (NP15 inc/dec...etc).
84	An example appears in the attachment.
84	Swaps have caused disputes that have dragged on for months in the past, so call me with any questions.
84	Thanks, Bill
85	Jim, On Tuesday we sold the CAISO replacement reserves at Malin for HE 15 and HE 16, then HE 18 through HE 22.
85	We were exercised for the first 40 minutes of HE 15 (for the last 20 minutes of HE 15 our energy was uninstructued and we received the dec price).
85	For HE 16, and HE 18-22 we were awarded the capacity payment but were not exercised.
85	The capacity payment should be at least $91.86 for each hour it was received.
85	If you have questions, please let me know.
85	Thanks, Bill
86	Count me in...
86	Bill
87	Eric, I have forwarded this to Bill Williams.
87	Please note that there is a subtle but important difference between the two email addresses.
87	Please make the change in your address book.
87	Thanks, Bill
88	Chip, I need to have a tape pulled for Ryan Slinger on July 3 at 14:40 and 14:45.
88	Let me know when you have the time and I will go up with you to pull the tape.
88	Thanks, Bill
89	Fred can be reached at 1-915-543-4335.
89	Nice email to Fred on Tuesday by the way.
90	We could pull tapes?
90	Ask the person who did the deal?
90	There is nothing in notebooks.
90	Any word on the BOM PMA?
91	Good morning, Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMI_CISO_BLUE).
91	The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.
91	A purchase from the imbalance has been made.
91	Also for HE 12, we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.
91	Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.
91	We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.
91	Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.
91	We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower.
91	Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.
91	We are flat in CAPS position manager.
91	And flat in Enpower.
91	Thanks, Bill
92	Virginia, We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.
92	The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.
92	I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.
92	Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.
92	Fran is aware of this.
92	I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.
92	This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.
92	I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
92	The risk sheet is on my desk.
92	Thanks, Bill
93	Important, CAISO computers down at 2 PM.
93	Submit HE 17 and HE 18 before 2 PM.
93	Thanks, Bill
94	Thanks Chris, This sounds good.
95	Virginia, I have a dispute for you and Mike regarding WAPA on June 2nd.
95	Please come see me when you have a chance.
95	Thanks, Bill
96	Just come by when you have a chance or give me a call and let me know when you will be free.
96	Thanks, Bill
97	Kate could you check with the trader on this.
97	I really don't care if it is in or out.
97	Let's try to wrap it up before or after the meeting.
97	Thanks, Bill
98	Nice Job!
98	Looks good!
99	Guys, Great job on the cong last night but the EPE reconciliation sheet was not done.
99	Even if there are no variances, please complete the July EPE Reconciliation sheet going forward.
99	Houston will assume that no one ran the CARP if the sheet has no entries.
99	Thanks, Bill
100	Per our conversation, ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2, HE 23 and HE 24.
100	All congestion revenue was across Path 15.
100	All revenue was at $248.
100	Volumes were as follows: Total volume was 96 mws at $248, revenue should be $23808.
100	Please see me with any questions.
100	Thanks Bill
101	This is the new CAISO calculation for ancillary service charges.
101	Please look it over and let me know if you have any questions.
101	Thanks, Bill
102	Group, We are short 50 mws in SP-15 for HE 7-22 on Wednesday at $61.44.
102	Please purchase this 50 mws under ST-WBOM.
102	St-Cali is short 50 mws in SP-15 for HE 7-22.
102	All deals should be under St-Cali in Enpower and CAPS.
102	St-SW is short 20 mws in SP-15 for HE 7-22.
102	All deals should be under St-SW in Enpower and CAPS.
102	If you have any questions please give me a call at 503-887-3449 or 503-274-0502 Thanks, Bill
103	Group, Volume management needs us to create customer finals by 3AM each night in CAPS or FSP.
103	The details are below.
103	Please see me with feedback or questions.
103	Thanks, Bill
104	Thanks, I just left her another.
105	Sara, Check this story out, this is from a guy on our floor.
105	He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.
105	Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.
105	I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.
105	Didn't find one, and like Scott (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.
105	I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.
105	So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.
105	It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.
105	I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before.
105	So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.
105	So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.
105	Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.
105	The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.
105	The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.
105	The place turns into a frenzy.
105	Nobody can move, react, or anything.
105	Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.
105	A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk.
105	The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames.
105	I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.
105	The old woman is yelling ,"Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.
105	Who is this masked man, I have no clue.
105	However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is.
105	I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.
105	The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.
105	The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.
105	So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.
105	Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.
105	Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.
105	Take care, Scotty Pretty good story huh?
105	Different morning.
105	Things are going well here in Portland other than the omelette fires.
105	When do you get in to Seattle?
105	Take care and enjoy your last month in Colorado...
105	Bill
106	Donna, This brings us back to the age-old question.
106	During an emergency, how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is?
106	Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase.
106	The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's (LDWP, SMUD, etc.) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion.
106	And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty, and another counterparty for a "do-over" (could be assessed)?
106	We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages.
106	Thank you for the information and the follow-up.
106	Bill
107	Group, The baseball game will be on Thursday July 26th, NOT Monday July 16th.
107	Gates open at 6:30.
107	Refreshments and pizza will be provided.
107	Everyone should plan to attend.
107	Please let me know if you cannot.
107	Thanks, Bill
108	Sounds great.
109	Group, We are short 50 mws in ST-WBOM at $42.88 for HE 7-22 Friday and Saturday in SP-15.
109	I have picked up some shaped mws from the APX for the afternoon peak on Friday.
109	These pieces will need to be scheduled with the APX as the counterparty for HE 12-20.
109	Price is $35.
109	ST-CALI is also 25 mws short both days on-peak.
109	Thanks, Bill
110	We have also bought HE 10 and HE 11 from the APX.
110	We bought 35 mws for HE 10 at $35, and 31 mws for HE 11 at $35.
111	One more time.
111	We have also bought HE 21 and HE 22 from the APX.
111	We bought 20 mws at $32 for HE 21 and 23 mws at $30 for HE 22.
111	No more messages.
112	I apologize for the "glaring".
113	The CAISO has a new website.
113	The link below should take you there.
113	Workspace can be accessed by clicking SCW.
113	Congestion can be found under the Transmission tab on the far right.
113	Please take some time to become familiar with the new site.
114	Kristie, Hello.
114	How are you?
114	What are you doing these days?
114	I hope you are doing well.
114	It has been a while to say the least, but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough).
114	I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.
114	Brendan said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.
114	I hope you don't mind.
114	Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.
114	I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron.
114	I now manage the west hourly power trading group.
114	The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San Francisco, right?)...
114	My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance.
114	I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum.
114	The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.
114	It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.
114	It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.
114	The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.
114	The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.
114	So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are.
114	This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.
114	I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.
114	Take care.
114	Bill
115	Kate, This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.
115	I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.
115	We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.
115	I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.
115	Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.
115	Boring, but important.
116	Green Room, Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the move to D1.
116	I think better competition will be more fun, provided that we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent basis.
116	I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker and better than myself.
116	So for what it's worth.
116	D1 all the way.
116	Thanks.
117	Group, A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.
117	We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.
117	PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.
117	My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.
117	Then nothing happens.
117	There are two things we need to do to prevent this.
117	One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.
117	Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.
117	Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.
117	Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.
117	Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses Bill
118	I am working on getting Nate's email.
118	I will try to get him to show up at indoor on Monday.
119	Group, I will be out of the office visiting CDWR, SMUD and NCPA on Monday through Wednesday.
119	I should be back Wednesday afternoon.
119	You can reach me on my cell phone if you need.
119	Thanks, Bill
120	Group, We are long on Sunday.
120	15 mws for HE 12-20 at NP15 in PGE3 at $25.
120	I made the deals as DA schedules in CAPS.
120	I have made the purchase from the APX and the sale to imbalance (#685979, #685978).
120	We are long on Monday.
120	Shaped schedule.
120	Price of $35.
120	I have made the purchase from APX and the sale to the imbalance in Enpower (#685980,685981).
120	Schedules are in CAPS under ST-WBOM.
120	Templates have been submitted Day ahead.
120	Please make real-time purchases from the Calimbalance and corresponding sales under ST-WBOM in Enpower during real time.
120	Please call me with questions.
120	503-887-3449 Thanks, Bill
121	Kate, Good morning, hope you had a good weekend.
121	I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.
121	The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS.
121	Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.
121	You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this.
121	I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.
121	Hopefully everything will work.
121	If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.
121	John Anderson will be in at 8.
121	Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.
121	Thanks, Bill
122	Kate, We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.
122	We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.
122	This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.
122	We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.
122	If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.
122	Thanks for the help.
122	Bill
123	Group, Please continue our policy of NOT buying energy from or selling energy to the California Imbalance.
123	I do not feel comfortable with the many risks associated with these transactions at this time (financial, physical, legal, political).
123	Please see me on an individual basis with questions or discussion regarding this.
123	Thanks, Bill
124	Virginia, I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th.
124	ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy.
124	That price is $23 per mw.
124	Please revise the annuity as appropriate.
124	If you have any questions, please come see myself or Mike.
124	Thank you, Bill
125	I am available at any point this morning, including now.
126	Group, We will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).
126	Here is a note of things to remember: ?
126	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.
126	The plant will call with updates periodically.
126	Please record this information in the dispatch log.
126	This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.
126	Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log.
126	The fundamentals site can be found at ?
126	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.
126	That's 353MW @ $5.
126	Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.

126	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403.
126	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.
126	This most likely won't happen.
126	In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.

126	PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS!
126	Thanks, Bill
127	Amy, I added a sentence describing the potential for this position to be temporary.
127	Please see me with any questions.
127	Thanks, Bill
128	Kate, I will not have time today.
128	Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow.
128	Thanks, Bill
129	Just a quick heads up for the flash.
129	Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.
129	For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.
129	We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.
129	This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT.
129	If you have any questions, please let me know.
129	Thanks, Bill
130	I don't know, where you planning on going?
130	If you are, I may not.
130	It depends what is on the agenda.
131	Traci, I manage the short term west hourly trading desk in Portland.
131	Do you need me to come to Houston, or is there a more convenient way to convey my feedback?
131	I also need a performance feedback form.
131	You can reach me at 503-464-3730 Thanks, Bill
132	Greg, I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August.
132	I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV.
132	I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August.
132	NP and SP are currently trading near flat.
132	I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market.
132	I have discussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso.
132	While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels.
132	This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside).
132	I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.
132	If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week.
132	Thanks, Bill
133	If this works for you, please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on.
133	Thanks- Group, We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday.
133	We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.
133	We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.
133	The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).
133	Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.
133	The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.
133	We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.
133	Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.
133	We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).
133	If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me.
133	503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).
133	Thanks, Bill
134	Will do.
134	Thanks
135	After a year in RT...yeah, you could do it...
136	Tim, Per our conversation on Friday regarding the WBOM book, I will limit spreads to 50 with a net of 25 open.
136	If you have any questions or have further feedback, just let me know.
136	Thanks, Bill
137	Kate, We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role.
137	Please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk (ie. collecting pertinent weather information, transmission derates, day-ahead prices, congestion, historical spreads, etc.) and let me know on Monday or Tuesday what we can do.
137	Take your time but have a good weekend.
137	Bill
138	Apparently not.
138	The EPE preschedule sheet had a 25 mw lending position in...
138	We'll have to work with the preschedulers to get it squared away.
139	Kate, EPE will be lending us a schedule for Tuesday, 25 mws at $4 at PV.
139	The schedule will be on peak.
139	Similar to today.
139	Please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct (Friday's sheet for Monday had a duplicate 10 mw schedule in it).
139	Let me know if you have questions.
139	Thanks, Bill
140	Cara, We are short 14 mws at the Portland General System in position manager for Friday, July 20th.
140	HE 5 and HE 6.
140	Pacificorp deal #694155 is not in for those hours.
140	Could you look into this?
140	Thanks, Bill
141	Great.
141	Thanks,
142	Group, I have attached the following cut procedures that should be of benefit as we move into fire season.
142	The sheet is very basic but spells out my expectations for handling a cut.
142	The most important thing to remember is to document everything and call with questions.
142	Thanks, Bill
143	Sounds good.
144	Kate, I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW.
144	Otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive.
145	Heather, On the new deal summary for 07/23/01, I changed the El Paso Electric deal #697528 price from $4 to $68.
145	I should not receive the $25524.54 as revenue shown in the new deal summary.
145	Is there any way to recalculate this (or simply zero it out) prior to the morning flash?
145	Let me know what I can do to help.
145	Thanks, Bill
146	Group, We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.
146	25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.
146	We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.
146	25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.
146	Both schedules are HE 7-22.
146	All deals should be under appropriate books.
146	Please take extra time with the EPE lending.
146	We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.
146	Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.
146	Thanks, Bill
147	Are you kidding me?
147	This is absurd.
148	Group, We have purchased 50 mws from LV Cogen for HE 8, HE 9 and HE 10 at $35.
148	We will need to buy transmission from NEVP from Nevada system to Mead 230 and then into the CAISO for HE 8 thru HE 10.
148	This energy can go towards the ST-CALI and ST-WBOM short in SP-15.
148	I will do enpower for these deals when I arrive in the morning.
148	Remember to give NEVP 2 hours of notice-maybe even 2 and a half...Please call me with any questions.
148	Thanks, Bill
149	Gentlemen, After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.
149	This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.
149	They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's).
149	Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time.
149	Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion.
149	I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.
149	If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.
149	Thanks, Bill
150	Steve, Great email!
150	Arbitrary and capricious indeed.
150	More like ridiculous.
151	Last time I checked, no one could tell the difference.
152	Group, I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.
152	Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.
152	Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.
152	The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.
152	I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.
152	Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.
152	Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.
152	I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.
152	Therefore: We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.
152	Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.
152	Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.
152	Les has provided us with the needed information for each day.
152	Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers.
152	If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.
152	If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know.
152	It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.
152	It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.
152	And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work.
152	This service is a priority and should be treated as such.
152	Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.
152	Thanks, Bill
153	Easy there Gentleman
154	Dave, Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.
154	First, regarding handsets.
154	Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets.
154	Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well.
154	Also, I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret, and on each RT turret as well.
154	Also on Stewart Rosman's, Greg Wolf's, Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's.
154	I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret (this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets).
154	Her TRID is #106 ext.
154	3939, my TRID is #140 ext.
154	3730.
154	I will address our treatment of handsets with the group.
154	Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time.
154	Thanks for the help.
154	Bill
155	I think you know.
156	Group, I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner.
156	Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.
156	These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.
156	If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know.
156	Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.
156	Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out).
156	I feel this goes without saying but maybe...
156	Thanks for your help with this.
156	Bill
157	That sounds good to me.
157	I appreciate your help.
157	Bill
158	Thank you Kate.
159	I would like to get this process going as quickly as possible.
159	Interviews on Thursday?
159	Thanks, Bill
160	We can meet.
160	Who else do we need?
160	Anyone?
161	Sweet.
161	Just grab me after lunch sometime I spose...if that works for you.
162	These look good from my end.
162	Thank you for the update.
162	Bill
163	Group, STWBOM is short tomorrow (07/31/01) on Peak in SP-15.
163	We are short 25 mws at $51.74.
163	STCALI is short 4 mws(?) on peak in SP-15 at $51.74.
163	ST-CALI is long 24 mws off peak at a price of $25.
163	If you have questions, just let me know.
163	Thanks, Bill
164	Leslie, This looks good to me.
164	Thanks for the update.
164	Bill
165	Group, A quick reminder.
165	The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.
165	As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.
165	We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.
165	Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.
165	Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!
165	Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.
165	If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you.
165	Thank you,
166	Group, We will have a real-time meeting on Tuesday August 7th at 4:30PM.
166	The meeting will run till 5:30.
166	We will go over Hourly EOL implementation, Cuts (yet again), new group members, and market changes.
166	Our baseball trip to the suite is Thursday August 16th.
166	Food and beverages will be provided.
166	Finally, reviews are coming.
166	Thanks, Bill
167	Very GOOD!
168	Kate, I would be glad to look at anything you had...
169	When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System.
169	We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.
169	If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.
169	The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.
169	1.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.
169	Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).
169	Enter an offset of .10 .
169	2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.
169	(MIDC to MPC SYS) The transmission fee is $2.52 3.) Go into deal scheduling and query under the counterparty PGE.
169	Select all 4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc. (these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.) 5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS 6.) Finally link the deals.
169	7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.
169	If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.
169	Thanks, Bill
170	Here is your interview schedule for tomorrow.
170	Geir Solberg, Mt.
170	Rainier Conference Room - August 2, 2001 12:00pm-12:45pm - Tom Alonso 12:45pm-1:30pm - Greg Wolfe 1:30pm-2:15pm - Matt Motley
171	After yesterdays cuts there have been some changes in the Colstrip Cut Procedures.
172	The new column on the services sheet regards energy that we may need to market but that is not prescheduled, usually in the off peak hours...Call with any questions.
172	Home number is 503-274-0502 Thanks, Bill
173	Group, When doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks, be sure to put the other desk as the Customer in CAPS.
173	This prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book.
173	Import and Export fees are typically in the nature of $5 per mm on a wheel.
173	Thanks, Bill
174	Pedantic is...
174	1 : of, relating to, or being a pedant 2 : narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously learned 3 : UNIMAGINATIVE, PEDESTRIAN
175	Chuckle, chuckle.
176	Elliot, I have attached the standard PEP review form.
176	The last three categories regarding goal setting and objectives to be acheived still need to be completed.
176	Feel free to add in any comments you might have in other sections as well.
176	I will plan on meeting with Jesse and you early next week.
176	If you have any questions just let me know.
176	Thanks, Bill
177	Group, We will be performing a new service for EES.
177	On Monday, August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load.
177	LADWP will be providing the capacity (SPIN), we will be dispatched over the ADS system, and then need to call the amount into LADWP.
177	We need to keep track of the amount exercised.
177	We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well.
177	The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday.
177	The shape is as follows.
177	Time Volume Tie Point Type HE 7 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 8 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 9 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 10 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 11 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 12 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 13 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 14 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 15 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 16 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 17 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 18 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 19 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 20 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 21 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin HE 22 6 MW LA4-VictorvilleLugo Spin Please call me with any questions.
177	Thanks, Bill
178	Kate, Here is some new info, and some updated info for our packet.
178	Let me know if you have questions.
179	Group, Please join me in a meeting Tuesday at 4:30 in Mt.
179	Hood.
179	We will be discussing strategy and group direction!
179	Pizza will also be in attendance.
179	Thanks,
180	FYI CAISO returns to Primary server.
181	I am not involved with communications...
181	Thanks, Bill
182	Spin was exercised for HE 9 and HE 10 at 08:35 and 09:35 respectively.
183	Yeah, I am taking a look at it.
183	How are the interviews coming?
183	If you want to meet me for lunch, we can grab some pens and go over the thing.
183	I am going to need information from you, and find out what you want to show.
183	Anything good going on this week?
184	Dave, I would like to restrict access to this directory.
184	It is P:\RealTime\ I would like only the members of the real-time group to have access.
184	That is...
184	Ryan Slinger Leaf Harasin Mark Guzman David Porter Bert Meyers Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Kate Symes Todd Bland Casey Anderson Darrin Presto Mike Meier(sp?) as well as...
184	Greg Wolfe Mike Tully Please see me with questions.
184	Thanks, Bill
185	Jim, I just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night.
185	It looks like 28 mws at $198 and 75 mws at $223.00.
185	This should be at total revenue of $22,269.00.
185	Please see me with any questions.
185	Thanks, Bill
186	Thanks!
187	Accused?
187	Easy there.
187	RT is clean.
187	Just like you said...all with the tags and the up and up!
188	Neil, The revenue for the sale that Phil entered to the CAISO will be captured by our volume management group.
188	RT will have no access to this revenue.
188	Consequently, we will not buy or sell it on your behalf to capture it.
188	Please give me a call tomorrow for a more thorough explanation.
188	Thanks, Bill
189	Jim, We have congestion revenue again for 08_07.
189	We moved 272 mws at $194.
189	Total revenue should be $52768.
189	Thanks, Bill
190	Murray, We tally up our exposure each day based on the California flash.
190	Our monthly exposure can be found at P:\RealTime\Exposure\August Exposure.
190	We are keeping a very close eye on it.
190	Thanks,
191	Guys, You can find out the information you need on the website.
191	The website is www.wscc.com, click on certification and training, scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual.
191	Print off the schedulers course manual and study it.
191	You will be tested on the material, a pre-test and a post-test.
191	(note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals).
191	You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course (this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit).
191	Please arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th.
191	Thanks, Bill
192	WAY TO GO BIG!!!
192	Good job...nice accomplishment.
192	Much props!
193	Lisa, Please do not charge EPE the $0.25 scheduling fee on EPE lending or parking with us or ST-SW.
193	Questions?
193	Just ask.
193	Thanks, Bill
194	Jessica, Please remove me from this list.
194	I am not involved with the management of anyone in this pool.
194	Thanks, Bill Williams III
195	Bert, When buying from any desk on the floor, you should have a sale from that desk (say ST-CALI) to either WHourly or WBOM, then do enpower as normal.
195	The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk (another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance, sells to WHourly/WBOM, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE. Please let me know if you have questions. Bill
196	Jim, We recieved congestion relief revenue from the CAISO for Sunday and Monday, August 12th and 13th.
196	Thanks, Bill
197	Kate, We are short 25 mws in SP15 at $43 for Tuesday.
197	I am unsure if ST-CALI is doing anything.
197	We are short 25 mws at PV at @$50 with ST-SW on EPE lending for Tuesday.
197	Let me know if you have questions, and you may want to check prices with these desks.
197	Thanks, Bill
198	Avista put in the 100 mw sale at $70 for HE 1.
198	BPA and CAISO accepted the schedule.
198	I have changed enpower deal #727620 (SCL) to a zero for HE 1, and enpower deal #727622 (Avista) to 250 mws from 150 mws for HE 1.
198	Good work on getting this schedule taken care of.
198	Bill
199	Jim and Darren, We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.
199	We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345.
199	This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report.
199	I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report, these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report.
199	The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift.
199	I prefer to not enter these extra deals.
199	Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists.
199	Thanks, Bill
200	Journalism?
200	Pretty big Enron influence in this article from what I can tell...
200	What are your thoughts?
201	Group, Another update on the situation with California.
201	Check out the letter.
201	Good questions...
202	Guys, We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.
202	Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.
202	Please see me with questions.
202	Thanks, Bill
203	Monika, I have attached your review, for our conference call tomorrow morning at 10 AM Houston time.
203	Talk to you then.
203	Bill
204	A quick heads up.
204	We relieved congestion this morning (08/16/01).
204	The hours and volumes are in the inc sheet.
204	Thanks, Bill
205	Heather, Count me in, I'll buy a bike.

208	There will be a 100 mw schedule delivered at COB to NCPA going on NCPA rights into NP-15.
208	Phil Platter will be scheduling the purchase from NCPA in CAPS and submitting an HA 24 schedule.
208	BE sure to watch what is in your templates in the morning.
208	The ST-NW desk will also be short day-ahead to PGE for Friday and Saturday.
208	Diana will be sending an email.
208	Please call me with questions.
208	Thanks, Bill
209	Kate, We will be short 50 mws off-peak Sunday and Monday(that's all day Sunday and off-peak Monday) at @$36-check with Kysa on price.
209	25 mws on peak Monday at @$45 in SP-15 (check with Kysa) 25 mws on peak Monday at @$50 at PV with EPE (check with Holden) 25 mws off peak at MidC on Monday ONLY at $32 with ST-NW (we will sell to ST-NW--check with Diana S.) Questions?
209	Let me know.
209	Word.
210	Per our conversation on the phone.
210	We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to "personalize" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products.
210	We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15, SP-15, PV, and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20.
210	A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely.
210	Please let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible.
210	Thanks, Bill Williams Short Term West Hourly Trading
211	The delivery points are as follows: And, Products will currently be available for HE 12 through HE 20 Pacific Prevailing Time (PPT), for Monday through Friday.
211	I appreciate the hard work.
211	Thanks, Bill Williams Short Term West Hourly Trading
212	Things have definitely been difficult over here.
212	In truth, I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes.
212	We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow.
212	So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else.
212	She probably just shows it a bit more.
212	We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.
212	My apologies for the delay.
212	Bill
213	You are correct, The EOL trades were not properly acccounted for.
213	I think we have it sorted out now though.
213	But yeah, too much stress is never healthy...I don't know exactly what the deal is.
213	Bill
214	Good morning.
214	We are off in position manager at Mid Columbia because of Enron Canada.
214	I notified Murray at Enron Canada at approximately 6:15 this morning.
214	Position manager is also not working properly, it is reporting a variance at Pacificorp system border ?
214	and at Palo Verde.
214	However the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked.
214	If you have questions, let me know.
214	Thanks, Bill
215	Thanks for the email, I already worked this out with Kal.
215	Bill
216	Group, A quick important reminder.
216	Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing.
216	While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes.
216	The EPE system is not overly complex.
216	If you have questions during a shift call ME first.
216	Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant.
216	Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--).
216	The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2.
216	We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2.
216	Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity.
216	Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met.
216	If you have questions, please see me.
216	We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September.
216	Thanks, Bill
217	Group, Beginning tomorrow, August 25th, we will be scheduling for California on Saturday and Sunday.
217	Serena has put together a training manual outlining the process.
217	The ST-CALI group will be on call to answer any questions or to help us handle cuts.
217	This should be a simple integration into our Saturday and Sunday shifts.
217	Please see me with questions, and be prepared with comments and/or concerns for our meeting the first week of September.
217	Thanks, Bill
218	Sweet.
218	Thanks for the call last night...Brad should be awesome.
218	Where is it at?
218	Let me know how your "evening" with Rachel goes.
218	Bill
219	Dave, Good morning.
219	When you have a chance.
219	We need to get a third turret in the mix at RT.
219	We should use Kate's turret if necessary.
219	Please see me with ideas and or a timeline for getting this installed.
219	Thanks, Bill
220	Group, I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE.
220	As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units.
220	Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.
220	Please call me before you call our customer.
220	Thanks, Bill Correction: The burner problem is on Newman 3.
220	(Thank You! Mr Ward) The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.
220	The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.
220	If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down local units.
220	With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak.
220	Depending on load, GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10 MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...
220	If Market conditions are less than $14.00 BACK DOWN Four Corners...
220	As load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
220	If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!
220	If there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.
220	Any questions or comments please call at 5808 or 915-204-1202...
220	Roger
221	Guys, Good looking discussion note last night.
221	I appreciate the good work.
221	Thanks, Bill
222	Kate, How do I get David removed from schedule crawler?
222	Could you help me with this.
222	Thanks, Bill
223	Kate, This looks good and is well written.
223	Send away.
224	Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay?
224	But what about Nancy...
224	I haven't been to the Breakroom.
224	I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning.
224	I haven't decided yet.
224	I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August--or am I thinking of Chuck.
224	Erica Price?
224	from the dorms, rowed crew, tall, red hair, sometimes slightly neurotic?..that would be kind of fun to run into her, anyway...I'll get back to you when I figure out what the heck is going on.
224	Later.
224	Bill
225	Regarding this.
226	What do you mean adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until you do?
226	Are we correct?
226	If the answer is yes.
226	Tell MPC we are correct, we have checked out with our counterparties (thereby verifying our incredible correctness), but..because we love them so much...we will...this time only...take it in the proverbial shorts.
226	Next time...it will of course...be there turn...
226	Good luck and thanks for your help.
227	Group, EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market!
227	Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations.
227	I do recognize and appreciate the hard work.
227	As always, there is more work to be done.
227	We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice.
227	Some members of the group have experienced limited success, others have experienced little to no success.
227	A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on.
227	So going forward.
227	1.
227	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly.
227	If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal).
227	We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal will not be routed).
227	We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include transmission charges when necessary.
227	In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.
227	2.
227	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
227	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk.
227	Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks.
227	When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export fees.
227	3.
227	A "skeleton" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.
227	Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and immediately input into the service sheet.
227	Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.
227	I would like to implement all of these practices immediately.
227	Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice.
227	Spread the word.
227	I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process.
227	We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement.
227	This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th.
227	Please plan to attend.
227	See me at any time with suggestions or comments.
227	Thanks, Bill
228	How are you?
228	Hope you are doing well.
228	I got your message last night about leaving the NW.
228	Where are you going?
228	When do you take off?
228	Drop me a note if you have a chance.
228	Take care.
228	Bill
229	How about this?
229	Evelyn, Please try to send or copy any emails to me at Williams III, Bill.
229	NOT Williams, Bill.
229	This email went to Bill Williams with Enron who happen to be in Sweden...
229	Kate Symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity.
229	As you may be aware we have recently brought out EnronOnLine to the hourly market.
229	We have seen a dramatic increase in volumes, and priorities have shifted as a result.
229	Daily deadlines must be met.
229	We are working on our deal entry accuracy.
229	I appreciate your patience, we will attend to this issue shortly.
230	There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
230	First-- All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE deal-buy tranny-etc.
230	(I recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have).
230	Consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the ST-NW book.
230	Therefore.
230	An annuity was made from ST-NW to ST-WHOURLY.
230	Deal #531524--$23468.
230	Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #531546).
230	This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70.
230	Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73.
230	All this left RT with a profit of $5399.
230	If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times.
230	These profit share numbers are accurate.
230	After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73.
230	All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February.
230	It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW booQuestions?
230	Just come see me and let me know.
231	Virginia, All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.
231	Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.
231	Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76 Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73 Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).
231	ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.
231	All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.
231	If you have questions, just let me know.
231	Thanks, Bill
232	Darren, Per our discussion, please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group.
232	Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books.
232	My understanding is that Chris will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead (24) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary.
232	All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS.
232	If you have any questions please see me.
232	RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges.
232	Thanks, Bill
233	I have attached the spread sheet I created back in February.
233	There are comments explaining the formulas.
233	If you have questions please just give me a call and I will try to clear them up.
233	Thanks, Bill
234	Group, We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques.
234	We are having great success with EOL so far.
234	For further clarification.
234	1.
234	ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut.
234	For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15.
234	The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW.
234	The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW.
234	2.
234	ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE 3.
234	ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included.
234	We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals.
234	(see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example) 4.
234	INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead 5.
234	WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days.
234	Finally, I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday.
234	You should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449.
234	If you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger, (503) 789-1306.
234	Thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail, Bill
235	Guys, We are short for HE 21 through HE 23 at Malin.
235	We are short at $40.
235	The sale is to Pacificorp Power Marketing.
235	20 mws of the 50 is going to SMUD and 30 mws of the 50 is going to CERS.
235	You can reference tag#'s 31892 and 31889.
235	If you have any questions just give me a call on my cell phone.
235	Thanks, Bill
236	Good email Kate.
236	Nice work.
236	Way to get after "it"!
237	Dave, Thanks for the update and I appreciate the work.
237	I understand that moving turrets, and reconfiguring desks takes time.
237	Just let me know what I can do to help on moving turrets, or changing the RT desk configuration.
237	Thanks, Bill
238	Steve, Can we contact this Steve Johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of California...
238	Funny...I don't remember a "near-meltdown", just inept purchasing and load balancing by CERS at the start of August.
238	CERS is consistently completely out of the market.
238	EVERY DAY!
238	They can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 35,000 mws of load!
238	Humorous article though.
239	Crystal, Seattle was sweet this weekend.
239	I went and saw Brad at the Breakroom...what did you think of Husky Stadium?
239	Woohoo!
239	Man, Thursday...whoa...and think, I went out after that...whoa...but it was my birthday...sorry for calling late.
239	Are you doing anything cool this weekend?
239	Motorcycle dirt track races are on Saturday night at Portland Speedway...
239	I am stoked.
239	Plus the first Husky football game is this weekend in Seattle against Michigan!
239	How are other things going?
239	Hopefully well.
239	Later, Bill
240	Group, Just a quick reminder.
240	When we are notified by the CAISO Generation desk regarding a "waiver" for an Enron managed unit in California, we should notify the services desk if it is during the day, and should email the services desk (and me) if it is after normal work hours.
240	If you have questions please just let me know.
240	Thanks, Bill
241	Group, A quick reminder.
241	After reviewing this weekend, we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at ALL tie points.
241	We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15, the COI and NOB.
241	We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions.
241	It is still fire season, and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions.
241	Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site, and spend the time to manage our congestion risk.
241	If you have questions, please ask.
241	We need everyone up to speed on this quickly.
241	Thanks, Bill
242	Stewart, I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
242	But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
242	Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st?
242	Could they come the morning of the 19th?
242	Let's get together and talk regardless.
242	Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
242	Thanks, Bill
243	Holly, I think you have the wrong Bill Williams.
243	I am in Portland and am not involved with card access.
243	Thanks, Bill
244	Dave, Any word from PGE regarding a phone for Kate?
244	Anything I can do to help?
244	Just let me know.
244	Thanks, Bill
245	Amy, Could you please sign up Bert Meyers, Mark Guzman, and Kate Symes for the pilot program.
245	Thanks, Bill
246	You may want to take a look at this.
247	Sophie, I think you have the wrong Bill Williams as I do not work in Houston or know Erin Copeland.
247	Please remove me from your distribution list.
247	Thanks, Bill
248	Group, A quick reminder.
248	The night shift will average the sales price and make one strip for the on-peak piece.(so ST-WBOM will sell to ST-Whourly at x$ for HE7-22 then ST-Whourly does whatever it needs to do).
248	If you have questions just let me know.
248	Thanks, Bill
249	David, I have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with Amy Fitzpatrick in our HR department.
249	Obviously this is a loose plan (the headcount for the RT group changes frequently)...but it should prove a bit more accurate than nothing.
249	If you have any questions please just let me know.
249	You can call me here at work at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.
249	Thanks, Bill
250	Darin, I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities.
250	I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort.
250	A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread.
250	If you have any questions, just let me know.
250	Otherwise keep up the good work!
250	Thanks, Bill
251	Stewart, Just a quick heads up.
251	SMUD used enron online today and sold ust a total of 125 mws.
251	Thanks for the good work!
251	Bill
252	Group, We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.
252	Please use appropriate dollar and mw values.
252	Below is JUST an example.
252	When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.
252	*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE* Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.
252	Thanks, Bill
253	Jill, I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs.
253	I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan.
253	Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone.
253	If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.
253	Thanks, Bill
254	Jill, Could you also cancel my monthly PalmNet service.
254	Thanks, Bill
255	Absolutely, Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month.
255	Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).
255	Let's put this in effect by October.
255	I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones? Thanks, Bill
256	Jill, I was being sarcastic about the $16000.
256	Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months (AT&T should have this info).
256	If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well.
256	I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent.
256	I appreciate the help.
256	Thanks, Bill
257	Jill, Ryan Slinger previously had a plan set up.
257	It looks like our AT&T rep switched him back to the group calling plan.
257	Please check with Ryan and he will let you know what he needs.
257	Thanks, Bill
258	Group, Please remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet.
258	Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO.
258	Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet.
258	This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes.
258	Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag.
258	Thanks, Bill
259	Cindy, Please remove my name from whatever list you might have.
259	I work in Portland and am not involved with security clearance or security access.
259	Thanks, Bill
260	Dave, I have attached a revised budget forecast for 2002.
260	The 2002 headcount (column D) is now correct at the top of the budget.
260	I do not have a number from David Steiner yet regarding technology costs (row 107) but I am expecting it soon.
260	Everything else is pretty much as you and I discussed earlier today.
260	Please call me with any questions.
260	Thank you for the help.
260	Bill
261	Cindy, Please...remove me from your list.
261	I am not involved with security, in Houston or otherwise, and can not help you obtain a security badge.
261	Bill
262	ate, You should recieve an email from Sean Crandall detailing a short position for tomorrow (Saturday) and for Monday.
262	Please give this information to the group including Enpower information...etc.
262	Call me if you have any questions.
262	Thanks, Bill
263	Group, Please take a look at the following attachment.
263	It details how we will be entering our Enpower and CAPS 99% of the time.
263	If you have any questions, just let me know.

265	Schedule changes need to be communicated for obvious reasons.
265	Thanks, Bill
266	What do you guys think?
267	Group, When tiering adjustment bids, the CAISO system will not read more than 10 bids.
267	Also, remember to have the tier monotically increasing.
267	Thanks, Bill
268	Here is the original email from Keoni, and the follow-up from Chris Foster.
268	Just give me a call with any questions.
268	Thanks, Bill

272	Of course you were.
272	Don't feel bad though, we all get confused at times.
272	Some of us just more than others.
273	This is relatively irrelavent but thought you might enjoy it...of course...it is made up...just like everything else forwarded on the internet none of these people actually exist...
274	Darren, Just let me know when you have time and we will set it up.
275	Paul, Thanks for the invitation but I will not be able to attend on Friday.
275	Bill
276	Yes...sorry about implying that you did not have approval...
277	Group, Here is some more inforation regarding taking care of Canada this weekend.
277	Bill
278	You should be receiving an email regarding access to EOL.
278	If you have any questions about getting set up just let me know.
278	Bill
279	This all looks good.
279	The real time phone number is 1-800-684-1336...
279	Thanks for the hard work.
279	Bill
280	Bert, I would like some of these folks to attend the Energy Math class on the 8th of November.
280	Please schedule 4 or 5 of them to go if possible.
280	Thanks, Bill
281	NO!!!!
281	You must live with gross tooth decay and bleeding gums.
281	Yellow teeth and excessive plaque build-up are expected in Real-Time...
282	Yes...that is correct.
283	Chip, Could you send me a list of Turret ID's for the guys in the real-time group.
283	I would like to lead a push to have everyone in the group update their turret and customize it for their own use.
283	Thanks, Bill
284	Michael, I think you intended to send this to Bill Williams in Technical Assets.
284	Please note the difference in addresses and make the change.
284	Thanks, Bill
285	I don't know...
286	Bob, We would have the following hourly physical products out until 6 PM CST (4 PST) on Friday--HE 17 through HE 20 Palo Verde; HE 17 through HE 20 MID-C; HE 19 through HE 20 SP15; HE 19 through HE 20 NP15.
286	We can then suspend or inactivate these products at 6 PM.
286	All other physical products will have already been suspended or inactivated before 6 PM CST (HE 12 through HE 17 etc.).
286	If you have any questions, please let me know.
286	Thank you for the help.
286	Bill
287	Jeff, I will be glad to discuss this with you in the future.
287	However, I am on my way out the door to Pullman, WA for a recruiting trip.
287	I will be back late on Friday afternoon or we can talk on Monday.
287	Give me a call on my cell and let me know what you would like to do.
287	Bill
288	I will be out of the office from Wednesday through Friday.
288	Please refer trading questions to Ryan Slinger or call me on my cell phone...503-887-3449.

290	ALLEGHENY ENERGY SUPPLY Scheduling Coordinator ID-- *****New ID is APX5******
291	Paul could likely do this, it does require a ton of hard work and is a difficult job.
292	Group, Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices...
292	BPA non-firm point to point (or network) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity.
292	Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26 Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB-- SNOPud is charging $3.25 for point to point plus 1.9% losses.
292	Bill
293	Bert, I put all the names in a hat...and you are the man...please revise the schedule and redistribute it with yourself attending the trip...
293	Enjoy!
294	I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you.
294	Maybe an early afternoon brew...
294	Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire.
295	That's right, I forgot about QOTSA.
295	Did you enjoy that CD?
295	Your dad is coming in today to see the trading floor and then we are going to grab some lunch and talk about what we do here at the big E. I fly out at 4 on Friday afternoon...
295	I guess Nikki is coming to Portland at the end of October...oh-oh.
296	Todd, From an information standpoint this looks good.
296	I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts.
296	You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron.
296	The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
296	If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
296	Thanks, Bill
297	What?
297	Is receiving an email at 1:30 too late?
297	Just because everything is done by 10...At least NW is on the right side of the market...oh wait...their not...doh!
297	And looks like today was a bad day to go short...but who's counting?
298	I will be out of the office visiting El Paso Electric and PNM through Friday evening.
298	Please see Ryan with any questions regarding trading.
298	I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.
298	Thanks, Bill
299	Thank you Kate, Nice work.
299	Bill
300	Chip have you had a chance to work with Greg Ford on ADS?
300	Any ideas on the new ADS phase II?
300	Thanks, Bill
301	Darren, Could you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05?
301	We had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS.
301	The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18.
301	We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18.
301	Both wheels were awarded at $54.90.
301	We should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels.
301	Please give me a shout with questions.
301	Thanks, Bill
302	Thanks Kysa.
302	Nice work.
303	John, Thank you for the letter and for the resume.
303	I will be putting them in front of Julie Kearney in our HR department and will be getting the process started.
303	I am still waiting to see exactly what the needs for my group will be, but should have a better idea in a few days.
303	I will be in touch.
303	Bill
304	Catherine, I believe this was meant for Bill Williams in Technical Assets.
304	Please note the difference in email addresses.
304	Thanks, Bill
305	No problem.
306	Actually, I think the Honda is probably the one.
306	Much cooler...and good Honda reliability.
306	Looks good in Silver or Red.
306	Bill
307	The CBR 945 RR is a bit sweeter, cheaper, better looking and has Honda reliability...
307	Oooohhh.
307	Nice.
307	Bill
308	Great to hear from you.
308	I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet.
308	Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me.
308	It should be good for our stock price though.
308	One can hope anyway.
308	Glad to hear you guys are doing well.
308	Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer.
308	You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
308	And my liver will likely always be in shape.
308	Take care.
309	Sandra, Please update your email list to read Bill Williams and not Bill Williams III.
309	Thank you,
310	Thank you for the email.
310	Bill
311	Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
311	I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.
311	I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus.
311	For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws.
311	I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.
311	I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.
311	I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.
311	I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.
311	I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them.
311	I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back.
311	I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them.
311	At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission.
311	SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.
311	I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.
311	I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
311	Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.
311	At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
311	I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time.
311	SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13.
311	I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him.
311	He told me he would call his marketer.
311	While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.
311	I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end.
311	It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him.
311	I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.
311	My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO.
311	Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice.
311	If you have any questions for me please let me know.
311	Thank you for your help.
311	Bill
312	John, Goodness!
312	Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse.
312	First, I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department.
312	I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work), and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift.
312	One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move.
312	Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week.
312	So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there.
312	I have answered a few of your questions in your email below.
312	We can go over the others when we speak next.
312	Thanks for the good questions.
312	Bill
313	Sean, Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west.
313	Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback.
313	Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us?
313	Let me know, Bill
314	Group- WWP is good to buy and sell with us again.
314	Have fun.
314	Bill
315	Steve, Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email.
315	Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it.
315	I understand we may not implement it for a while.
315	However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down.
315	I appreciate your time and feedback.
315	Thank you, Bill
316	What is this ZP-15?
317	My apologies for the public humiliation.
317	Bill
318	Kate, We are short 2 pieces of BOM at SP-15 7-22.
318	Price of $27.20 and $28.00.
318	We are also short 1 daily piece in SP-15 at the ST-CALI index price.
318	Thanks, Bill
319	Group, We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months.
319	First: With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp.
319	We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage.
319	As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back.
319	Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market.
319	Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group.
319	We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers.
319	I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible.
319	Second: The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest.
319	It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10.
319	We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC.
319	Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20.
319	Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours.
319	Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC.
319	Finally: We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.
319	Please see me with any questions regarding the system.
319	Thank you.
319	Bill
320	Paul, Here is an updated version of the agreement I sent to Steve on Friday.
320	Sorry I didn't cc you to start with.
320	It's pretty much exactly as we discussed.
320	Let me know if you have any questions.
320	Thanks, Bill
321	Group, Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General.
321	We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System.
321	OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C.
321	PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled.
321	Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point.
321	In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.
321	We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request.
321	Please see me with any questions.
321	Thanks, Bill
322	Kate, We are short 3 pieces tomorrow at $27.20, $28.00, and a piece at the ST-CALI index.
322	We are also long HE2 through HE5 at PV, 20 mws parked with PNM at $16.
322	Deal #'s are-823620, 823657--we will be out in position manager for these hours...BW
323	Group, David Porter will be moving to the Utility Risk Management group with Enron Energy Services beginning Tuesday October 23.
323	Please join me in thanking David for his effort in the real-time group over the past year (especially the 24-hour long shift), and wishing him good luck in his new position.
323	Stay tuned for a "going away" party for Dave in the near future.
323	Bill
324	I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's.
324	I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect.
324	We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids.
324	However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed.
324	I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.
324	Please give me a call when you have a chance.
324	Thanks, Bill
325	Kysers and Mary- ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday.
325	The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50.
325	The deal number is 826094.
325	This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday.
325	Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60.
325	You would have the deal numbers on this one.
325	Sweet.
326	Tim, Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager to work with both FSP and Enpower.
326	David Poston showed the position manager to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter.
326	Dave suggested that the new position manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAPS and Enpower.
326	When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told that the East desk had driven most of the development work to date.
326	The functionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed useful, with little development needed for us to implement it.
326	The position manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's current position and report reconciliation methods.
326	My impression of the application was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not a stand alone application.
326	Within a week after demostrating the new position manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would be delayed until after FSP was in production.
326	As a result of the FSP delay, I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it since that first meeting.
326	I think this application (as I saw it last) has the potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them.
326	This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal control.
326	Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the real-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.
326	If you have any questions please let me know.
326	Thanks, Bill
327	Group, Our deal with EES has changed.
327	As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to 200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.
327	However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws.
327	I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs.
327	This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.
327	Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border.
327	This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax.
327	Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy.
327	We need to treat EnMax just like ECC.
327	We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option.
327	MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.
327	Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived.
327	The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...
327	Any questions, just let me know.
327	Thanks, Bill
328	Group, Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system.
328	I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect.
328	Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service.
328	Thanks, Bill
329	St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50.
329	We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80.
329	Same deal # as yesterday--#826094.
329	If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it.
329	Remember, we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60 Sweet.
330	Kathy, I will be available on Tuesday but it would have to be either earlier or later on in the day.
330	I could meet with Britt at 3PM or at 9 AM.
330	Any idea what this is regarding?
330	Thanks, Bill
331	What are Tracy's thoughts on this?
332	Group, For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested.
332	The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning.
332	Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed.
332	I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8.
332	This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.
332	Bill
333	Group, Also on Saturday morning...Enpower will be down from 5 AM to 7 AM.
333	Thanks, Bill
334	We also received congestion for HE 5--50 mws at $74.83.
334	HE 5 is not in the inc sheet but will be.
334	The CISO is again having difficulties reading our bids.
334	They have been working on this for a week.
334	Thanks, Bill
335	Group, The Enron Derivatives II will be on Wednesday and Thursday, November 14th and 15th.
335	The class is open to those who took Derivatives I earlier this year.
335	Please see me or send me an email if you are interested and we will make scheduling arrangements.
335	Thanks, Bill
336	Cool
337	Julie, I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington.
337	Do you still want some to go to Seattle and stir up interest?
337	Bill
338	When will you be starting your subscription to "Bear Magazine"?
339	Definitely...to begin with he should be Michael Mier.
339	Let me know what you need...
339	Bill
340	Kate, It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times.
340	Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it.
340	We have in the past discussed that I would prefer that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week.
340	If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
340	I appreciate your understanding.
340	Bill
341	If you need tomorrow and Friday off, take it.
342	Take these days off too.
343	Alan, I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
343	1.
343	Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials) 2.
343	The CISO Table 1.
343	lists an unintended consequence as " Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver" Why is there no obligation to deliver?
343	3.
343	Is there still a load deviation penalty?
343	Or would that be considered seperately?
343	Thanks for the help.
343	Bill
344	Group, We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.
344	For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule).
344	I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25.
344	We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result.
344	Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short).
344	I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone.
344	Do call with questions.
344	Cell: 503-887-3449 Home: 503-274-0502 Thanks, Bill
345	I still need to interview Stacy but will have feedback when I finish.
345	Thanks, Bill
346	Group, As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday.
346	We are back in Pacific Standard Time.
346	As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties.
346	Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary.
346	We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them.
346	See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.
346	Thanks, Bill
347	You can go ahead and talk to Fran...Also, how was you vaca?
347	And I have some things for you to take care of from Thursday and this weekend when you have a chance.
347	Thanks,
348	Just talked with Kochel.
348	He was expecting a bounce in our stock on funds covering their shorts.
348	I don't know if I agree after this.
348	Bill
349	Kate, Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day.
349	I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control.
349	She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45.
349	I am not sure where I am at on this index, your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index.
349	Sorry for the short notice.
349	Bill
350	Matt, I will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas...
350	BTW-I heard from Kochel this morning, he is getting married March 2nd in Seattle--did you know his sister was already married to Steve Darue?
350	(poor woman!).
350	The Kelso/Camas game is on Thursday--maybe I will take Friday off...what do you think?
350	Check your hotmail around 3.
351	Kochel is supposed to get married on March 2nd.
351	Same girl--we'll see if its the same outcome.
352	Matt, I like the Mcleod Resume the best.
352	I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback.
352	Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again.
352	It looks like you have a good start.
352	I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them.
352	Good luck.
352	Bill
353	Ken, Thank you for your inquiry.
353	I will do my best to answer your questions, but would prefer to answer your questions by phone.
353	I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions.
353	I will usually be most available after 3 each day.
353	You can reach me at 503-464-3730.
353	Thanks, Bill
354	Group- Brace yourselves...
354	Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes.
354	The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19.
354	These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp.
354	Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp.
354	Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp.
354	We should not suck off the grid.
354	Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW.
354	We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it.
354	We should be using congestion wheels as hedges.
354	A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief.
354	We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30.
354	Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling.
354	Any questions?
354	Comments?
354	Ideas?
354	Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.
354	Thanks, Bill
355	Group, A quick reminder.
355	All El Paso Electric Deals and related deals for El Paso Electric (ie buying from SRP selling to EPE--anything with a group of EPEC in Enpower) need to be in MST.
355	These deals should be scheduled in MST on the deal scheduling portion of Enpower as well.
355	Thanks, Bill
356	Josie, Sign me up.
356	Thanks, Bill
357	Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90?
357	My impression is that this was totally trued up...
357	Is this some weird tranny charge?
357	Ideas...
357	As always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month.
357	Thanks, Bill
358	Super.
358	And sorry about getting you locked in the stairwell.
358	I just
359	Thanks, And sorry again about the stairwell--did you actually get stuck in there?
360	This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional.
360	In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display Enron's core values: Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.
360	I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team.
360	Please see what you can do to better respect Kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day.
361	Darin, I need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and Kate Symes.
361	Please do NOT send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--El Paso or others.
361	Also, my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com.
361	I appreciate the email, but I had to receive it from our customer.
361	Let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on Sunday or Monday morning.
361	Give me a call on my cell phone on Saturday when you have a chance.
361	Thanks, Bill
362	Cara, Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry.
362	Hopefully it still works for you guys.
362	Did you want to get rooms as well.
362	If so just speak with Jill Chatterton.
362	More to follow.
363	Pretty much, its turning into the only day they have available for what we need...short of Thanksgiving weekend or late December...which is getting a bit close to the Holidays...
363	What do you think?
363	Is it a good way to end the month?
364	This is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down.
364	Also...
364	Right after the boxes, but parallel to FSP parallel testing.
364	Thanks, Bill
365	Chip, Could you help me put Enpower on my local computer?
365	And my monitor keeps sleeping on the job.
365	Thanks, Bill
366	Guys, When you see Four Corners #5 come back tonight.
366	Please use the fundies website to send out a message confirming it to Traders and RT.
366	Also, you should give BPA and CERS a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap power.
366	Also, we are long 50mws flat at PV (see Kate's email)...The prices are $27 and $37.
366	Feel free to sell off up to HE 17 at around 39...if you can get 43 bal peak--go for it!!!
366	We sold 50's across the peak at PV tonight.
366	This was a result of the Four Corners 5 derate so prices may fall hard tomorrow.
366	Please try to find some information on the status of SouthPoint and the Desert Basin unit tonight as well (this used to be Reliant's plant --rumor has it this is now SRP's starting tomorrow).
366	As a bonus, CalPine scheduled off of SouthPoint for tomorrow while the plant was still down for maitenence...If you get cut--sell them the off peak at PV for $75...MAKE THEM WEAR IT!
366	As an added bonus don't forget LADWP and CORAL cut us off for "credit reasons"...please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpartFinally, Services has a new deal with a cement company in NP-15.
366	We will liquidate the energy for the Services Desk RT at NP-15 +/- $2.
366	We need to make a buy/sell from imbalance under Services at $0 price.
366	We then make a buy/sell from Services under St-Whourly at NP-15 +/- $2.
366	Finally we buy/sell from/to Counterparty X under the St-Whourly book.
366	Then we need to give Services the swap deal # and the price.
366	The mw values should be on Kysa's sheet.
366	If this procedure works...please send out an email detailing the procedure with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical.
366	Have fun and good luck.
366	Thanks, Bill
367	Group-- NO TRADES WITH SEMPRA UNTIL FURTHER.
367	Do not sell to them, do not buy from them.
367	They are in a box.
367	You may want to let the muni's and other counterparties know.
367	Call me with questions.
367	Thanks, Bill
368	Group,.
368	I will be out of the office on Friday November 2nd, I will return on Monday November 5th.
368	If you have questions, please call me on my phone at 503-887-3449.
368	Thanks, Bill
369	Matt, Check this out, we got this from our managing director this morning...So is the Fremont bridge a target...how bout the I-5?
369	Might want to pass this on to your mom and dad.
369	By the way--your a wuss for skipping the high school playoff game...
369	This just came to me today.
369	This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.
369	It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.
369	This is all the information that is available.
369	Enron Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.
369	While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.
369	THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.
369	REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.
369	SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
369	THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.
369	RECIPIENTS WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.
369	RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.
369	We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.
369	Thank you.
370	Is the bet that I will reject the idea?
371	Diana, Here is the message that Kate sent to Diane, and the original messages from Diane are below that.
371	I think we will have this sorted out going forward.
371	Let me know if you have any questions.
371	Thanks, Bill
372	Traders are as follows: Bill Williams III Ryan Slinger Kate Symes Bert Meyers Leaf Harasin Mark Guzman Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Casey Anderson Darrin Presto Mike Meier Thanks for making sure this is squared away, Bill
373	Murray, Thank you for your interest in our group.
373	I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening.
373	We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time).
373	As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move.
373	Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.
373	Bill
374	I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem.
374	I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids.
374	The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed.
374	Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids.
374	Will the change in running the "solutions" change this?
374	Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly.
374	I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.
374	Thanks, Bill
375	A truly useful fount of knowledge...
376	We will not be needing any headsets in the real-time group...
376	Thanks for checking.
376	Bill
377	This is appropriate--do not make the Enpower till the next day if it will be under St-Whourly....
378	This was meant for you.
379	This should go to Bill Williams.
379	Not Bill Williams IIII.
380	I already do.
381	I am sorry to hear this Julie.
381	I appreciate your effort and do not envy your task of informing the candidates of our change in plans.
381	Let me know if there is anything I can help with.
381	Bill
382	One more index.
382	This is the one I would like to participate in...if it works.
382	Bill
383	Group, We have returned to CAPS as of today.
383	We will return to running the Enpower to CAPS report as usual.
383	This will give us a chance to work the performance bugs out of FSP and improve our reconciliation methodology at the same time.
383	Thanks, Bill
384	Check this sick stuff out.
385	ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230.
385	I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15.
385	I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.
385	ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25.
385	Chris Mallory brokered this deal.
385	Thanks Bill
386	Group, We all knew it was coming.
386	NERC Compliance surveys are continuining.
386	Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load.
386	THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST.
386	Templates and POR/POD sheets are available.
386	If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know.
386	Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th.
386	Thanks, Bill
387	Dude-- It was $5.
387	My total bet for the game was $40.
387	$5 to you, $20 to Porter, $15 to Mark Fisher.
387	Come on...don't try to run me over.
387	The gloating has to be worth $5.
388	Of course.
388	Deez nuts.
389	Group, We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3.
389	We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5.
389	This cost us $7.50.
389	We imported it from MEAD 230.
389	We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25.
389	This is from Redding.
389	Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead.
389	You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased.
389	If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased.
389	We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.
389	Thanks, Bill
390	Good afternoon.
390	We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13.
390	Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning.
390	The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.
390	Thanks, Bill
391	Extra ST-SW transmission can be viewed in the Available Transmission Sheet.
392	I know Jim.
392	You guys are doing well.
392	Thanks, Bill
393	Amy, Hey!
393	Great to hear from you!
393	Hope you are doing well.
393	But...
393	What are you talking about?
393	Who's on what side?
393	And what are you trying to recall?
393	Bill
394	Jill, Could you look into my concur expense login/password.
394	I am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system.
394	However,I cannot access the system.
394	I am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what.
394	Also, we are a go for Edgefield.
394	You and I just need to talk about the expense report.
394	Thanks, Bill
395	Jim, We also received congestion revenue for HE 10 through HE 18.
395	HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site (their server went down) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line.
395	Thanks, Bill
396	Jim, You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet.
396	This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section.
396	My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning.
396	You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet.
396	If you have any questions just let me know.
396	Thanks, Bill
397	Group, We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday.
397	I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals.
397	Please pay special attention to #5 below.
397	So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.
397	1.
397	EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method) 2.
397	We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.
397	3.
397	EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions.
397	Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.
397	4.
397	EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone.
397	Good delivery points would be: Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.
397	Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.
397	5.
397	IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO.
397	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four Corners would be appropriate.
397	For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to Four Corners.
397	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15.
397	This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move to FSP.
397	6.
397	We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.
397	Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports.
397	Please see me with any questions.
397	Thanks, Bill
398	Group, We will have an emergency meeting on Monday, November 26th at 4 PM.
398	We will be going live on EOL for HE 7-22 on Monday.
398	We will be discussing EOL trading, the new confirmation workspace in Enpower, business practice changes, and the Dynegy merger.
398	Please make plans to attend.
398	Contact me as soon as you can if you think you may not be able to make it.
398	Thanks, Bill
399	Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use.
399	A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail.
399	You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward.
399	You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night.
399	This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp.
399	Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP).
399	These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21.
399	NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login.
399	Following are a few pointers to help you get started.
399	1.
399	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation.
399	This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools."
399	2.
399	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk.
399	Choose "West" and click "Okay."
399	3.
399	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
399	4.
399	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by.
399	Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls.
399	When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule 5.
399	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen.
399	Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows.
399	6.
399	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon.
399	A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty.
399	Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
399	7.
399	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon.
399	A screen called "Cut Information" will come up.
399	Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.) 8.
399	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule.
399	This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.
399	Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes.
399	These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)
400	Tim, I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West.
400	I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex.
400	I am considering participating with Dow Jones.
400	I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time.
400	It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks.
400	I am working with Kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index.
400	I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to Steve Hall when they arrive.
400	I have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on EOL to our counterparties.
400	I would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity.
400	Thanks, Bill
401	I appreciate the goals and accomplishments, I was looking more for a quick outline of duties.
401	This should work though.
401	Thanks, Bill
402	I like that much better...super.
403	Good morning, I would like to obtain Global Trader ID's for the following traders on the Short Term West Hourly desk in Portland, Oregon.
403	They will be using EnronOnline beginning next week, Nov. 26th.
403	Bert Meyers Mark Guzman Leaf Harasin Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Please call me with any questions.
403	I can be reached at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.
403	Thank you for your help.
403	Bill Williams
404	Just wanted to give you a quick heads up.
405	Grace, What is a CPE certificate?
406	Allegheny's SC is now APX 5.
406	Contact numbers are below.
406	Thanks Bill
407	Susan, Thank you.
407	This looks good.
407	To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal.
407	Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded.
407	Thanks, Bill
408	Thanks for reserving the room.
408	I will not need any food ordered.
408	Thanks, Bill
409	Group- We are currently owed money by CERS (approximately $100,000).
409	We need to net this to a zero by Friday.
409	It is very important that each of you call CERS and purchase energy from them to net this position out.
409	Otherwise--we will see a loss of $100,000.
409	Let's make this problem go away.
409	Thanks, Bill
410	I have also not been able to approve these.
410	I do need those folks to have access...
411	I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26.
411	We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD.
411	Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws.
411	I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064.
411	I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred.
411	Please let me know if you have any questions.
411	Bill
412	Nope.
413	Group, Cuts are on the way.
413	While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day.
413	In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below.
413	We will be handling cuts in the following manner: 1.
413	Documentation is priority #1.
413	We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.
413	2.
413	After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.
413	3.
413	We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity.
413	The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule.
413	The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract.
413	In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).
413	4.
413	Please be as accurate as possible.
413	We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day.
413	And we still need to calculate our daily position.
413	5.
413	Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk.
413	I appreciate your help and diligence.
413	Thanks, Bill
414	Group, As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended.
414	For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.
414	Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission.
414	Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws.
414	But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest.
414	These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.
414	Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.
414	Thanks, Bill
415	Dave, I need your help with some Enpower applications.
415	Please give me a call as soon as you have an opportunity.
415	By the way...I sure hope your Longhorns do NOT end up matched against my Huskies...ouch!
415	Thanks, Bill
416	This is important---
417	For all cuts the following procedures apply...
417	1.) Notes as usual 2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms.
417	Enter comments in the confirmed section.
417	We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).
417	3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us.
417	Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's."
417	4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by.
417	For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws).
417	If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws.
417	THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
417	We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.
417	Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us.
417	25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule.
417	Stacy has set this up at PV.
417	Please do this as a direct bill with EPE.
417	As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE.
417	Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.
417	This will probably not be a fun weekend.
417	I appreciate your help.
417	Bill
418	Group- As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique.
418	(YES!) 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" (this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.
418	2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING.
418	On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).
418	IF you have any questions, please call me.
418	We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.
418	Thanks, Bill
419	The key is to go long Heroin and Coke when you have a chance.
419	And put extra money in the bank Bill
420	This can also be found at P:Realtime/Williamsonly/Dopewars in the P drive.
420	If you have access.
421	What up dawg!
421	How are you and Meg doing?
421	I still have a job.
421	It has been an extremely rocky time.
421	However, I feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion.
421	I believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again.
421	The chances are good that I will have to thin out my group a bit, I am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group.
421	I think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave.
421	Hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs I will have to do.
421	It would suck having to lay-off good people.
421	Its worrisome but like I said, I am optimistic.
421	Soccer was going well, but I sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night, so another two-three weeks before I am out there playing again...bollocks!
421	Its ridiculous.
421	How are things with you?
421	I have two tickets to Mark Lanegan on December 19th at Berbatis Pan.
421	Are you going to be in town at that point?
421	Its gonna be sweet.
421	Still enjoying the Audi.
421	My address is 1005 SW Park Ave.
421	#706, Portland OR, 97205.
421	Give me a ring and let me know what the word is.
421	503-887-3449.
421	Later, Bill
422	Sorry to hear it man.
422	It has not been a great last couple of months.
423	Bam.
423	Let me know what you hear
424	Thank you.
425	Group, We will be meeting on Thursday at 4:30 to discuss recent changes and the company outlook with Tim on Thursday Dec. 13th at 4:30.
425	Please call me if you cannot make it.
425	Thanks, Bill
426	Sean, Just to follow-up from yesterday.
426	Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power "consulting" agreement).
426	Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two.
426	As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.
426	Ideas?
426	Bill
427	Good morning, We have had some changes in our real-time group at Enron and consequently I would like to request a password change for the following EPMI logins.
427	Please notify me when these changes will be effective.
427	1.) real_time_epmiwe-- the current password is epmishift, I would like to change it to: huskies 2.) real_time_epmiwe2-- the current password is realtimers2, I would like to change it to: ducks 3.) real_time_epmiwe3-- the current password is oregon, I would like to change it to: beavers 4.) settlements-- the current password is settlements, I would like to change it to: cougars Thank you for your help with this.
427	Bill Williams Manager, Short Term West Hourly Trading
428	I'm sorry I missed your call.
428	I know you are busy but please let me know when you have something.
428	Leaf called yesterday looking for clarification and I would like to be able to give him an answer.
428	Thanks, Bill
429	Thank you for the confirmation.
429	That is very good news.
430	Alan, I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you.
430	Eric Linder and Steve Merriss.
430	Their home numbers are 503-753-8716 and 503-241-3729 respectively.
430	Both had worked for me for about 8-9 months.
430	These are the only numbers I have for them as their cell phones have been canceled.
430	Bill
431	Jason, Good afternoon.
431	I am contacting you regarding activating a pass to the Employee Store.
431	I did product testing for you in late spring (for soccer).
431	I would like to activate the pass for tomorrow, December 14th, if possible.
431	I recognize this is short notice but if this would be possible please give me a call back at 503-887-3449.
431	I would like to have my parents attend as well.
431	Their names are Bill and Joy Williams.
431	I appreciate your help.
431	Thanks, Bill Williams
432	I can be a reference for both Eric and Steve.
433	Good morning!
433	How are you doing?
433	It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever.
433	Things are going well here in Portland.
433	The bankruptcy of Enron has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity.
433	If we are bought out, we should be back up and running by early spring.
433	Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again.
433	Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast.
433	I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping.
433	I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there.
433	I am thinking about coming up for New Year's...
433	any good ideas?
433	Anyway, hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays.
433	Take care, Bill
434	Stewart and Paul, I have heard that MPC has contracted with Avista to do their load balancing.
434	Has anyone contacted MPC to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future.
434	MPC is likely month-to-month with Avista as they were with us.
434	Has there been any progress with EPE?
434	What are your expectations for retaining them?
434	Of all our service customers these would be the only two I am truly concerned about getting back.
434	I think we have seen significant revenue from both, more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures.
434	Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there is anything I can do to assist.
434	Thanks, Bill
435	JMF cell number 1-713-412-7529...
436	Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis, and Den of Thieves.
436	Good stuff.
436	He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish.
436	I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch Is Enron the New Drexel?
436	By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.'' Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true.
436	The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers.
436	The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press.
436	Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company!
436	And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie.
436	Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one.
436	Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it.
436	But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay.
436	Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them.
436	And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust.
436	Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal.
436	But the morality of the cases are entirely different.
436	Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves.
436	There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones.
436	He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm.
436	He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it.
436	The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag.
436	Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was.
436	Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked.
436	What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits.
436	What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses.
436	(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel.
436	In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business.
436	In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense.
436	In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story.
436	In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top.
436	Anything is possible.
437	Good morning, Hope you had a great holiday!
437	Bill
438	Group, We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports.
438	If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS.
438	After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report.
438	If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours.
438	Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually.
438	Once all the finals are in the load zones and int.
438	interchanges, you should be able to create the final report.
438	Please give me a call if you have any questions.
438	Thanks, Bill
439	**Per Tony at EPE, the following is new for 2002.
439	I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.** First, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.
439	The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP.
439	Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.
439	Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the Eddy tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC.
439	Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.
439	**The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo.
439	25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ.
439	and can be varied by PNM each hour.** Please ask if you have any questions.
439	Thanks, Bill
440	Good morning.
440	Hope your new year is off to a great start!
441	Scotty, What's up?
441	Checking to see if this was your email or not?
441	Haven't heard from you in forever.
441	Hope you had a good new year.
441	Drop me a line and give me the word.
441	Bill
442	Scott, I had not heard from you in a while and was wandering what you might be up to?
442	Still in Seattle?
442	Coming down to Portland anytime soon?
442	Let me know.
442	word.
443	Alan, I think you have identified the most pressing issues.
443	Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency."
443	Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?
443	In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other.
443	Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points.
443	I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points.
443	Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
443	Thanks for the update.
443	Bill
444	Real-Time is on board and is comfortable with this...any questions from settlements?
445	You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing.
445	Things are interesting.
445	Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then).
445	Not too much else is new.
445	My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle.
445	A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is.
445	Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph?
445	Is this true?
445	(And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not).
445	If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it.
445	As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down.
445	Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon).
445	Hope youre doing well.
445	Word.
446	Jon, Good to hear from you.
446	Glad to hear you are healing up, as for me, I am still working on the sprained knee.
446	Enough of this one game and out stuff.
446	Do you know when the outdoor season starts?
446	I am hoping to make some indoor games, but want to concentrate on outdoor.
446	Bill
447	Group, I can now be reached with email outside of work at wwilliamsiii@palm.net This should work even if my cell does not.
448	The BMW is of course a 1992!
448	Priced at only $9900!!!
448	How could you not buy it.
449	The Short Term West Hourly presentation is now in the O drive.
449	Thanks for the email...
450	Grace, Could you sign me up for the bus pass.
450	I am selling my car and no longer need the parking.
450	Thanks, Bill
451	Group, We will have a meeting on Thursday of next week at 4 PM (Pizza will be provided--finally) on JAN 24th.
451	I hope our transition to UBS from Enron will be complete by next Wednesday.
451	If so, we will be discussing what we hope to achieve this year and the look of the floor going forward.
451	If not, this meeting will likely be postponed.
451	Please call me with any questions.
451	Thanks, Bill
452	It's cold, its wet, its raining.
452	But at least in Portland we have F-15 fighter jets being scrambled over the city.
452	Gotta love it.
452	what's the word.
452	Drop me a line on the cellular--(503) 887-3449.
453	Thank you Les.

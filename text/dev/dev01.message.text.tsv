0	I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.
0	They are interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.
0	I am sending them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.
0	Again, this payment would come from the U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I suggest we get on it quickly.
0	I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.
0	I'm in Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.
0	Regards John Lavorato
1	If I remeber correctly, you were writing a time-table for the Ontario Peaker deal.
2	Kyle there in nothing on this message.
3	John, we did a deal with Peoples the co-manage some of there assets.
3	We are actually setting up a Chicago office with them and sending some people to it.
3	You should call Jean Mrha and find out the structure.
3	If might help us with a structure with Unical.
4	Cliff, lease the EOTT space.
5	Please stop sending me this report.
5	John.

6	Please give me a call when you start getting down the road on levels as I would like to talk about options and equity for some of my people.
6	Regards, John Lavorato
7	Angela - tasks 1.

7	Also get me a list of who our marketers are sending gifts to.
7	2.
7	Tell Milly I'm requesting 3000 for the Order of Good Cheer and that I will make a 1000 dollar donation personally that I will not as Enron to match.
8	Hello again everyone.
8	One last structure pre-christmas.
8	I'm am working on an option structure with TD bank that would see 20,000,000 CAD go out the door on Wednesday December 22nd or Thursday December 23rd.
8	There will be no special documentation necessary, only standard option confirmations.
8	The money will return equally over the 12 months of 2000.
8	TD is charging us a fee of 50K CAD for the idea but since it is different than the deals we have already done I'm OK with it.
8	What I need is the following.
8	1 - If there are any questions or concerns please call me early Monday morning.
8	2 - Jordon - Please call me and give me your OK.
8	3.
8	Juanita - Let me know if you can handle the payment in time.
8	4.
8	Joe - How's are Line of Credit coming - we're running out of time.
8	Thanks John Lavorato
9	As you know we were trying to do some funding deals prior to the end of the year.
9	We executed a total of $65 Million CAD with 4 different companies (TD, CIBC, Bank Paribas, and BMO).
9	Everyone who I cc'd this note to did a great job of helping us execute.
9	Regards John Lavorato
10	Cliff I want to add a seat between Chad and the window.
10	Can you check it out.
10	John.
11	David I'm going to extend and offer to someone who currently works at Koch.
11	I will extend the offer at the Director level but this person could easily pass as a Vice President.
11	I think I need to add some stock or options to the offer.
11	Can you please advise me on how I can accomplish this.
11	Thanks John Lavorato
12	Dawn, call me on Lambie and Brodeur.
13	Rob How good is that credit report from Bradford.
13	Can I use it or do we need Lon to update something monthly.
13	John
14	Rob, Paul is scheduled to come to Calgary early next week.
14	He should have a good idea of how Enerconnect went then.
14	I'm assuming your in, if you are not please call Paul and reschedule.
14	I'm in Houston for the rest of the week.
15	You can set it up.
15	I'm am overrulling Greg in the future.
15	John McKay can set up products.
16	Angela Please reschedule my lunch with Dan Fornier at Blakes for next week.
17	Jim This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information.
17	The only difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) followed by one each year after that.
17	Your report says that all Pickering units would come back in 2001.
17	Even in your report, however, they seem doubtful that this is realistic.
17	The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead for a long time if not for good.
17	Regards, John P.S.
17	I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we decide to build in Ontario.
18	Jeff, I don't know any of the Houston guys and I don't think the Calgary guys are important enough.
18	Lavo
19	Angela, make sure I buy Chris's gift on Monday.
19	Set up a Meeting, Milly, Kyle, Derek and Eric with Hemstock re.
19	regulatory.
20	We need the hourly data.
20	If they do not release it OPG has a significant advantage in a deregulating market.
20	Please push the issue.
20	John
21	Dan, we need to talk about cancelling some of our Telerate feeds.
21	John
22	I have a 1:10 meeting so I can't attend your marketing meeting.
22	I thought it might be a good idea to grab Lambie at noon and get him to attend your whole meeting.
22	He might have some insights into Alliance among other things.
23	I have a meeting at 1:15, I assume in my office, with some Houston folks.
23	The topic a potential purchase of Westcoast.
23	I would like both of you to attend.
24	John, I think they have to do something to improve the customize pages.
24	At a minimum, they need to build something so you don't have to re add day gas everyday.
25	Laura I just want to make sure we are paying ngx a twentieth not a tenth.
26	Lon puts a bunch of reports together for me, you don't have to e-mail me.
26	Thanks
27	Chris I just get Greg's reports on the intranet page.
27	You don't have to e-mail me.
28	Put a rush on the Fletcher Challenge 7 year deal.
28	We just signed a master with them.
28	In addition, I originally put last day in the book and it should be last 3 days.
29	Julie please call me.
30	Joe Thanks for taking the time to meet with the Canadian ministers.
30	If you would like me to be present when they come to Houston please let me know.

36	Dear xxxx I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good Cheer fundraising effort.
36	Our organization raised over $200,000 for the Enviros Program.
36	The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have experienced hardship.
36	Yours Truly John Lavorato.
37	Set up a quick 15 minute meeting with Lon and Laura Scott with respect to the income statement.
37	On Tuesday.
38	Angela.
38	Please move the reviews that I did to a directory that cannot be accessed by anyone but you.
39	Louise.
39	I would love to come but I'm on holiday.
39	I do have some thoughts and would love to share them with you.
40	Peter, I never said I would incur any costs.
41	Why are you congradulating me, I work for Delainey.
42	I've never heard of them.
42	Sorry.
43	John If you get a chance give me a call I would like to talk about this product.
44	So your overrulling me again.
45	let's talk in person

47	Action Items.
47	It looks like my calender is not Mountain time again.
47	Please fix.
47	Set up meeting on Monday.
47	30 Minutes - Andre 30 Minutes - Bill
48	Also Tuesday, Kyle and Eric 1/2 hour.
49	Have we rented our office space yet.
50	Milly it looks like your head of parking and you may need to lease our office space too.
51	Rob, that's good information, keep digging.
52	Dan I'm leaving for a couple of weeks.
52	I'll get you my computer when I come back.
52	John
53	Bill.
53	I've taken a look at your resume and pulled your internal reviews.
53	We have decided to go another route.
53	Sorry.
53	I'll be in Houston for the next three weeks if you want to talk to me.
53	John.
54	I don't know him that well, however, I don't think he is a superstar.
54	Rob Milnthorp in Calgary might have a better read.
55	Thanks
56	I'm a bachelor next week and would love to go to dinner.
56	Anywhere you want.
56	John
57	Dave Should we invite Presto and Beldon to this meeting.
57	I think so.
58	Wednesday at Rainbow lodge.
58	Can you book it and let me know.
59	Jane I finished my reseme and most of the form you gave me.
59	The only thing I'm currently missing is the copy of the passports for my wife and child.
59	Give me a call on Monday.
60	Tim I assume you know that you have to make a presentation at the offsite.
60	Can you send me a copy by Monday.
60	If not let me know.
60	Thanks John
61	Kevin I assume you know that you need a presentation for next week's offsite.
61	Can I see a copy ahead of time.
61	Thanks John Lavorato
62	Dave I'm thinking of hiring Kim Hillis.
62	I would like your opinion.
63	Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan under the following conditions.
63	1 - Volumes will not fall.
63	In fact they will increase.
63	2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then East Power will have no Emmisions Positions, 3 - Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.
63	4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not keeping.
63	Give me a call if there are any issues.
64	Is there anything in my current role that I won't have to champion.
65	The reason I called you today is to tell you that I noticed your EOL performance.
65	Not bad for a cunuck.
66	Shank It seems that Bradford still feels that we are commercially objecting to some credit mitigation.
66	Can you talk to him, Thanks Lavo Great job of minimizing the p/l hit late last week.
67	Howard Can you remove me from this distribution list - my life is a little complicated.
68	1.
68	I didn't know much about ag products but Ted Murphy is trying to include me in the loop.
68	2.
68	Chris Calger says that he has aggregated his CPI positions for the west.
68	Can check if Dave Duran has done this for the east and try to aggregate the position.
68	If you need help let me know.
68	John
69	Tim Can you get someone (perhaps a marketer) to give me a one pager on the WAPA deal.
70	Mark Send me an e-mail decribing how the quote process went.
70	If you need my help let me know.
71	Angela.
71	How is Thursday the 16th of May.
71	Call me John.
71	713-853-7991
72	Yes Thursday may 18th.
73	Chris, I'll figure this out, Please stop sending me this email.
74	I just sent an email to Chris telling him to stop sending me this email.
74	I guess he needs to send it.
75	GOOD
76	I think the list is OK.
76	Can you fedex me one of the deal entry books.
77	Ignore Shankman - I think that was a bit of joke.
78	aPPROVED
79	Jon Ignore expenses.
79	We just split the whole office in half to split the trading and marketing.
79	You are also not authorized to see some of those expenses.
79	So please ignore them.
80	Approved
81	I assume your working on this.
81	You owe me on the web page.
81	1.
81	Pricing - Lon's sheet.
81	2.
81	Power Sheets 3.
81	Peggy's volume and number of trades sheet.
82	Milly .
82	If you're going to sell the warrants yourself.
82	(It sounds like you should if your getting $2 in time value) let me know and I'll call off the equity group.
83	Call me on Beau.
83	A couple thoughts.
83	If they are so screwed why can't we get a couple million in fees.
83	Also, remember that the Canadian commericial group wears the debt not the credit group.
84	The genco was rolled into the East Trading.
84	Can we get rid of the Genco on the DPR.
85	Tim Please add bookrunners names beside the books on your P/L.
86	Mark Can you have one of your lawyers get me a copy of the Merryl Lynch deal we deal at the end of last year.
86	A short summary to supplement the contract would be great.
86	Thanks John
87	APPROVED
88	approved
89	Kevin I agree.
89	If we ultimately trade out of Toronto, the P/L responsibility will probably role into you.
89	It looks like we were trying to close Garret Tripp (Associate) to move to Toronto and start looking at this stuff.
89	If he is going, you should meet with him before he goes.
90	Can you please get a copy to my assistant Kim Hillis to put into my binder.
91	test
92	Please call Mike Moscoso and get the report on the Executive reports website.
92	I do not want to get an e-mail everyday.
92	Thanks
93	Rob I enjoyed meeting you last week.
93	Unfortunately I have decided to take another route.
93	Thanks
94	David I enjoyed meeting you last week.
94	Unfortunately I have decided to take another route.
95	Dave The weather group should show this P/L today
96	Thanks for the update and good job in handling this.
97	Ed Let me know when you will be ready to have a meeting with Dave and I to discuss your model and specific needs for expanding the middle market group.
98	You might want to file this.
98	Lavo
99	I need you guys to confirm that you are available June 3rd (Saturday) for the ENA super saturday.
99	P.S.
99	you need to say yes.
100	Call me when you get back.
101	Mark I like the route of Thor runnig Europe out of Oslo.
101	Why don't you make that happen and pass on the guy from Aquila for now.
101	Give me a call if you agree.
102	I hear you.
102	However, this big a difference doesn't make sense to me.
102	Are the scalers and the vol marked correctly.
103	yes
104	If Beth is our Systems person why is she in London.
105	Here are our picks for the incoming class.
105	Gas Analysts: Gabrial Chavez Nate Blackburn Phillip Berry (Maybe for Sally Beck or Beth Perlman) Sachin Gandhi Miguel Nasser James Wininger Associates Dustin Collins Li Sun Power Analysts: Elizabeth Johnston Possey Martinez Gary Justice Associates: Doug Seaworth Dustin Collins Eduardo Gil Pearce Hammond David Maskel Michael Kelly Please confirm how many of these we can lock up.
106	Mark I know I promised you a weekly trading update.
106	I got a little distracted this week.
106	I will get it done.
106	John
107	Call me
108	Looks good.
109	As discussed.
109	Gary give me a call before you call Gavin.
110	Dave I was told that I was changed over on June 1st.
110	Please make sure it is June 15th or I have tax problems.
111	Sure
112	Dave The PPA schedule was pushed back two weeks.
112	I would like to keep our meeting with Skilling because I heard he was going to Africa for 3 weeks.
113	Laurie As Discussed.
114	Now that we have so much time on our hands.......Please send me a list of products, terms and bid/offer spreads that we can negotiate for EOL.
115	Jane Sorry I was very busy last week.
115	The ammendment is no rush.
115	I will call you when I get a chance.
115	John
116	Dave I wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks to go to Portland.
116	PRC is going to eat up a lot of time in the next few weeks and it would be nice if Mike Swerzman was in town when we went.
116	However, whatever you want "I will follow"(U2).
117	Give me a call.
118	Jeff Can you set up a meetin with you and your desk heads and me for 1 hour this week to talk about EOL and product offerings.
119	All of a sudden Mark Frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about hedging re PPA's and if we can delay the auction 2 weeks.
119	The dream is still alive.
119	Let's see my boys come through.
120	The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit today.
120	This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.
120	This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a performance measurement standpoint.
120	Now that the curves are corrected I expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following ways: 1.
120	Understanding the fundamentals.
120	2.
120	Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
120	3.
120	Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
120	4.
120	Developing new traders.
120	Thanks John
121	Ron Thanks for your help with my house purchase.
121	Please forwad an bill to me at Enron (location eb3324).
122	Kim No more salary changes without my approval.
123	I'm just simply better than everyone else.
124	I think we should restrict Peter's memo's to 50 words or less.
124	Please advise.
124	Lavo.
125	Please excuse Kim Hillis and Kay Chapman from SAP timekeeping class and provide them with the necessary tools to learn this at their desks.
125	I understand that with this dismissal that they will be required to learn it on their own.
125	Kim Hillis is currently registered for the class on Thursday, June 29 and Kay Chapman had Beverly Stephens attend on her behalf.
125	Please provide them with a contact name in the event that they have any questions.
126	This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.
126	With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following: 1.
126	5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).
126	2.
126	Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).
126	3.
126	With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the "Cross Commodity Trading Group" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only employee).
126	This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading groups staying within their VAR limits).
126	However, I do see the need for a true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability trades accross the commodities that we trade.
126	This structure may help to start us down this path.
126	Please let me know what you think.
126	John
127	We're back baby.
128	Rick I wasn't double counting.
128	My 5 Million was the Cross commodity group.
128	I'm fine with your comments re.
128	Sherriff.
129	Rob Just to clear on our conversation.
129	I'm fine with the Sunoco transaction.
130	How is our internal trading of PJM demand going.
131	Dennis Thanks for your memo outlining your positions and strategies.
131	It was very helpful for me to understand your thought process which seems very sound.
131	I hope to spend more time with you guys in the future.
131	I am also working on the human resource issues you mentioned.
131	John Lavorato.
132	Dave It sounds like the urgency on the Wind Power decision wasn't a reality.
132	Kevin says that they are working on it.
132	If you need me to do anything let me know.
133	Looks good to me.
134	Please do not send me these charts.
135	Chris I know I have to sign this stuff.
135	I don't think I need the e-mails.
136	Your getting way to complicated.
136	This product may not trade much and until it does we can do most things manually.
137	Joe A couple of questions.
137	1.
137	Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.
137	2.
137	How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.
137	Talk to you soon.
137	John Lavorato
138	Kathryn Although we are a qualified bidder, we still have not made the decision to bid.
138	I would try to avoid discussing but if you need to give me a call.
139	Beth Please respond with a plan to solve these problems.
139	Thanks John
140	Let me know if she doesn't solve your problems.
141	Brad Can you get me a copy of the final PRC results for all employees in ENA.
142	Ed As well as Dave's suggestions, I would like to see value per transaction which I'm told you keep track of.
143	Dave Following up on our summit.
143	I wrote down that you would follow up on the synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by Scott Tholen.
143	I would be happy to coordinate this myself.
143	Please write back and let me know if this is okay.
144	I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom on the 30th floor.
144	I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders that you think would benefit from it.
145	Call me Lavo.
146	Dave It looks like we hit a home run.
147	I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for the next 10 business days.
147	I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.
147	The floor is very bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are eating up a lot of var.
147	Please advise.
148	This is the most bizarre resume I've seen in a long time.
149	Put all these dates on my calander.
150	Oxley and I will come up with a first stab at the option grants.
150	John
151	I guess we were wrong.
151	We were totally surprised by the a.g.a.
151	number.
151	We need to work on are ability to predict it.
151	Therefore, we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 40 Million limit.
151	I don't think there is any reason to change what we did today.
151	We will keep it in our pocket for 10 days unless you disagree.
151	John
152	Change the rating.
152	John Lavorato
153	I would love to see more detail.
154	Dave Can you get one of your people to handle this.
155	OK
156	Rick Can you include me on your distribution list re.
156	Nepool and the ICAP product.
156	Thanks
157	Jeff Why don't you take a stab at the disaster plan.
157	John
158	Ed How are you doing on these reports.
159	Figure out how to print this file on one or two pages that is readable.
160	Put this in my binder and tell him to start sending it to you.
161	Let's get this done quickly.
161	You should tell everyone what they need to do to accomplish this.
161	John.
162	Sorry Jim but I left you a voicemail saying that there was no material loss in trading.
163	Ed Set up a meeting with me and you to discuss this report.
164	Fifty dollars.
165	It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of power in Ontario.
165	1.
165	Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including building forward curves.
165	He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the Northeast U.S.).
165	Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for Ontario.
165	2.
165	My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.
165	This could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.
165	3.
165	John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have no power trading responsibilities.
165	4.
165	Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.
165	I expect us to use Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, however, Toms' main role will be N.Y. 5.
165	Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know the people and the technical resources available to him.
165	If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.
165	John
166	When we have made some inroads into SO2 analysis please set up another meeting with me.
167	No hurry.
167	You guys just peeked my interest last time and I would like to continue discussions.
167	John
168	I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list of agreed apon tasks.
168	1.
168	The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up.
168	--> Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.
168	(everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority) 2.
168	The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.
168	--> Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to address the problem.
168	We have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks.
168	Once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems.
168	3.
168	The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk.
168	TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs.
168	This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the traders to meet their needs.
168	--> Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads.
168	After this Beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.
168	4.
168	The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.
168	This is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.
168	Beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.
168	5.
168	Steve Natt is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements deals and volume management deals in the east.
168	6.
168	There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).
168	7.
168	Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with Houston.
168	--> John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in Portland.
168	--> Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering all his needs.
169	Where did you ever get the idea for this?
170	Dave I don't think I can follow up with 90 people.
170	Please advise me if I should be handling this or your group is hadling.
170	John
171	Jeff Please confirm that the assistants are going to the Houstonian to learn how to read the screens.
172	Dave Give me a call on the weekend if you get a chance.
172	I talked to Shankman and he talks about more groups going to Global than I thought.
172	Like to discuss.
172	Home 713-61-6096 Cell 713-417-3074
173	Tony Wow I don't think so.
173	I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors.
173	If you disagree please write me back.
173	I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation.
173	We went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.
173	It was absolutely awesome.
173	I had the time of my life.
173	We built the business with very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's bottom line.
173	These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.
173	So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businesses.
173	What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.
173	The opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.
173	These businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.
173	You can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities.
173	Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do.
173	It has much more complexity, and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down here!
173	....
173	we need you!
173	John's callout quote Enron's not a place where you can hide.
173	If you can't get it done you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.
174	I think we should play on Wabamun - assume we are.
175	I was right on the legal question Jeff asked.
175	Julia was wrong.
175	She is dropping a note to Skilling.
176	You didn't attach anything.
177	I've been assured about funding before.
177	I would like to know what Canadian vehicle they are going to use.
178	Dave What is the status: Have they seen them.
178	If they haven't I would to talk to you about it.
179	print this in color.
180	Greg here is our info: John,Dina and Michael Lavorato Phone Home 713-661-6096 Work 713-853-7991
181	What type of industrial.
181	ie Chemical, Fertilizer etc.
182	Ed This stuff looks good.
182	Why don't you combine all your stuff, maybe include the org chart also and see if we can get a 3 or 4 page report.
182	Send it to me and I'll run if by Dave.
183	John I asked about loss limits a couple months ago and Ted said that they no longer report these numbers to the board.
183	However, I think we should get rid of the whole concept.
183	VAR is the relevant concept.
183	Please advise.
184	I am not on side with a contract for Per.
184	Please give me a call.
185	i'm ok with this Brad McSherry|HOU|ECT wrote on 7/28/00 12:48 pm: John, Hunter Shively needs Doyle Baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline in the U.S. Doyle has done this for us in the past.
185	The terms of the agreement are as follows: Hunter anticipates that we will use Doyle for several months.
185	We can terminate our agreement at anytime.
185	Regards, Brad
186	Thanks Dave Hope everything is well in London.
187	You can call Sherrif.
187	If you need my help let me know.
188	Let's leave it for now.
188	John
189	Natural Gas Risk Management requests and increase to 45 Million from 40 Million to increase our gas fixed price position (long) until Tuesday morning (August 8th).
189	Thanks John
190	This looks good.
190	Don't worry I will definately call if I want something.
191	No storms in sight.
192	So do we have emmisions.
193	Brian Sorry I didn't get back quickly.
193	You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate perspective.
193	In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of what they would try to do in the next little while.
193	(ie how much one way exposure) This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market.
194	Sorry - A hurricane off Africa - I think you will have a good tail wind when you are leaving.
195	Please put the new hire thing at the doubletree on Monday on my schedule.
196	Thanks for the update and keep up the good work.
197	EES is trading them up.
197	Give me a call.
198	Fine.
199	I think Shankman wants me to go to this.
199	If this is true please put it on my schedule.
200	Kevin Is this the guy you are interviewing.
201	I haven't seen an e-mail.
202	Make sure this is on my schedule.
203	Hey Greg.
203	If you ever are in Houston again give me a call.
203	I want to talk to you about the order stuff in the second version of
204	I can't seem to print this.
204	Can you try.
205	Please give me a call this week I need some info.
206	David When you get back, hopefully in one peice.
206	Can you take care of my moving expenses and the gross up issue.
207	Thanks for the increased VAR.
207	We got it right this time.
208	Rick I would like to request an extension of the 45 million limit until Friday.
208	We like gas and we would like to maximize this move.
209	The PPA auction is going along well I think.
209	We are leading on Sundance B and have been for 3 rounds now.
209	Some weird things are occuring so it is too early to tell what will utimately happen.
209	The government has said that it will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.
209	We would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B. Currently we are bid $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD.
209	But again its too early to get our hopes up.
210	Does this mean that we have no VAR limit during this time.
211	We should be getting gas fax.
212	That's great.
212	Please don't let Len delay.
213	Dave Is there a round 2 of raptor and is Beau Canada going into it.
214	Just to be clear.
214	There will be no re-allocations of analysts and associates from ENA to Global Products.
215	What have you been smoking.
216	Make sure we don't lose these two to Jeff.
216	Call Celeste and tell them that we have place them in gas.
217	I talked to Whalley about it a little bit.
217	The one issue is that when we liquidate a bad position they get out first.
217	Think about it.
218	Mark We can make this even simpler.
218	All broker trades are confirmed the next day.
218	We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which is rare and all marketer deals.
218	If we do this we might consider keeping the tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.
218	Please advise.
219	I really think we can do this more systematically.
219	Give me a little time.
219	ie.
219	Trust me I'm the Godfather.
220	Dave I hate to make the management committee too big but how about Scott Tholen.
220	He is very high quality.
221	Can you please help Greg get this info.
221	I have to think that we have this info somewhere.
222	A couple questions.
222	Do I need to do anything next Wednesday or will money just hit my accout?
222	Will you pay the contractor and if so why is Len Wong involved?
222	John
223	Chris ask Dave he is still the king of your world in my mind.
224	Tim Given the tight schedule, lets try to find a half and hour for me to sit in front of all of the traders at once.
224	John
225	OK I think 3 days a year is fair.
226	Per I misplaced your emain on the funds.
226	Can you resend it please.
226	Thanks John
227	Beth I'm wondering if you are done are close on the systems plan.
227	I am getting on a plane early monday afternoon.
227	I would love something to review even if it is not complete.
227	Thanks John
228	Get Chris Abel on my schedule early Monday.
228	Also can you make sure that I have a computer set up for me in Portland and Calgary and that it gets me into my network.
228	I especially need to be able to get into the executive reports.
229	Dave We need to think about trying to get more VAR for the gas floor before all these other commodities go to the Board and scare the hell out of them.
229	I have several reasons for this so lets discuss.
230	10 Million - Pan Nat gas purchase from Duke - Contract allows for price determination.
230	10 Million - Tolls Risk associated with PGT transport that expires in 2023.
230	10 Million - Index Risk at Chicago as a result of the Peoples transaction I'll call you later today.
231	We won a PPA in Alberta.
231	We will know for sure on Thursday when the government declares the auctin a success or not.
231	It is highly like that it will be a success.
231	Please direct all detailed questions through Derek Davies in Canada
232	XXXX XXX
233	If this is OK with you its OK with me.
234	Paul The fellow in Andea Reed's group is all yours.
234	P.S.
234	How is our trade coming along.
235	Phillip Allen will put 50 Million in Schedule C reserve on August 23rd and Mike Grigsby and Kieth Holst will put 25 Million each on August 24th.
236	Change Holst and Grigsby to 35 Million and 35 Million.
237	Help
238	Dave Try to make sure that my assigned guys get significant roles.
238	Make sure they are interviewing on campus.
238	PS Herdon is a director not VP
239	That's fine by me.
240	Sorry Vince I have been out of town.
240	Please give me a call tomorrow.
241	I think I know what this E-mail is about.
242	Looks good to me.
242	John Lavorato
243	I would like to see the resumes.
244	Should the cap affect the marginal price of power in Ontario.
245	This e-mail is kind of funny.
246	Can I please see the resumes.
247	I keep hearing that Mcsherry is gone yet his xxxxxx name keeps coming up.
248	The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial managers.
249	I've told Presto to relax 17 times.
249	Just deal with me on this one.
250	I'm in Vegas this weekend, want to come.
250	P.S.
250	We should play soon I have averaged 94 in my last 5 rounds.
251	Good Job!
252	Wes Are we allocating people like research out to the various wholesale groups.
252	John
253	Fletch Make sure they also set up the fixed price vs. daily term swaps at Henry the Hub.
254	FYI - see below.
254	Belden is the King!
255	Looks great.
255	I think we should have a least 1 or 2 real time traders in Calgary.
256	Dave As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to get a sense of how many people we hire.
256	Might even need the number of hires and fires/resignations.
256	My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would be made.
257	Beth Get me that new list as soon a possible.
257	John
258	Why is Milnthorp doing a U.S. school and I thought I was doing MIT
259	Aslo where all my traders that I assigned.
260	Was Greg onside with this stuff?
260	Give me a call.
261	Rick I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems perspective.
261	I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.
261	We simple do not have one.
261	From there I will coordinate with traders and back office to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.
261	My new motto is "Systems will be fixed or people will die".
261	I will keep you informed.
261	John
262	Can I also get a copy of his resume.
263	I know you are screwing with me.
263	If you are not.
263	NO!
264	My opinion is that you need a budget.
265	Eric the contact names are listed at the bottom of this message.
265	Please call if you have questions.
266	Just say that I said that you did a great job.
267	no
268	Mike Can you live with the gas position reports.
268	John
269	No
270	hi nana its micael
271	No changes
272	No to Nelson and I'm ok with Scott but I would like to hear the figures.
273	Make sure the Benson's of the world who don't read their E-mails read this
274	Please give Mike Grigsby access to the basis position reports and the fixed price position reports for gas.
275	Let me sit on that because Scott's performance has not been as strong as Hunter and Fletch's.
276	Rick Buy I'm expecting more details from Bill re.
276	Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about this.
276	I will deal with my traders when I have the details.
276	On the Retail side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale trading group in retail which is clearly happening.
276	This wouldn't of happened it they were trading through us.
277	Call me about this.
278	Peter Deal with Joe Deffner directly.
278	I threatened his life if we don't pay them in time.
279	Rob Can you make sure that the Toronto Office is not blowing their minds on costs.
280	Fine Do it quickly.
281	Talk to Fletch about progress.
282	Get me info on this.
283	Good job on this.
284	Tim There is absolutely a spot for John.
284	Maybe he should give me a call or even come an see me.
284	Why don't you talk to him and also I would love your thoughts on what the best role for him would be.
285	Can you send the contract to me.
285	I guess this one went out before me.
286	Hoyt Did you get me response on Martin.
287	I don't but I need a golf shirt.
287	Just kidding.
288	Change it to 150 and 100 on Long term comp and ignore the bonus target and send it back to me.
288	I will forward it to Belden with a note.
288	Thanks
289	We got it covered.
289	It was my fault.
290	You should include VP's and also you should make it a little clearer that I don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision.
291	You missed logistics as a rotaion.
291	Also - Let's leave out where they graduate to.
291	This might be an issue with the AA program if we say that they are going to re-enter the program.
292	David I quess this whole Nelson Ferries contract thing started before me.
292	However, I can't imagine that we can retract on it.
292	Please advise.
293	Gas Var.
293	Gas Var.
293	Futures accounts.
294	Hoyt The Zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in Canada.
294	They might need to change his Contract to Canadian language but none of the terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon Canadian $ pay.
295	So I guess Dave doesn't want to send this out.
296	I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.
296	I think we need 100% of reviews done.
296	Do you agree.
297	Yes Call me.
298	Colleen I have no idea what my intent is.
298	I was trying to get more info so that I could evaulate things.
298	This may mean that I do nothing from a valuation perspective.
299	Get on my schedule.
300	Just wondering if I am going to take the same fate as Keith.
301	Kim Have you called Nigel and told him about the interviews.
302	Greg Thanks for taking the time to interview Nigel.
302	If you like him please sell him hard on
303	I having second thoughts about raising South American limits.
303	If its not too late and if I have a vote give me a call.
304	Did you get me the performance review forms.
305	Beth Can you get me an updated list of projects by October 9th.
306	Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.
306	This could help the communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas.
306	Please advise.
307	I know that you'll give me hell for this but I'm out of town for my Sister-in-Law's wedding that weekend.
307	John.
308	I guess I'll let this one slip through.
309	Charlene Just a comment.
309	I would love to facilitate a couple decision meetings when I'm in town.
310	I not sure I know who David Jallits is,
311	I hope you are talking to Phillip to get you system needs as part of this project.
312	I guess we will just go without a contract.
313	Bill Scott Neal talked to someone who said that we could do this.
313	Please call Scott.
314	I thought you hated getting involved.
314	Just kidding.
314	Congrats.
315	I'm sensing that you don't have much to do during the day.
315	I'm thinking about inviting Mark Waldren down at the same time.
315	Please advise.
316	This is what I mean aout miscommunication.
317	If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles" she would be in heaven.
317	We got a crazy cold spell last week but it should be gone when you come.
317	In case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be fine.
318	I'm okay with this.
319	I do not run EES trading.
319	I would contact Marty Sunde with respect to big costs that EES wants to spend.
319	Marty runs EES North America.
319	I agree with you however that they should't go crazy on spending.
320	Saturday 10 my course.
320	Sunday 8 Tour 18.
320	Friday - Working you.
321	Every golf course in Houston has a golf tournament next friday.
321	What do you think about mini-putt.
322	James might have a chance in putt-putt.
323	I would be happy to do a phone interview with this guy.
323	But I won't pay for him to fly down.
324	Call me on this I am a little confused.
325	This crazy.
325	Sooner or later they will win.
325	We need to do something radical to make them realize they are insane.
325	I don't know what that is.
326	So I'm working some magic for Friday.
326	I think we are going to play a private men only club for free (except for caddie fees).
326	I figure the downside is that we get pummled and left for dead.
326	I'll let you know.
327	Set me up on this.
328	Correction I never suggested this.
329	6437 Mercer St In West University.

335	John
336	No problem bensen
337	I think everybody is scared of us.
338	no interest
339	I think we are making great progress on the systems side.
339	I would like to set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects (I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.
339	When I say signed off I mean that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the plan for each project.
339	If you don't agree don't sign.
339	If certain projects (ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan will be complete.
339	I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives and timeframe.
339	Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.
339	John
340	Bob I talked to Kevin about these two guys and he feels they are critical to our business.
340	Broadband has taken 5 guys out of East Power and left us short.
340	Sorry

342	Sounds great.
343	What if they have there current postions but bigger getting them to their limits.
343	What would the agg var be.
344	Apparently not eh.
345	I'm sorry but I think its my only child syndrome.
346	Kevin I know its tough but your groups need to be involved in recruiting as much as possible to keep uplifting the talent in your group.
347	As requested.
348	Can we do it without the bonus target.
349	don't you love the ok method of communicating.

410	One thing that I would like changed is that I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last day.

447	Kevin Has Dave called you on this or do I need to do something.
448	Dave I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.
448	Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the futures trades.

477	NGX owes us a lot of money on Deceber 25th.
477	Please send me an email when we receive it.
477	Thanks John
478	Dave I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.
478	He has Per on the road working on it.
478	We probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless New Albany is enough.
479	Book this deal very conservatively.
479	ie.
479	set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income.
479	We will discuss in 2001.
479	John
480	That would be outsanding.
481	Dave I agree with all your points.
481	There had to be a first time.
481	I've been blowing Ted off because of the markets last week.

488	Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.
489	Can set up a conference call with me and Remi Cologne in Brazil this week.
489	Also, what happen to Manu.

492	Send me stuff on Wolfe's performance this year and where you would rank him.
492	I need this for tomorrow.
493	That would be outsanding.
494	Charlene My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).
494	If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.
494	I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.
494	Regards John
495	Wes Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas Association).
495	The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.
495	But I wonder if some of our other piplelines are members.

518	Can you fill in all info like the others for them including who they work for and get it back to me promtly.
518	Thanks
519	I thought I was very clear that we are not publishing anything internally about California gas prices.
520	The pain will stop soon.
521	Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power as the key to their real time group.
521	No request will be granted on an emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and checking with me.
521	Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.
522	Same a mid year I'm smarter than everyone else.
522	Just in Case * Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits taken) - probably not due to me.
522	* Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
522	* Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to turn it back.
522	* Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
522	* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in the future and every company is copying.
522	* Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in Houston.
522	* Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has bought into.
522	The future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile.
522	* Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of VAR.
522	Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group.
522	* Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the continuation of the increase in Gas.
522	* Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
522	* Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.
522	You will see this implemented in 2001.
522	* Experimented with the "Pay PRC" which I think was very successful.
522	I think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
522	* Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".
522	I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.
522	Regards John
523	The pain will stop soon.
524	I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.
524	Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 15 Million for gas for the next week.
524	The price levels are making it hard to eliminate risk.
524	I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to day will come from price movement, not increase in position.
524	Let me know John
525	Your the King.
526	Your the King.
527	You goated me into it, Here goes Minn -8 New Orleans -10 Denver -3 Jack -10 John I would like to sit with you a couple days this week if you'll let me.

667	Orlando On Ed Graham.
667	I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.
667	Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the issue after I talked to them.
667	They have decided to give him 6 months to perform or he will be let go.
667	His bonus for 2000 will be 0.
667	I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

670	Rebecca The South American's did't get me the data in time for you meeting with Skilling.
670	However, I'm still working on it.
670	Also, Kiskill and Orlando are coming next week so I'll get deep into the Electro stuff then.
670	Regards John P.S.
670	How are you making out on our paintings?
671	You and Chris already have your own room.
671	That was an old memo.

680	When I meet with Orlando and Joe on Thursday, see if Rebecca McDonald can be present.
681	Rob What's the deal on Deregulation in Ontario.
682	Ed I think Dave talked to you about this deal.
682	Can you get on my schedule tommorow to discuss the process for all these deals.
682	John
683	I wasn't aware of schedule B. What is it.
684	Kim Can you print this stuff for me.
685	My question is where do I find the graphs.
686	I booked a flight on Continental to San Francisco.
686	March 15th - Thursday - I arrive at 4:47.
686	March 18th - Sunday - I arrive back in Houston at 6:05 I think Tych is already in California.
686	If we can all get there at similar times we can get in our Cadillac and go.
687	Wes It's groundhog day again.
687	How many times are we going to have this discussion.
687	Give them the cost if they want the drift.

696	yes
697	no
698	Kim Print this guys resume and then hand it to me.
699	Send me a cleaner summary of your curve on 1/17/200.
699	All I want is a the curve by year - peak/off peak and total.
700	Dave I feel like I keep tasking you.
700	I've only got a couple of weeks.
700	Can you send Orlando and Joe a list of Outsourcing deals that we've done and the key contact person that they can talk to about the structures.
700	Thanks John
701	Steve looks ok.
701	Although I always thought I built Canada.
701	I guess not eh.
702	kIM PRINT THIS STUFF AND MAKE IT A HIGH PRIORITY FOR ME TODAY,.
703	I've only received one response to my inquiries into projects for Coleen.
703	John
704	You need to arrage this yourself.
704	The key is that the top companies on this list who don't trade with us neeed to.
705	President and Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX
706	I don't care as long as I see them
707	pRINT
708	Or did he leave me with the 2 Billion budget to get a 30 Million Budget.
709	Thanks Does Louise get to review me next year too.
710	Can we sell them Pastoria or do we have to sell them the power from us.
711	this one is from john - and should say from john
712	Hey Have you spoke to any of my folks yet?
712	If so what do you think.
712	John
713	Greg How about you being the Portland General risk manager.
713	My plate is full.
714	Thanks for the update.
714	Come and see me Tuesday, I ned some help on South America.
714	John
715	John I don't see Maggie's line on the P/L
716	Tim Give me a call on this I don't understand.
716	John
717	Dave I'm not sure Milly can escape this.
717	John
718	We absolutely should do this.
718	We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.
718	There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.
718	Brooklyn Union Peoples - Laura Luce My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.
718	Money will show up.
718	However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.
719	Your employees will be upset to leave Canterra.
720	Hunter Did you know that the Extrinsic value of the Northern Border Trasport from Ventura to Chicago has increase from 4.7 Million to 7 Million over two months.
721	I would love to play 4 or 5 games.
721	Just got back into town.
721	John Lavorato
722	Greg Why is EES's var being put in my 60 Million limit.
723	Christina and Joe Congrats.
723	I'm very happy for you guys.
723	We have been out of touch for way too long.
723	John
724	Stacey Assuming this P/L is going to stay at 0, get the line item off the DPR.
725	Chris Presto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.
725	Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.
725	It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.
725	If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.
726	Print them out I will do them by hand.
727	Tim I still don't see and origination line on the reports.
727	Give me a call because I really want this to happen.
727	John
728	Thanks Peter Hey did Mungo or Mongo are whatever the hell it is buy my house.
729	We need to talk for like 20 hours.
729	Let's schedule some time.
730	What happened with Arcor.
731	Where are you?
731	I hear your already living the new life.
731	Sick last week.
731	Vacation this week.
731	Buying land in Colorado next week?
732	You were supposed to pair me down at the top not the bottom
733	So I knew that you were going make some money last week off my positions but wow.
733	Just Kidding
734	Sounds great
735	Dave I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.
735	The 8th to the 11th.
735	Tych and Calger are O.K.
735	with this.
735	There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
735	Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.
735	John P.S.
735	Sorry for the confusion.
736	Your continuing to kill me.
736	Is that how you spell continuing.
737	Although I haven't heard from Dave I'm trying to change my flights to March 8 - 11.
738	Can't make it.
738	Thanks anyway.
739	Paul Fornataro
740	Congrats Please put a plan together for me.
740	John
741	Yes
742	Rob I'm very pleased about Petro.
742	Can send me the e-mail with the details.
742	I will forward it to the really big kids down here for you.
743	yes
744	Can the full Day end at 7.
745	I'll work up some paper.
745	John
746	Talk to Louise
747	I told you that Pope and Milly wouldn't last.
748	Please get someone to deal with this.
749	Derek Your in on Pebble if you want.
750	I guess I must stop calling you master Dorland.
751	The east power traders have agreed to post their two ways on EOL for EES.
751	Janet, you might want to help speed up the administrative process.
751	It should be minimal effort.
752	Do we need any help on the Ontario front from Lay or Skilling.
752	Given the size of the stakes, I could definately justify their time.
753	Your Pan Nat summary was not clear enough to pass on to my supervisors.
753	Can you simplify it a little more.
753	Thanks
754	So are you in or out.
755	oh god is there an agenda.
755	Would dinner Thursday work instead.
756	Your buddy Beau invited me.
756	How about prior to that or after that on Tuesday.
757	Chris Set up a time to go through Pastoria with me.
758	Rob is the deal actually signed.
759	Set me up
760	I look forward to the updated supply demand analysis.
760	John
761	Done
762	NO but we need to solve this quick because a lot divided by three is more than a lot divided by four.
762	Another math tip from Lavo
763	Rob I'm going to get on Ken Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).
763	I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.
763	I'm concerned that hoards of people from Houston will show up and that it will be a cluster.
763	Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.
763	Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my Ken meeting.
763	Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized.
764	I working on it.
764	Scott Tholan reports to Greg Whalley.
764	I got the rest covered.
765	It's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var.
765	I have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field.
765	On our other issue, I working on getting something in front of you this week.
766	Bob, Please increase Kim Hillis' (my assistant) email file.
766	Kim often receives mail files on my behalf and needs the additional space to receive this mail.
767	Chris On the California deal.
767	Can we possibly get the right to kill the deal 6 months from now if they do not get some credit support.
767	We may not exercise the option anyway, however, it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free.
767	John.
768	Maybe you can have a diesal position.
768	If you can justify it to me and Rick Buy.
768	Talk to Shankman and see who in his organization runs that product.
769	I need you to leave me alone for a week.
770	Kim can you set up a phone interview with this guy next week.
771	No
772	I would like to talk about Dana.
772	Can you a Oxley recommend a contract to me.
772	Do not mention it to Dana.
773	There seems some confusion about the "AMPS" project.
773	This project continues to be an Enron North America project.
774	Where's my index.
775	Here goes Tych owes Wes 180 Ox owes Wes 40 Ox owes me 40 Dave owes me 70
776	This could be very dangerous.
776	OPG controls all the megawatts.
776	They could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.
776	If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months.
777	IGNORE FRANK.
777	I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TRADING POWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT MIGHT CHANGE SOON.
778	Put this in my central desk binder - gas.
779	This goes in the second coverless binder we created.
779	Get you not me on the distribution list.
780	Dave That sounds reasonable, however, I am looking at taking a different tract (ie. going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company).
780	This has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 2 weeks.
780	I will keep you posted.
780	PS That's the longest email I've ever written.
781	Kim Same deal as the legal memo stuff.
782	Take the gloves off.
783	Tim - It doesn't need to hit the dpr.
783	- Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's - If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem - Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat.
783	He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.
783	We're not trying to build Stat Oil here.
783	- If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.
783	Having said all that.
783	If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.
783	Call me.
784	Print and put in my inbox.
785	Is the paper done?
785	Still don't know what project Maple Leaf is.
786	john lavorato 6437 Mercer St. Houston TX Work 713-853-7991
787	Are we missing one.
788	Wayne If Michael Moutlon wishes to pay for this I'm O.K.
788	with it.
788	The memory business was never sponsored by North America.
788	Please get Michael to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay.
788	Thanks John
789	You don't need Presto.
789	It's administrative and has nothing to do with him.
790	I thought Eric was gas.
790	Depending on the cost profile we would probably still do this.
790	The question is do you buy options on sites, buy sites, and whether or not you pursue permits.
791	Sounds fine.
791	I haven't seen the latest agenda for Ken.
792	Louise I'm in Toronto with Lay on April 4th.
792	You should attempt to go to this.
792	John
793	Dave Can you follow up on this.
794	They forgot one.
795	ya
796	I agree - having some trouble because dave wants ees on your floor giving you no room to grow and I'm fighting that.
796	Anyhow - soon.
797	We don't need the currency or mmbtu/gj conversion language if Gas Daily agrees to what we want.
798	Dave When is the Gas Daily meeting.
798	I would like to attend.
798	I think I could help with the pitch.
799	Pete You might want to spend more time on Cuiaba.
799	I assume your aware that we are putting all aspects of the project into the accrual bucket including the stuff we once marked.
799	John
800	Print and put in my inbox
801	Print and put in my inbox
802	I'm in Brazil returning that night.
802	You can decide if you can reschedule or not.
802	John sent me the index.
802	Get him to send it to you.
803	Tammy Check into this.
803	If these were index trades they should be in our physical volumes not financial.
804	I mentioned it to Jeff breifly and I will re-mention it on the plane.
804	I think it is higher than 67 Million.
804	Kent Castleman knows the details.
804	John
805	Wes I'm away Monday and Tuesday in Brazil.
805	I thought I would give you things that I'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week.
805	1.
805	Your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 3 formats.
805	2.
805	On South America - Lot's of stuff but we'll talk when I get back.
805	Most importantly that I get an income statement that looks like North America.
805	- They did a trade with me that's up 8 Million for them.
805	This is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in N.A. The positive p/l was showing up in South America.
805	(We should make sure this trade does not get cash settled. The last thing I want is Cash going to S.A. on an internal trade. 3. Cross Commodity Book. - I have 1.9 Million of losses that were last year that they found in January. Put this in the TBG line and change the line name to Other . In the Footnotes we will explain all others. I'm sure there is a million things to come. 4. We also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me. 5. I've set up a meeting with you,me,Deffner and Louise on this 15% capital charge. We should come up with another methodology. That's all I can think of now. John
806	Has an agreement been reached between South America and North America on the Turbine.
806	Or is North America waiting for final approval of its power plant
807	What happened to Dona Francisca.
808	Mark You still own me you expected values for Pan Nat.
809	I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.
809	We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.
809	I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.
809	I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.
810	Milly This looks good especially if you get Harris.
810	What do they want me to be part of if anything.
810	I was assuming the Breakfast and the Lunch and hopefully the meeting with Harris.
810	Can you let me know so I can set up my schedule.
810	I would like to go see the Toronto office and also get some personal time in. Thanks John
811	Can you get me Julie's presentation.
811	I'm in Toronto on April 4th and may be able to come to N.Y. However I would want to know how many meeting you would want me to attend and the message you would want sent if any.
811	Unfortunately, my time is unbelievably tight.
811	I can't assure you yet that I can make it, but I would like to try.
812	Wes With respect to the PPA reserve.
812	We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.
812	We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.
812	Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.
812	However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.
812	We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.
813	Dave I thought we were hiring 1 person from EBS not two.
813	William Abler was ranked as a strong director.
813	I will agree, but I hope the quality is as high as you think.
813	We are going to get tones of resumes from EES and EBS, if your going to blow all you bullets upfront, make sure your getting great people.
814	Some guy at Duke told Mark Frevert today that on March 15th, Duke won a court ruling saying that they expanded the scope of the PanNat Arbitration.
814	True?
815	Mark We get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for PAN NAT.
815	Although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to Duke that they had no support for their position.
815	We would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers.
815	As we understand it arbitration starts July 1.
815	I'll talk to you more next week.
815	If you want an update prior call Richard Sanders.
815	John
816	As you would say.
816	There is good news and bad news.
816	The good - we got the dining room chair.
816	The bad - it was an end/arm chair not a side chair.
816	Specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms.
816	Good Luck John
817	test
818	EES and EBS are going to cut commercial staff as well as non-commercial.
819	Possibly April 5th Morning and Lunch, leaving sometime late afternoon to Houston.
820	Kim Print Julie's report for me.
821	Kim Besides my chair - here is a list of stuff to chase down while I'm away.
821	Principal investing Miller owes me a hi - lo valuation of his investments and a meeting alone with him.
821	I thought that was going to be last week.
821	Set up the meeting for this week.
821	Set up the Oxley - Louise meeting is Friday moring, I need some time to prepare for it.
821	Car Phone House Computer
822	I met with Shea in Houston.
822	Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.
822	He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.
822	Until recently I was happy with Lambie.
822	Call me.
822	We should think about it.
823	I would love to meet with you and I'm sure Louise would too.
823	I would also like to take you to dinner.
823	Let me know.
824	Is this because you are focusing all you attention on the Diversity Committee.?
825	Boy does this sound like something that would get fucked up.
825	Start with Paul Devries in Toronto and let me know what happens.
825	I didn't even know it was closing.
826	I was in S.A. until this morning.
826	I need sleep tonight.
826	We'll get it done.
827	I didn't get it and I still don't have it.
827	Just in case.
827	Lavorato@enron.com
828	Greg I'm getting a million e-mails from my people about these committees.
828	The next time someone puts a bunch of my people on committees, do you think someone could seek my input.
829	I was all set to send the press release to my mother and then I saw Louise's name.
830	WE seem to be missing Matt Motley in Portland
831	Is the Geresul contract done.
832	Has Ken Lay received a breifing binder yet?
832	Can I get a copy soon?
832	Thanks John
833	I keep hearing that we will resolve the tape issue soon.
833	Can we go over to the broker's office and listen to the tapes.
834	I'm I still banned from Hockey pools because I always win?
835	Thank God math pays more than grammer.
836	If I can't participate, can I bet on how many times everyone yells at Squid about taking too much time.
837	wow!
838	Keeping to my reputation, I'll keep this brief.
838	You guys owe me 275 each for Pebble.
838	Since I owe Chris 310 for a flight and keeping it as easy as possible for me.
838	Dirk pays Chris 45 Dirk pays me 230 Thanks
839	After a great deal of work the Canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with PetroCanada for another 5 years.
839	This was a great accomplishment for Enron Canada.
839	The Logistics, Accounting and Commercial execution over the last 3 and 1/2 years played a key role in extending this deal.
839	John
840	ya
841	We're in.
842	Were you a guest speaker?
843	blow me
844	Thanks for your help on this.
845	Hi John I think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units.
845	I think this is a waste of time.
845	We can include them in our business unit PRC's for Managers and Directors.
845	Any comments.
846	When are you and Laura coming down for a Golf game.
847	I'm in if I can pick Mario more than once.
848	Neil I got the resumes.
848	Come and see me.
849	Rob You simply can't negotiate on a choice market.
849	Are your owed past fees for management?
849	Let me know.
849	I don't run industrial markets and Greg would have to settle this dispute.
849	You would lose.
850	Who sais choice markets don't work.

861	Let me know if you disagree.
861	John
862	let's stay away
863	I couldn't meet with Joon due to PG&E on Friday.

876	Let's hook up in the next couple of weeks.
877	There seems to be a lot of folks at Enron involved with Sithe.
877	Currently Donahue and Detmering are the most senior people negotiating with them.

887	How about Mezaluna?
888	How many groups does Don have?
889	Unfortunately I can't make it.
890	wow
891	Can you look into this.
891	Don't waste too much time on it.
892	I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to interview Greg Shea.
892	I've known Greg for a long time and tried to hire him on several occasions.
892	Jon McKay has indicated that he would like to return to Houston for personal reasons later this year and we will need more senior talent in Calgary.

896	Witt implies to me he was done.
897	Greg Our Copel shares are falling in value.
897	We have never marked this investment even though it is public.
897	We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.
897	We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.

905	John
906	Tim You will get stopped out.
906	I talked to David Port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var.
906	However, until its fixed I have no choice but to use the reported numbers.
907	WES Can you call Milly and explain the facts of life to him
908	I don't want to talk to you.
908	Talk to Tim and Kevin.
909	Dave This is the format I want.
909	Can you have someone check the data and then print and deliver a color copy to me and Louise today.
909	And then update it every week over the next month as we try to finish this process.
910	Great!!!!
911	Stan Please read the attachments.
911	He has met with several people on the Executive Committee.
911	I just want to proceed before the meeting next monday.
911	Let me know.
911	John
912	Are you guys okay with this.
913	Along with all the questions that Louise asked, can I please see the resume.
914	Ask Milnthorp
915	I remember that we talked about him.
915	Can you please give me a call.

917	Linda Is was nice meeting you at the pro-am.
917	I hope you had as much fun as I did.

917	John Lavorato Thanks
918	First, congrats on buying a great house for free.
918	Need to put up a fence in the back because Bob is a pain and somehow convinced me to take done the fence.

918	john

924	Mark Make sure you are allocating these expenses to EES.
925	Cliff Good luck and more importantly, have fun!!!
925	Thanks again for bringing me down here to compete with the big dogs.
925	I think I've survived so far.
926	Dave I changed it slightly so I could sleep at night.
926	The top line is just a little joke from me to you.
926	Let me know.
927	no
928	We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.
928	Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.
928	Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.
928	I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).
928	If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.
928	Please respond prompty, John
929	Hello everyone.
929	In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.
929	Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).
929	I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.
929	I would like suggestions as to: 1) Where to go.
929	2) What should be the focus of the business meetings.
929	3) Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?
929	I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.
929	4) And any other ideas you have.
929	In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.
929	The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.
929	Please add this to your schedule.
929	I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.
929	Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.
929	Regards John
930	We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.
930	I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.
930	If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.
930	If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.
931	Seemed to want to trade equities.
932	Yes - Sorry
933	ok I've added them, forward the email's for me.
934	It would be helpful to our corporation if you would try to hire some of your staff from places other than Enron North America.
934	Thanks John
935	do you have an extra raquet
936	PLEASE PRINT THIS FOR ME.
936	I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO PRINT.
937	Phil Are we allowed to attend?
937	Can we send an Analyst?
938	I asked everyone for their A/A needs and received very little feedback.
938	Please respond promptly.
938	Thanks John
939	Please let Kim Hillis (my assistant) know about all the EES meetings planned for this week.
939	I'm going to try to attend.
940	Can I get an updated contract status report.
941	if he is the wellhead book
942	yes
943	Hi We are getting in several anylysts and associates (new hires) in the next few months.
943	We also have interns coming for summer only.
943	Do you need any.
943	Can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits.
943	John
944	I just need numbers.
945	Dave I booked a time for 7:30 on Sunday.
945	I can't play because its mothers day and I would get killed.
945	Use the time if you want or get Kay to cancel it.
946	YOUR CALL, JUST DO IT QUICK
947	Did you blow up my South America Deal Yet.
948	I'm prettry pumped about losing 13
949	Wes is going to tell me in the morning if he is coming with us to Steel Town.
949	go mario
950	Joe I once again asked about the committee.
950	I think Skilling, Delainey and Kean set up the committee and I'm told that there are going to be no changes.
950	You and I will need to go over your Vice Presidents prior to the meeting.
950	John
951	Can I get that PRC list from you when its on one page.
952	I told Miller that you and him should sit down and discuss the PPA.
953	yes
954	Take a two week vacation!!!
955	Let's make sure that Presto, Tycholiz, Whitt, Lucci, Kerigan, and Proffit are either signed or will never sign by the end of this month.
956	NO
957	I thought Rogers signed a long time ago but check with Oxley
958	YES
959	YOU CAN PICK
960	This is pretty sensitive stuff.
960	We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.
960	I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.
961	Can we get more critical mass.
961	Our Portland guys, ie Wolfe, might have some Montana counterparts.
962	I would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.
962	I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.
962	I basically told everyone to drop it when Mike proposed his numbers.
962	Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.
962	We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.
962	For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.
962	Let me know if you want to discuss it further.
963	What's up Ross.
963	To your questions: Yes to Houston Yes to Enron Almost to running the company although I'm thinking about demoting myself (I miss trading).
963	Married, one child, 2 1/2 Michael.
963	Give me a call if your in Houston and we'll have a few drinks.
963	John Lavorato President and Chief Executive Officer Enron Americas
964	From the Gas and Power side, we wouldn't need any traders in Montreal, but perhaps some marketers.
964	Paul Devries in Toronto runs our Eastern Canada operation if you would like to talk to him.
964	John
965	I'm confused by this one.
965	Who in ENA is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing.
966	20 Million !!!!!!
966	Is this back money or forward money.
966	Why did the volumes change so much.
967	We should have room on 6.
967	Check and see if Arnold has redone the floor plan.
967	You need to keep this away from Fred's group.
967	I would suggest locating near Gas Structuring.
967	Ed McMichael, the head of gas structuring can be a big help.
968	Accounting lists the high prob.
968	q2 deals for my budget meeting with Whalley.
968	Currently you have one deal on it that is DWR and it says 10 Million.
968	Could you please make sure the commication with Accounting is taking place.
968	John
969	Brett Have you heard of a deal called Camargo Correa.
969	Its listed as a high probability deal for q2 with 8.4 Million of Origination.
970	I'm talking to Dave about Hughes reporting to Sally.
970	They don't need to even check the bill.
970	They can have a customer service group and if the customer calls the customer service group can deal with our guys.
970	JOHN
971	FYI
972	I ask again.
972	Who in ENA did the deal.
973	Hello Everyone.
973	AEP has been very cooperative with us when we have posted numbers in error on EOL.
973	Please extend them back the favor if an issue comes up on their side.
973	Also please e-mail me if an issue comes up.
973	Thanks John
974	wow
975	Where are we at with the contracts for this month.
976	It would be helpful to have the cases below 50.
977	I'm not sure that we have enough candidates to bother.
978	I don't want mark to market I want accrual.
979	Thanks Aint Technology great.
980	I understand you owe Jean 1.25 Million this week.
980	Please make sure it's paid.
981	Just use mids on the day they were pulled.
982	Management sucks.
983	I'm definately not going to support you on this.
983	Just Kidding
984	Call me about the dynegy thing I have an idea.
985	Have we sold any Copel shares yet.
985	Have you told Hickerson to sell.
986	Rob and John We sorted out NGX today.
986	Our Data will be ready by the end of June for them to start including it on July 1st.
986	The 7 day settlement issue is another whole issue.
987	On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.
987	The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.
987	We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.
987	I had a couple of observations from last time.
987	1.
987	I think we were too hard on external candidates.
987	There are 5 or 6 external candidates.
987	Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.
987	Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.
987	Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.
987	2.
987	Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.
987	That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day.
987	I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.
987	Regards John
988	This week or next week.
989	This is bizzare.
989	Global Markets promised Jean this money and won't seem to write her a check.
989	It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.
989	John
990	I don't need to see him.
991	Rick I would like to make the temperary VAR permanent.
991	I would give most to gas and some to power.
991	I feel like its the best place in the company for it.
991	Please let me know.
991	John
992	There should be an appetite for increasing overall risk at Enron.
993	Delainey and I started initial discussions reguarding EES and the customers and products they plan to market.
993	These were initial discussions.
993	Dave is writing something up to send to me.
993	Before I agree on anything I will talk to all of you.
993	Some of the meeting that are happening may be a little premature.
993	John
994	I'm getting really really tired.
994	If the company's intent is for me to just run a trading operation let me know.
995	Kevin I'm meeting with Dick and Mike at 9 and 10 this morning.
995	I'll let yoy know if there are any problems.
996	1.
996	How much is Reuters paying us.
996	2.
996	What is you decorators number.
997	good
998	This person hasn't found a violation in a year.
998	I find that hard to believe.
999	I wish I could help.
1000	My thoughts are the same.
1000	You should stay in Canterra.
1000	We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.
1000	Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.
1001	Just talked to Shapiro.
1001	He wants Lay, Alex and me in the meeting.
1001	I of course was fighting Alex.
1001	I'm okay with Lay meeting other people while he is in town.
1001	Shapiro said he would get Alex working on the talking points.
1001	You and Devries should spend time on them before they come to me.
1002	not that I know of.
1003	Great!!!
1004	Is this in Nevis?
1005	Call me on this.
1006	Fun Fun Fun
1007	This 250K came from about 3 MW.
1008	i'm not sure
1009	If we didn't sell any ELP shares over 7 yet I'm taking over the execution.
1010	Done 7:20 at the Houstonian.
1010	See you there.
1011	I thought you would find this funny.
1012	Hi my name is Joooohhhn Lavorato from Tarona Canada.
1012	How the hell are you guys?
1012	Where the hell are you guys?
1012	Call me, I'm still an Enron hack.
1013	Can you guys please have all your curves set by 3:00 Calgary Time.
1013	As well as Kathy, a lot of Houston bookrunners are having late hours due to the lack of discipline in setting Canadian curves.
1013	Thanks John
1014	Greg do you agree with the notes below.
1014	John
1015	I think we are going to pass.
1016	No one needed for the PRC.
1016	Jaime Williams and Steve Irwin are co leads.
1017	Wait until Louise gets back.
1017	These should not be big.
1017	ie 50 and 125 at most.
1017	I'm not even sure that Irvine is the right guy in the end.
1018	If the gas isn't going into Jackson, where is it going.
1019	I guess they have signed quite a few deals.
1020	rock on
1021	just so you know.
1021	I've talked to zufferli, cowan and lambie this week.
1021	I'm working on it.
1022	Joe First of all - blow me.
1022	Second, my wife is expecting in early November so I might be able to slip away in September.
1022	I would vote for anything that would require one flight from Houston.
1022	I'm sure Rich would agree.
1022	ie.
1022	Timmins would be tough.
1022	I would love to join you all and get mocked for an entire weekend.
1022	or Lavo as the hacks down here call me.
1023	I put it on my schedule for July 10th.
1023	Please call me the week before.
1023	My schedule is a little crazy.
1024	Go ahead and schedule the meeting.
1025	Just go ahead and talk to Dave about the other industries.
1026	They are working quite a complex tax structure in Canada.
1026	I'm not sure what role I should play.
1026	Should I just assume that they know what they are doing and let them do whatever they want sort of like the finance guys do with our balance sheet or should I get involved.
1026	My first take was that this was way too good to be true.
1026	John
1027	Jeff Sorry it took so long to respond.
1027	I talked to our EOL guys and they keep this stuff very close to their vest.
1027	People are talking to us about buying the code but this would cost tens of millions of dollars.
1027	So I don't think I can help.
1027	Sorry John
1028	You should use 30 c1 with that many people.
1029	give me a couple of days please
1030	Stan I haven't heard from the fellow from El Paso
1031	Yes I want to move next weekend.
1031	If we can start at 2 PM on Friday it would be fine.
1032	big commission
1033	Kevin Can you settle this guy down.
1033	As well as always whining about his fake trading account, he wants to accellerate out of real time early.
1033	Tell him to do his time and learn.
1033	Also he wanted to go to Harry's group next which is a mistake.
1033	He needs to learn the business not the derivatives.
1033	John
1034	chapter 1 - public relations.
1034	Go down the employee list from highest to lowest paid.
1034	When you get to someone that makes under 60 K per year make them Enron Americas Public Relations person.
1035	Please keep this to yourself.
1035	Sally Beck will meet with you guys this week about having logistic leads for your respective regions reporting to you'all.
1035	Let me know how it goes.
1036	Greg This list is virtually final.
1036	Any changes will not be material.
1036	I think you should add Louise in the 2-3 level.
1036	I'll call you later.
1037	I guess our confirm group shouldn't be worried
1038	Thanks for your help Dorie.
1039	I met with El Paso.
1039	The just got a $1 Billion financing in Brazil and I think they really want to buy Electrobolt.
1039	Working It.
1040	Does this sound right bill.
1041	tych - we are not below bbb
1042	Can your respond to me so I can respond to Clayton
1043	I just noticed this.
1043	I would support Gorte.

1074	We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).
1074	If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.
1074	2.
1074	In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.

0	Attached for your reference and commentary is a first draft of a contact list to assist in communication of our key efforts globally.
0	Please make any additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and return to my office for update and distribution.
0	The goal is not to list out everyone working on a project or business but to include a couple of players if someone needs information about how this could apply to their business.
0	Thanks, mike
1	George, The URL didn't work, please leave me a voicemail on their next stepts.
1	Have a good week.
1	mike
2	FYI, mike
3	Jeff, FYI.
3	I will co-ordinate an executive dinner.
3	He is a great guy and a real player.
3	Sanjiv has asked Ken to be on the board and he is considering.
3	I'll give more details later.
3	Mike
4	Suzanne, I glanced at the presentation.
4	It looks good.
4	Two comments: 1.
4	Could we use our older machines for home use?
4	They are still very good they just aren't the newest technology.
4	All are fast, CD ready with plenty of memory.
4	It could knock the cost down significantly.
4	2.
4	I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.
4	That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.
4	I recommend that you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.
4	Good luck.
4	Your teams hard work really shows here.

5	Richard, Hello from South America.
5	I am forwarding this email from John regarding the J-Block problems.
5	Have you been involved in this?
5	What are your thoughts?
5	If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please follow-up.
5	This is confidential but i thought you could help.
5	When he mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.
5	Amazing how the memory fades on some of the details in just a few years.
5	Mike
6	John, Hello from South America.
6	I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call.
6	He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva.
6	This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance.
6	I don't know how much it will help however.
6	Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone through it with them.
6	I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project.
6	When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.
6	I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.
6	Good luck, Mike
7	Julie, thanks for the update.
7	a couple of items.
7	1.
7	take out IT compliance and we will make it 1 dot point under PB's area of technology update 2.
7	metals - call it MG(plc) 3.
7	take out page 16 (initiatives under consideration) 4.
7	Change org chart; Jay - add investments and New Mkt.
7	identification; take S horn off 5.
7	on agenda page add sub dots for project updates and accomplishments under technology update 6.
7	Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well, give him a call for a draft.
7	It will go in the vision section put it toward the back of the vision section On further emails, only send me change or new pages.
7	It takes forever to download this (EOL) when I replicate.
7	Thanks,
8	Hello from South America.
8	By way of this email I will ask Cathy Phillips to send you a bio and picturas requested.
8	I will present the Net Works story and EOL in a presentationif they would like.
8	The EOL presentation and statistics are very cool.
8	Idon't have a lot to send them in advance but you can say that ENW is changing everything on our new approach to business and it will be huge.
8	Let me knoif there is something else that I can do.
8	Thanks, mike Enron Technology
9	John, Below is a response from Richard Harper.
9	A couple of interesting thoughts.
9	Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or testing concepts.
9	He is brilliant on this.
9	Just a thought.
9	Mike
10	Thanks for the quick response.
10	I sent it on to John.
10	Don't be surprised if he calls you; you are the master of this deal.
10	Mike
11	Steve, Thanks for the update.
11	I was stunned by your email and didn't know about your father.
11	I am very sorry for your loss.
11	My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.
11	Mike
12	Please fill in my meetings on my calendar as we normally do.
12	thanks,
13	PB, what do you think?
14	Bob, Hello from S America.
14	I would recommend 2 people.
14	Both are obvious but Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.
14	If they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.
14	Mike
15	Blake, Thanks for the email.
15	I will work on it.
15	I am out for the next several weeks, S America (today), Korea and Japan in the next 2 weeks.
15	If I don't follow-up after that, please email me again.
15	Thanks for the kind words.
15	mike Enron North America Corp.
16	Cp, please set up 15 minutes some time in July.
16	thanks, mike
17	Mary Nell and Peter, I certainly agree.
17	I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the right action before we do anything else.
17	John will hear the result of that conversation as soon as it happens.
17	Thanks and good luck.
17	Mike Mike
18	John, FYI, Mike
19	Philippe, I did talk to Skilling about this.
19	I must have forgotten to call you.
19	Jeff really does want it around, you were correct.
19	Is there a compromise solution here?
19	Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?
19	Think about items like that and lets discuss.
19	At this point in time, lets not assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all of it.
19	One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.
19	How much will it really save?
19	Those numbers a long with all the other points might bring clarity to what we should do.
19	Thanks, Mike Enron North America Corp.
20	Richard, Right now I'm scheduled to be out of the country.
20	When you come in, call Cathy (3-6898) and see if it will work.
20	Mike
21	Julie, thanks for the update.
21	Please add one more change i noticed.
21	Please add Managing Director & CTO to Philippe on the org.
21	chart.
21	Also send next draft and final to Jeff McMahon and Greg Whalley.
21	thanks,
22	Joe, Thanks for the email.
22	I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help.
22	If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.
22	Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday.
22	Is Anthony in japan during the trip?
22	Remember, I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities.
22	A couple of other questions about the trip.
22	Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?
22	Also, what is the appropriate dress code.
22	I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures.
22	Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?
22	Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.
22	I normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.
22	If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.
22	One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel.
22	I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps.
22	Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip.
22	I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture.
22	Thanks, Mike
23	Julie, looks great.
23	Please make sure the video is also in there.
23	I'm doing better but very week.
23	Ready to try food.
23	If I am at all better i will get on the plane tomorow.
23	Yolanda is going to messanger a bunch of stuff to my house later, just make sure she gets the CD.
23	Thanks,
24	I'll let you know later.
24	thanks,
25	Joe, Thanks for the response.
25	As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.
25	I am writing this from my bed and I am improving.
25	I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will be fine).
25	I'm definitely in recovery mode.
25	I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.
25	I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, especially if i am still a little under the weather.
25	I still don't want to have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process.
25	Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance.
25	Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.
25	Mike McConnell
26	Allan, Thanks, I'll add them to the list.
26	I would appreciate a self appraisal feedback form on yourself with your list of accomplishments to date.
26	(I know it is hard to put together when you've been here for as long as you have).
26	mike Enron North America Corp.
27	Thanks for your help.
27	We got in and its working fine.
27	mike
28	Now you know we don't have the room!
28	mike
29	Philippe, I don't really understand this guys question.
29	I need to respond to him with something because I know his dad very well via JDF.
29	Ross Cooley was Rod Canions #2 guy at compaq for years.
29	Can you send me to the right person?
29	Thanks, Mike
30	Wade, I had a good discussion with Hemant.
30	I am in full support of his position as a VP at Enron.
30	Mike
31	Mike, I am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the day.
31	Cathy has attempted to coordinate and has set him up to talk with a couple of other senior people in New Works and technology.
31	She will know if my schedules changes and I become available.
31	Sorry it couldn't work out.
31	mike
32	John, Howdy from Houston.
32	I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is involved with several ventures including a German VC called eStreet.
32	Are you aware of these guys?
32	They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties in Europe especially Spain.
32	I will ask him to call you once I talk with him but I don't have your number in London.
32	Two questions, what is your phone number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these guys?
32	Thanks, Mike
33	I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.
33	We need to assign someone in our group to be the technology lead.
33	I know we have people on it but we need to pick someone to be responsible and then clarify that person's role.
33	Please get back to me with the selection.
33	Thanks, mike
34	Allan, Please call Fred and discuss.
34	Thanks, mike
35	Pam, I'm following up on a few old items.
35	Did you get what you needed here?
35	I was in Asia when I originally got this and didn't hear anything back on this.
35	Thanks, mike
36	I'm fine with it.
36	mike
37	Thanks and have a great holiday.
38	I think he is an excellent choice if he has time.
38	Will he have help?
38	Enron North America Corp.
39	By the way, I still couldn't open this.
40	I hope some of these help.
40	They are similar in nature but may have different pieces inlcuded in them.
40	I recommend flipping through them quickly and eliminate extras or ones that you don't need.
40	Call me if you need anything else.
40	mike
41	George, below is my first cut at the brief announcement.
41	As we discussed imay be combined with a Jay and Allan announcement but never the less it wilgo out friday evening.
41	Please make recommendations and return as soon as possible for my review.
41	Thanks, mike George Wasaff, MD for Global Strategic Sourcing, will be moving direct responsibility for his entire organization from Enron New Works to Rick Causey,s organization.
41	This global group has been very successful indeveloping and executing its new business and we believe that this is thebest fit in the organization to complete its aggressive goals and objectives.
41	George will report directly to Rick Causey.
42	Thanks, I'll keep my ears open.
42	mike
43	thanks for the follow-up mike
44	Ted, Thanks for the email.
44	It looks like bad luck again for lunch.
44	I am out of town again.
44	Life is crazy right now.
44	Look for more on Enron and Enron Net Works in the near future.
44	We are busy.
44	Thanks and i hope all is well.
44	mike
45	Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination Activities Contact List.
45	This is being prepared for a wider distribution, therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.
45	The purpose of this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.
45	Thank you.
45	Mike McConnell
46	Greg, a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.
46	I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, personnel responsibilities and key action items.
46	I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments.
46	Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.
46	You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a couple of weeks.
46	He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.
46	He has others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper already).
46	Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run: Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck (advice and discuss additional resources).
46	I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned.
46	I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
46	I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.
46	I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
46	I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon.
46	Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective?
46	A few thoughts, see you tomorrow.
46	mike
47	Greg, FYI.
47	I'll give you a full update on Monday afternoon via voicemail.
47	We are on our way.
48	Monica, This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides for the future.
48	One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to the general public.
48	Normally what we do is present the story but do not include hard copies with the conference hand outs.
48	mike
49	Thanks.
49	Enron North America Corp.
50	Cathy would you please review daily for updates and make the changes on a running list.
50	I'll read for info only and you can update them.
50	After I read them and waiting 1 day, I'll delete from the system.
50	thanks, mike
51	Cedric, As a follow-up to our meeting, below are a few comments and ideas regardinthe Net Works piece of the analyst presentation.
51	I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages inthe various presentations that I think may be appropriate for the presentation (or pieces of them) including: ?
51	Why Enron?
51	?
51	Recent Enron eCommerce Experience ?
51	Lessons Learned ?
51	Business Strategy ?
51	Target Market Criteria ?
51	Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.
51	We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business (obvious).
51	Clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst meetings.
51	This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm (eventually).
51	Especially with Jeff,s comments with the analysts.
51	Thisshould be emphasized with the metals piece.
51	The concept is that here are 2new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses andindustries.
51	Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different thanall the other 15 existing sites.
51	All of the others are charging 3% fees fomatching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of transactions.
51	We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $(we,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pricomponent (this piece will be free). This piece will not be ready for July25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (shouldbe out by end of 3rd qtr.). I believe that the link with Net Works with bopaper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture than just metals alone. Also for your information, we are working on 2 acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coulbe announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since we will have access to physical pulp and paper. Paper must be an important piece of the presentation. Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he cananswer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions. He can be reached at ext. 36635. Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder; put Lumber underneathpulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others arein "incubation" and examination stages. Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latestversion and I,ll add additional commentary. I will be in all next week. Thanks, mike
52	Mark, as discussed this morning.
52	When does Cedric get back?
52	I can go through them in more detail but I thought these would help.
52	mike
53	Mike, Thanks for the response.
53	Yes, I would like a complete review of your initiatives.
53	Please call Cathy at 36898 and get on my calendar for a 1 hour update.
53	Thanks, mike
54	Rebecca, Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.
54	A large bulk of the signatures that are required come from two areas; Infrastructure and ENA.
54	I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business units made corp VPs: Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.
54	Can we make this happen and when would it occur?
54	Thanks, Mike
55	They look fine to me.
55	There is a lot there - not.
55	I know that is the plan, i'm kidding.
55	mike
56	I don't think you got a copy of this.
56	mike Andrew, please make sure Jeff gets a copy of all of everything.
56	He is the Office of the Chairman sponor of the vertical and will be managing this process with Greg Piper until launch.
56	I stepped in while he was out of town on holiday.
57	Rebecca, Ouch.
57	Thanks checking, sorry for being out of the loop.
57	I'll let Philippe know, although he should have already been aware of this.
57	Mike
58	FYI.
58	I got this from mike late last week.
58	Any comments?
58	It looks very early in their development but Mike may want them to talk to a couple of people here about their site.
58	We need to be helpful if it will help his business.
58	Dan are you up to speed on this?
58	If not please call him and get his viewpoint as well.
58	Mike
59	Guy, FYI.
59	Is anyone familiar with this?
59	Mike is looking for some feedback.
59	It looks very premature and not worth a lot of time but he may need us to talk with them to help him with his business down there.
59	Any comments?
59	Mike
60	Steve, Here is an email from Mike.
60	Are you up to speed on this?
60	What do you think?
60	Please provide some quick feedback via email.
60	Thanks, mike
61	Thank your email.
61	I am forwarding it on to Robert Jones, VP of HR for the Net Works group and he will make sure that it gets wide distribution for possible positions.
61	Mike McConnell
62	FYI, please forward as you feel might be the best fit for consideration.
62	mike
63	please set up a time for us to meet.
63	meet only.
63	please put him in front of some meeting so it cant go on to long.
63	thanks, m
64	I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.
64	The presentation would be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?
64	Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as well.
64	Mike McConnell
65	I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking place July 24-26.
65	Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses (and a few other possible verticals and market places).
65	Please provide me with these 3 specific items of information.
65	1.
65	Total market size for your business: e.g.
65	Pulp and Paper is approx.
65	$300 billion.
65	2.
65	Your target market share of that total 3.
65	Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to see I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.
65	Put any explanation that you feel is important or needed.
65	Also please quote the source of the global market size.
65	When I get all the information, I'll go through it with everyone.
65	We also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.
65	Data storage Grains Petrochemicals Steel Logistics Thank you for your quick response.
65	Mike
66	Mike, I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able to talk.
66	How about Friday @ 10am?
66	Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a direction.
66	I did review the email, and passed it on to others.
66	I do not see much from this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the market.
66	If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.
66	Thanks, Mike
67	Mike, I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this effort.
67	I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they agree with our general thinking.
67	Have you talked with Louise lately?
67	We are announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).
67	Maybe this will apply to these guys, someday.
67	Certainly it is not appropriate now and with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.
67	My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.
67	I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.
67	I really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal pending.
67	Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can take them through EOL?
67	If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.
67	Thanks, Mike Enron North America Corp.
68	Steve, FYI, here was my response to Michael.
68	I was surprised that you didn't know about this but i probably shouldn't have been.
68	Let me know if you have a different opinion.
68	Mike
69	Gary, Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.
69	I don't think that I sent this to you when I got it.
69	If I did please ignore this.
69	D'Arcy Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot of people there.
69	He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.
69	On a recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.
69	Coffee, Orange Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.
69	D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.
69	Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.
69	A phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.
69	He knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.
69	Mike
70	CP, would you please follow up and get the right forms to fill out.
70	I willgive my $5k.
70	thanks, mike
71	Lisa, I am now catching up with some old emails (I've been out of the country for quite some time).
71	What is the status on this.
71	What got approved and how much?
71	Do we still need more for Ted?
71	Mike McConnell
72	Thank you for the email.
72	I have forwarded it on for people's consideration.
72	Mike McConnell
73	Richard, Life does move on!
73	What is Malcomb thinking!
73	Can you imagine intentionally working for and believing in Jonathan Legg?
73	Hope all is well.
73	Mike
74	Steve, Thanks for the voicemail.
74	I was surprised that you were not up to speed (although I probably shouldn't be).
74	Please talk with Joe and get is view on this.
74	I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.
74	Certainly he wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help with that.
74	Let me know if you get any other news.
74	Thanks, Mike
75	Jeff, FYI, I just got this from Tom.
75	We don't have a very big opportunity here!
75	Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.
75	Not that i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should put as market size?
75	Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?
75	What do you think?
75	He is the only one to give me a number yet.
75	I am going to discuss it at the staff meeting.
75	Mike
76	John, We have discussed i2 in the past but we need to take some action steps to make decisions and move forward.
76	Here is what I want to see done in short order.
76	Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and functionality with complete demonstration by i2.
76	I would especially want PB, JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group.
76	Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders: GP - P&P; TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel; JF - New Markets and Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.
76	During that meeting, we need to have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.
76	It would be good to actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.
76	i2 owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts and solve any logistic issues.
76	Put together an action plan.
76	George's group has already put a presentation together about i2, the products and possible applications.
76	George, please sent that to John.
76	I would like that document to be our updated business plan for i2 to be used as a "living" document as we move forward.
76	Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those products (utilize our $10 million spend).
76	I want someone to have the responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are doing also.
76	To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not using the products.
76	I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this investment fully utilized.
76	I do understand that we don't drive businesses around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an option.
76	Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.
76	He would be the guy to work with and set it all up.
76	EBS should be involved as well.
76	Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well.
76	Is there an application for all of EES and their business?
76	Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works.
76	PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group to work on this that is fine but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen.
76	Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.
76	If you need to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the priority, please draft up and I'll send out.
76	Mike
77	Market size is in the presentation, thanks.
77	I want you to pick the number you want me to reference as our potential market share target and a potential margin number extrapolated from that.
77	Please respond ASAP with what you feel comfortable with.
77	Thanks, mike
78	Its on my calendar.
79	Here is a draft of the Jay announcement.
79	What do you think?
79	mike
80	Jay, I like it.
80	Two questions.
80	1.
80	You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups, specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups.
80	2.
80	You still called it Steve's group.
80	Do you want to address the issue more directly or leave it more ambiguous?
80	What are your thoughts?
80	mike
81	Greg, FYI, This is a draft org announcement to clarify Jay's and now Alan's roleWe have discussed this before but I think this is important to send out andofficially address.
81	It is intentionally very brief and informs people of the new situation.
81	Please let me know if you have any comments, I would like to send out this week.
81	Thanks, Mike At Enron Net Works, it has become clear that we have a tremendous opportunito utilize our unique strengths, skills and new business efforts across anentire new set of opportunities being created in the private equity marketsBecause of this, we have reorganized the Enron Net Works Investments Groupwith the view to leveraging the group better across strategic opportunitiesin the eCommerce and technology space, and within Enron.
81	Effective immediately, Jay Fitzgerald will take responsibility for settingENW,s investment strategy and the implementation of that strategy.
81	Repoto him in this new role will be Steve Horn and the venture investing group.Further, Alan Sommer will be joining Jay,s team to focus on developing nmarket opportunities, with a focus on working with the various domestic andinternational Enron business units to develop eCommerce-related businessesand strategies.
81	Jay will be relocating to New York city and will be working both out of theNew York and Houston offices in his new role, and can be reached at jay@enron.com or by phone at either (212) 702-3934 or (713) 853-9914.
82	Jay, Howdy from Houston.
82	I bet it is cooler in NY.
82	I don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except I changed the word "his" to "the" investment group.
82	As far as other clarification of duties, I don't have any issue with it, but every CEO will call me and ask if this is a change in how they deal with Alan or investments.
82	What is the status with Steve and how the group is organized?
82	Did you talk with him and let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration?
82	Is that your official assigned work number?
82	If not, we need to get one assigned before the email goes out.
82	Also, I am assuming that this is in the MG office not the small Enron office, is that accurate?
82	Greg and I both think that the MG office is the best location and will help them assimilate with Enron.
82	Thanks, Mike PS, good luck in the move
83	Jeannie, Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we believe was successful.
83	My kids loved it.
83	The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I do.
83	I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much time here at Enron.
83	I have two children Claire - 9 and Michael - 6.
83	They both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the actual day.
83	Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.
83	Also they really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like these.
83	Mike
84	CP, please forward quote to JDF for their consideration.
84	mike
85	It looks fine.
85	Thanks, mike
86	Mary, I would say a couple of things.
86	I describe Enron's unique culture using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.
86	Each one of these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.
86	I hope this is what you were looking for.
86	Mike
87	Jeff, I discovered this on my email this morning (I couldn't sleep).
87	I didn't know where you were on the numbers for the presentation but I thought I would forward this to you know.
87	I hope you already had what you needed here since i am sure it is too late.
87	Mike
88	Thanks for the update.
89	Greg and Jeff, I like the presentation.
89	I see you solved the matrix problem and got it down to 8 pages.
89	Greg and Mark, good luck on the analyst meetings, we'll look forward to our stock price increases from your presentations.
89	Mike
90	Bill, Thanks for sharing this letter.
90	I am always moved when I read things likethis and unfortunately I see a lot of them.
90	Who is her mom, someone that works for us in Omaha?
90	Would you please let me know via email.
90	Thanks for supporting her in her cause and efforts.
90	Mike Enron North America Corp.
91	Greg, Yes, I am their guy.
91	I have extensive info and feedback forms on them.
91	We definitely need to talk.
91	Please set up a 30 minute meeting with Cathy 36898 and we can go through it and i;ll give you a copy of all info.
91	Thanks, mike PS congrats on ClickPaper.
91	The site looks great, you and your group accomplished a lot in a short period of time.
91	I know that the big test day was yesterday and hope all went well.
91	Enron North America Corp.
92	Julie, thanks, mike
93	Fred, I haven't heard anything from you since this email.
93	Have you made any progress on your update?
93	I still believe this has a lot of merit and would like to hear your perspective.
93	Mike Enron North America Corp.
94	Scott, I was following up on a few old items, has anyone contacted you from Enron?
94	If yes, please let me know, if not please resend email and i'll follow-up to make sure you get a response.
94	Thanks, Mike McConnell
95	Andrew, How's the working coming?
95	What is your view of where we are.
95	Thanks, Mike
96	Steve, Sorry for the slow response but I got the latest word on voicemail while out here in SF.
96	They completely screwed up my order, not Ron the guy from Mercedes USA, but the dealer.
96	Ron has stepped in and followed up himself and I'll be receiving a 2001 in late August/early Sept..
96	He is a good guy and is trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball.
96	My sales guy that blew it is no longer in that job.
96	Hopefully it will be coming soon.
96	I'll believe it when i see it but I am very excited and it was a real let down in June when it didn't' arrive.
96	Thanks for asking.
96	We'll talk soon.
96	mike
97	Chris, Thanks for the email.
97	I certainly understand your situation and perspective.
97	Give me a call when you return and we can discuss it.
97	We do have a lot going on in Net Works and we may have some additional clarity on our direction and priorities when you return from your trip.
97	Thanks for your tips on SF and for offering your home in the wine country.
97	Maybe we can take you up on it another time.
97	Mike
98	Matt, I did receive it and sent it on.
98	If you don't hear anything please let me know.
98	Mike
99	Bob, Thanks for the email and invitation.
99	I am out of the office traveling right now and must get back to you on my availability.
99	Mike
100	CP, check out my emails!
100	As you can tell my trip wasn't all fun.
100	I was obviously able to make the system work from the hotel - finally.
100	I left a few emails from various speaking forums.
100	Would you please follow-up on them and delete items that we dont need anymore.
100	Thanks, Mike
101	Pop, I got this today but there wasn't any message, was this a test?
101	You are so high tech now!
101	Mike
102	Joe, Thanks for the email.
102	Project Summer does bring up some big questions and issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.
102	We'll talk later and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.
102	On your other issue, I understand and we'll discuss.
102	Thanks, mike
103	Joe, It worked great, thanks for all your help.
103	mike
104	FYI and evaluation, attached is a business plan from the CALME group.
104	Please let me know what you think.
104	They are trying to play ball and sent this to us.
104	Also they are beginning to call me.
104	I had planned to send this to you while I was out but it wouldn't go thru properly from San Francisco.
104	Allan, please give her a call and let her know you received it and let her know your overall impression.
104	By the way, Karen is David Haug's new fiancee.
104	Thanks, Mike
105	CP, I want to get this out this afternoon, after hours.
105	I want this to go to ENA, ENW and executive committee.
106	Mark and David, Below is my first stab at the organization memo.
106	I didn't over focus on specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups that will be affected.
106	I believe we need to address all of them by name and they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.
106	I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with regard to the successes from the group year to date.
106	Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New Works organization.
106	I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my departure from Net Works.
106	After you guys pretty this up (and destroy it) please send it back via email and i'll make sure and coordinate with Whalley.
106	Thanks, Mike
107	I see we passed $100,000,000,000!
107	That's a lot of zeros.
107	Congratulations, who would have predicted this when you got called back from your plane trip to work on this new trading idea.
107	You should be very proud.
107	We all are.
107	Mike
108	Mark, Here is the org memo draft we discussed.
108	I sent it to you yesterday but found a rejection notice on your address this morning.
108	Here it is again.
108	I'm in all day and tomorrow if you want to discuss.
108	Mike
109	Steve, Sorry I missed you yesterday.
109	There is a lot going on here and in S America and we can probably discuss it next week.
109	I agree with your assessment of and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan.
109	We will address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to wait a little.
109	If you have any questions you can address them with Joe but I would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects.
109	I like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week.
109	Thanks, mike I am in most of next week.
110	David, Thanks for the comments and updates.
110	I didn't know exactly how it was structured.
110	I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.
110	After I get that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works pieces.
110	I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee right now.
110	I am assuming the same is for Lavo.
110	There may be an appropriate time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be considered then.
110	I don't think they want to add any additional people at this time.
110	Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will add it.
110	I do think we should add that Mark is Chairman of all the organizations.
110	Thanks, Mike
111	Mark and David, David I got your latest comments this morning.
111	I like them and added the correct Enron Net Works changes.
111	I will send this to Greg and Jeff immediately to work on the ENW piece, I am sure they will add to it and change it.
111	Thanks, Mike PS; Mark, I haven't seen your draft, what do you think about this one?
112	Greg and Jeff, Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.
112	I am sure you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW.
112	Please provide your comments and I'll make sure they get included correctly.
112	Thanks, Mike
113	David, Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios.
113	This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in the country.
113	Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for Enron.
113	This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any interest in his company or it's products.
113	I do, however, need someone to follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any interest.
113	We need to respond in some manner.
113	I forwarded this a while ago but he didn't hear anything.
113	He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big supporter.
113	I hope there is an opportunity here.
113	Thanks, Mike
114	Matt, I did send on your email to 3 people at EBS: Ken Rice, CEO; David Cox, MD; and Kevin Garland, VP of investments.
114	They are all out of the office thru next week.
114	If you don't hear back from someone in a couple of weeks, please let me know.
114	Thanks and good luck.
114	Say hello to my good friend Robin.
114	Mike McConnell
115	Nice presentation, I'll give other comments later.
115	mike
116	Kelly, I talked with Rebecca.
116	This list is fine, I have no changes.
116	mike
117	John, I like the report.
117	Nice job.
118	Jeff, Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.
118	I told him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - also the speakers are first rate.
118	What do you think?
118	If you are interested please let Steve know.
118	I told him that I thought everyone was busy.
118	Mike
119	Jeff, yet another email.
119	This article just got re-written but obviously needs to be updated.
119	What do you think about putting in your name on this?
119	Mike
120	Cool!!!!
120	What a great head start on this years effort.
120	The Doug Leach team is off to an award winning start!
120	With matching thats $10,000.
120	Thanks and good luck, Mike PS, I'm done and part of the team.
120	Announcement out soon.
120	I am really looking forward to working with you.
121	man you're fast.
122	Mark, Thanks for the updates.
122	I have big news; I'm changing jobs.
122	This is not announced yet but I am moving to the wholesale group with Frevert to become CEO for a new business unit called Enron Global Markets.
122	It will contain the global commodities including Crude and products, coal, LNG, weather, insurance, FX/interest rates/equities, etc. I think MEC is very cool and i am glad we are pursing it.
122	Please keep Philippe, Jay and now Jeff McMahon in the loop.
122	Good luck with this and I look forward to hearing more about it's success.
122	Please keep this news to yourself until next week.
122	Thanks, Mike Enron Investment Partners
123	FYI, please make sure someone takes a look at this and atleast provides a response.
123	Thanks, mike
124	Steve and D'Arcy, Here is the short version of the Net Works story that was presented to the analysts.
124	Also please forward to Kish.
124	Thanks, Mike
125	D'Arcy, Attached as requested is the copy of the public information on EOL.
125	mike
126	This email was sent to me by mistake.
126	I didn't read it once I realized it was sent to me in error.
126	Mike McConnell
127	Allan, Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.
127	We need to follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the number 2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.
127	He is a Ken Lay buddy as well.
127	Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply respond and say thanks no thanks.
127	We just don't want him to think that Enron blew him off.
127	Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time.
127	Mike
128	FYI, please make sure he understands you should get all this information.
128	thanks, m
129	Nicki, Can you believe that we will be working together again soon?
129	Chris, Claireand Michael were up last week for lunch and we all came by to see you but ocourse you hadn't moved yet.
129	It will be fun.
129	On the memo, I am fine with it and like the changes Mark put on the drafts.I do have 1 issue to talk to him about and that is the emissions piece whicnow appears to have separated from the coal group.
129	I will talk to him abouit and see why that has changed but other than that business call, it is fine.
129	I was just with Skilling and I think he is ready for it when you geteveryone's comments.
129	Mike
130	David, Thanks for the email.
130	On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our new group.
130	Paper will remain in NA as well.
130	Both will be re-examined at some point but not now.
130	I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.
130	Who is better, Cindy or Hoyt?
130	Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation?
130	Thanks, Mike
131	Thanks for the email.
131	Reorganize and grow this business?
131	Not me??!
131	Upon first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core business.
131	It will be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big way.
131	A lot of people have tried to make this business work.
131	I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.
131	By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in chemistry.
131	He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the edges) with this project.
131	I told him about it and he really would like to get invited to the next meeting.
131	What do you think?
131	It always helps to have an avid supporter in a new business.
131	Mike
132	Tom, as we discussed, attached is the ENW presentation from the analyst show.
132	It was nice getting caught up.
132	mike
133	Greg, Listed below is a brief outline of some of the key items that I turned overto McMahon.
133	I didn't attempt to put down anything but a reference point buhe has the files and we went through every point.
133	We didn't spend a lot oftime on the international activities because a great deal of it might not bpart of the group after project Summer.
133	He attended my (his) Monday staffmeeting and he got a flavor of the group and what everyone does.
133	This isgoing to be primarily Philippe's meeting now but he is going to attend toprovide needed commercial balance and if he does, I believe that is all thetime he has to spend on that side of the business.
133	I hope you are having a successful trip.

134	Congrats to you also.
134	Hopefully we will get a chance to work together more often.
134	I'll give you a call on my next trip to London.
134	Mike
135	Thanks.
135	I'm looking forward to working closer with everone.
135	Lets get together for dinner.
135	I'll ask Chris to call your better half.
135	Mike
136	Mark, Thanks for the email.
136	Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our group.
136	I've really enjoyed working with you and your group; I think we have a great group.
136	I know you that you are working on this side of the business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and direction.
136	Cheers, Mike Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe
137	Wade, Thanks for the email and invitation.
137	You never know when I may show up!
137	I look forward to learning more about this and how our groups work together.
137	Is John's group doing a good job for you?
137	Mike
138	Fred, thanks for the info and I am going to give it to several people to look at.
138	I do need to move our meeting.
138	I'lll be in touch to reschedule.
138	Thanks, mike
139	David, you can take me off the distribution list now.
139	Thanks, mike
140	Tom, Thanks for the email, Stan said the same thing!
140	It does make llife interesting.
140	Hope all is well.
140	mike Enron North America Corp. From: Tom Shelton 08/01/2000 08:43 AM
141	Steve, thanks for the email.
141	I will not be attending.
142	Jeff, FYI and consideration, here is another speaking oppt!
142	Jeff S. is the keynote and our group has participated with Bob, Suzanne's husband, before.
142	This is the conference when we came out with EOL last year.
142	mike
143	All, FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and commentary.
143	I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org changes.
143	I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious reasons.
143	Mike
144	John, Thanks for the email.
144	It was great hearing from you.
144	This job will be fun and it will be odd to return to the energy business after my last year in technology and the new economy.
144	I am glad to hear that all is well with you and your family.
144	I don't have a trip planned currently but I am sure I'll be in London at some point during the year.
144	I'll give you a call.
144	Cheers, mike
145	Louise, I do agree.
145	I haven't really looked at or studied the plan because of the pending changes.
145	There are some good guys down there and I believe they can do some good work to help you in your quest for world domination.
145	Good luck with this.
145	Cheers, mike
146	Jonathan, Howdy (that's Texas for Cheers) from Houston.
146	Thanks for the email.
146	I dothink there is a lot to do in Japan and all of Asia.
146	I won't be a strangerIt is a very interesting job and it was a tough decision to accept it.
146	OnJeff, we decided to do this as a package deal.
146	I think he was ready to trysomething different and we'll make a good team.
146	Good luck and I'll see you by the end of the year.
146	Mike
147	I would be happy to participate.
147	I think you will really like this, it is worth the time.
147	It was the best training I've ever attended.
147	I hope you are having a great holdiay.
147	Mike Enron Technology
148	Jay, I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated.
148	The way I had it, AS, PB, DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in 1 call) all attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and co-ordination.
148	I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.
148	I suggest that all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the business opportunities.
148	I believe they are a great resource for future development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we really helped them.
148	Good luck, Mike
149	Ted, thanks for forwarding.
149	They are great.
149	mike
150	Joe, of course, I'll ask Cathy to set up a time for a call.
150	I hope all is well.
150	Things are crazy here, crazy but great.
150	mike
151	Cool, I don't know what it tells me but I love it.
151	It looks like a map of world domination!
151	Mike
152	Jennifer, Thank you very much for your email.
152	I can still watch everyone's success!
152	I enjoyed working with you and your group.
152	Best of luck to you in the future.
152	Mike
153	Jeff, do you know this publication?
153	mike
154	Brandon, what is the status of the dash?
155	Bob, I hope all is well.
155	I appreciate your thoughts of including me and sending me emails but I need you to take me off your distribution list.
155	This type of emails are not allowed at Enron and there are consequences with opening them.
155	I hope you understand.
155	Mike
156	Stuart, Thanks for the email and raising this issue.
156	While reading it, I must admit I was very surprised.
156	I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 games this year and I hadn't noticed it.
156	I just called Cindy Olson and left her a voicemail with your concern.
156	I will not forward your email and I will respect your privacy request.
156	When I hear from her, I'll let you what she says.
156	Thanks, Mike
157	Greg, Thanks for the email.
157	I hope all is well with you and your family.
157	I appreciate you including me in the notice.
157	This really makes you realize what is truly important.
157	Mike
158	Thanks for including me.
158	Sorry I was unable to attend.
159	Randy, Thanks for the email.
159	Yes, life is wild at Enronville.
159	It was a very difficult decision to leave this group but I am enjoying my first week.
159	I keep up via old channels with your company.
159	I am so glad that it all worked out and I know you will have continued success.
159	I'll give you a call when things settle down.
159	I hope all is well with you and your family.
159	mike
160	Brandon, I told McMahon that I would sign it so please forward on to me for execution.
160	Thanks, mike
161	Jonny, Thank you so much for the email and kind words.
161	I was very moved by it and you know I feel the same way.
161	I have become very reflective with the more "success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.
161	I am so thankful and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual, it has grown more deeply.
161	I see so many people that have lost their perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received.
161	Chris and I often discuss how we can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.
161	The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.
161	Thanks, and give my love to your family.
161	Mike PS: What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the works?
162	FYI, mike
163	Kevin, A quick question before our meeting.
163	Didn't we have a little different form that you used at HPL?
163	I thought I remembered a little different version of the Contract Approval Sheet.
163	One that had more detail and description of the risks.
163	Thanks, Mike
164	Dave, Per my voicemail.
164	Please give me a call on this.
164	Mike
165	Dan, Thanks for the email and quick response.
165	I am in the process of discussing this with various people.
165	A couple of observations that have become clear and I want to pass them on to you.
165	Overall, the size of the transaction is not going to fly.
165	If we brought in other players and significantly reduced our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.
165	Rick Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.
165	I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been reconfirmed this morning.
165	I understand that the deal is very active and needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we will not take the entire deal.
165	Last night George stated that he may not want to tell them that and I agreed.
165	But upon reflection, I think that needs to be re-addressed.
165	The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal potentially closed with these guys.
165	Also having them assist in bringing others to the table might be beneficial.
165	I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.
165	Mike
166	Dan, I have read the Synfuel marketing plan, it is excellent work and I would like to see this duplicated (or amended) with AIG or other concepts like this as they develop.
166	Thanks, Mike
167	Pup, That sounds great to us.
167	I take it you are not bringing the kids.
167	Have you already made reservations and a tee time?
167	Who else is included in this?
167	Also, am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans!
167	Mike
168	I agree, congrats.
168	mike
169	Lea, I like this and it gives us something to start with.
169	Let's us this as a "living" document and expand it with the thought that we can present this to Ken as a presentation.
169	A few thoughts: Add a section of what the collection will not be.
169	e.g.: not so contemporary that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.
169	Understanding that not everyone will ever agree on everything Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.
169	For example: 5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1 large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.
169	Present a few artists as options and ideas.
169	Key trading areas: could be modern and high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as a balance.
169	pick artists as an idea.
169	Address key themes: trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx.
169	Describe the area reserved for Enron memorabilia?
169	General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've already addressed List out options with front entry area (Nevelson) Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection: for example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline: e.g.: 20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas.....
169	Timeline and the need to start now Update: RC set up and ready, funding by Andy Fastow I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.
169	With Jeff and my new responsibilities, we have even less time to spend on this then before.
169	We should discuss and address now so that it is fair on you and we put that plan tougher as well.
169	Thanks, Mike PS: I'm sorry but I forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had.
169	If you still feel strongly about it send me an email and I'll run it through the channels.
170	Paula, Thanks for the email.
170	I do have a question.
170	I am talking with these folks because of your personal reference but how does this work with Project Summer.
170	Although we don't talk about this, I have heard (not first hand) that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the deal.
170	I don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise What is the scoop?
170	Mike
171	Jeff, Attached is the first draft of the first organization announcement.
171	Please add your changes, ideas and corrections and return to me.
171	Once you have provide comments, I'll send to sally and Brent to make sure all of the that part is accurate.
171	Also I have a call into Jere confirming the move on the Corp insurance piece.
171	I didn't but in anything about Cindy Skinner, go ahead and add that as well.
171	Please don't hesitate to make wording changes.
171	I don't have any pride of authorship here.
171	Thanks, mike
172	This year may be more fun.
172	We are very thin and if our QB goes down or doesn't perform, it will be a long year.
172	It will definitely be more fun however.
173	Dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers.
173	He was a very nice man and his sudden death woke us all up about our priorities.
173	mike
174	Sally, Below is a draft of the official organization announcement that will address Brent and his team.

175	Love, mike
176	Greg, I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.
176	I am sure they need your help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate experiences.
176	My thanks as a Sig Ep.
176	I just changed jobs within Enron (again) and have had a wild and difficult morning and your email made me chuckle.
176	I have done a few things at OU, and may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you are talking about.
176	The business school took some pictures and so did the Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor do i know what they did with any they took.
176	If you are talking about a formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for some reason.
176	Thanks for the chuckle, mike PS: I have been called a lot of things including "that God damned McConnell" but that is as close as it gets.
177	George, Thanks for the email.
177	Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think.
177	When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.
177	Also include Jeff Donahue.
177	You are aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail before we move forward with Pacificorp.
177	Mike
178	Everett, congrats!
178	mike
179	John, Thanks for your outlines.
179	Here are a couple of others that aren't kid related.
179	The Choice is just 1 small piece but I love it.
179	Actually, The Choice moved me so much, I sold my piece of the business (Excel) and returned to Enron - the rest is history.
179	Enjoy, Mike PS - We are way to similar!
180	Greg, Thanks for the clarification.
180	I guess I was too serious and in a business mode.
180	By the way, I don't have any photos, all they would do is scare people, especially me.
180	Mike
181	FYI, are you aware of this?
181	Were you planning to attend?
182	Thor, Thanks for the email.
182	The timing of it is amazing.

183	Also what about tickets for the game itself.
183	Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need to begin?
183	Mike
184	Gary, FYI and consideration, Billy Lemmons called me on this guy.
184	It sounds like we should talk to him.
184	mike
185	I sent this on to Gary and Jeff.

194	FYI, mike
195	Yes, I thought it went well also.
195	We can find a way to get a long term commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the price risk.
195	On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.
195	If it is put in a way that due to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring loop, I don't see how people can object.
195	It is not a trust situation but an additional reference point.
195	We are here to help.

212	Her email address at home is mmccontex@aol.com.
212	Say hello to Bob.
212	Mike
213	I think so, you saw the email i sent this morning regarding india.
213	You must visit there so we need to have it atleast long enough for you to visit!!!!!!!!
214	Stuart, A quick second follow up.
214	I talked again with Cindy Olson and she has discussed the issue in detail with the Astros organization.
214	They are going to think about this and examine for next season.
214	They did say that this was the first time this was brought up but they want to be sensitive and will consider at change.
214	Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
214	Mike
215	Virginia, A follow-up email to our earlier discussions.
215	I have been out of the country.
215	I was unable to pull up the images you sent to me and my home email address.
215	I am interested in the Matisse and would like to see the image.
215	On the Liechtenstein, I like the one you had and would be interestein talking if you could find another.
215	Please let me know if you can find one.
215	Also i would appreciate you sendinanother image of the matisse.
215	Thanks, Mike
216	Can you please arrange for this message to be sent to all of Enron - Houston this evening.
216	It should have Mike McConnell's letterhead and we would like an opportunity to preview the final message before it goes out.
216	Please contact me at X-36898 if you have any questions.
216	Thanks.
216	Cathy Phillips It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.
216	I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.
216	As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.
216	Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.
216	Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.
216	Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.
216	JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.
216	Enron's goal this year is to raise $225,000 and we need your help.
216	Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!
216	We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.
216	The theme for the walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.
216	The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.
216	If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.
216	If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.
216	Thank you very much for your support.
216	Mike McConnell Steering Committee Members: Cathy Phillips X36898 John Walt X35379 Debbie Yates X35305
217	Mark, The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.
217	If their time is coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.
217	I have had very little actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their effectiveness.
217	mike
218	Thor, I've been out and forgot to call you back.
218	sorry for that.
218	I'll take a look at the plan when it comes in and if there is some other information that Jeff or I want to see, we'll let you know.
218	Thanks,
219	FYI, I've had a meeting with oxley on this.
220	Ron, Thanks for the great news.
220	Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just received.
220	I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you again.
220	The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very pleasant distraction.
220	I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.
220	I will have all my lease information with me.
220	I have a few months left on the lease and will have all the needed information to complete the transaction.
220	If you would, please forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side dealership.
220	I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.
220	Also I don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in that part of the dealership now.
220	I expect a fair price for my car and with our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.
220	I am confident that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal with my cash purchase for the CL.
220	I guess I just need a name at the dealership.
220	Thanks, mike
221	Congrats to all.
221	Jeff and I believe that EOL is a vital part of growing our businesses and your focus is appreciated.
221	mike
222	Great, Enron North America Corp.
223	Great, I am very happy you are a supporter.
224	Thanks!!!!
224	That is a great start to the campaign, you're a pal.
224	mike
225	Wanda, Thanks for your story and support.
225	We will have great event again this year.
225	Let me know if there is anything I can do with your business unit to help you.
225	Mike
226	Thank you for your note and help!
226	I look forward to seeing you at the walk.
226	mike
227	Vanessa, Thanks for the note.
227	I'll check out the book but I don't think I'll stop my insulin!
227	mike
228	If he is waiting on me, please have him send it out.
229	CP, what do you think of this draft.
229	Too close to last year?
230	George, I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 credits.
230	This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will have approval issues with RAC and others.
230	I want Jeff and/or I in the meeting.
230	Thanks, mike
231	Joe, Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with INGAA in Tokyo.
231	I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.
231	There are some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.
231	Bill Smith, CEO of Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements and will be going to Tokyo.
231	Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is worth his attendance.
231	I thought you would be the best answer to that.
231	I also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in Japan.
231	Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.
231	He can fill you in better on the details.
231	Your call.
231	Thanks, mike
232	Thor, I'm out of town again and will calll you another time.
232	I plan on bringing the plan on my Asia trip which begins on Sat.
232	Both Jeff and I will read it then and provide comments.
232	Thanks, mike
233	Robert, Attached is the draft review for Steve.
233	Please review and make changes/corrections as you believe are necessary.
233	I could use the help, this is a tough one.
233	Please let me know your views on the tone and message as well.
233	I will give him the actual review when i get back from Asia.
233	Thanks, mike
234	John, I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.
234	I ran out of the office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff for my trip.
234	Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and are in the office for a while this afternoon.
234	I'll give you a call a little bit later.
234	If your call is urgent, please don't hesitate to give me a voicemail if our time zones don't match up.
234	Thanks and sorry for the delay.
235	Jeff, I don't know if you got this.
235	What do you think?
235	Interesting background and info for Net Works or our moving into the Chemical business.
235	mike
236	Mark, Attached is the information you requested for your presentation to the analysts.
236	I didn't know exactly what you were looking for, so I listed out a lengthy laundry list of facts and philosophies for each group for you to pick and choose what information and style that you wanted.
236	I didn't attempt to put this in a final set of dot points.
236	I realize that this is a lot more than what you wanted but I didn't know your other pieces or what was needed to be consistent with the other sections of the presentation.
236	I hope this is what you were looking for and i apologize for the delay.
236	If you want anything else or more specific types of other information, please let me know via email or preferably via voicemail in Houston.
236	I'll be Singapore until Wed.
236	evening when I arrive in Toyko.
236	I am 13 hours ahead of Houston time.
236	Thanks and have a good trip.
236	Let me know if you want me to look at a draft copy.
236	Mike PS; good luck with Eric "boy do i want to be in LNG" Gonzelas
237	Hello from Singapore.
237	Thanks for the email.
237	I am interested in the Lichtenstein.
237	Is the #4 the same as the one you had in the gallery?
237	What is the price and what does the frame look like?
237	Do you have a picture or could you put it on your website?
237	I am still interested in the Matisse but Chris isn't so sure.
237	We are still thinking about that one.
237	Thanks, Mike
238	Thanks I know they are meeting but didn;t specifically know about LNG.
238	I'll let you know lhow it comes out.
239	Cool, This is a big deal and a deal we should highlight as an example of our vision of the future.
239	Congratulate the team.
240	Thanks, understood and good luck.
240	mike
241	FYI, project Dragon.
241	It looks like it is done.
241	i replied that we understood and it was fine.
242	My passport number is: 132871136.
242	Cathy Phillips can answer any other questions.
242	thanks, mike Enron North America Corp.
243	Rex, If i am no longer a section 16 officer, do i need to be removed from this list?
243	What is the status?
243	Thanks, mike
244	Mark, Ouch, that stings.
244	Hopefully you are the only one that knows!
244	I know you can close the deal anyway!
244	Mike
245	Virginia, Thanks for the update.
245	I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right now.
245	I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events in the middle east.
245	I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however, I do want to know more about the price.
245	I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a lot less.
245	Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.
245	Is there room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.
245	The ebay price is significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet either.
245	If you can't get them down on the price, it is worth me chasing down the other option for a while.
245	Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time zones.
245	Thanks, mike
246	Beverly, Wow!
246	Fantastic.
246	Thanks for sharing your success and letter.
246	mike
247	Don, Howdy from Tokyo.
247	Thanks for the email.
247	It was great hearing from you.
247	I would be happy to talk with you in Dallas about your business.
247	In the mean time, why don't you send me a new email (without the personal stuff) about your company and references to your website and i will forward it to the appropriate people within Enron with a note to insure that it gets the proper attention.
247	Thanks and see you soon.
247	Mike
248	Marty, Thanks so much for your email and support!
248	I apologize for the slow response but I am in Asia and have had some difficulties keeping up.
248	You don't need to worry about the matching, I'll take care of it all.
248	We are making this hassle free for the supporters.
248	Thanks again so much.
248	mike
249	Joe, I enjoyed it as well.
249	We all have a lot to do and money to make!
249	I got a long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the ePower side.
249	He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well.
249	Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.
249	He left me a voicemail that he has been working with ePower quite a bit and has talked about 2 LNG facilities.
249	i told him to work with you.
249	Cheers, mike
250	Carol, Thanks for the email.
250	Please send it to the office upon your receipt.
250	On the coat, I don't have time to think about it now.
250	Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
250	mike
251	Rick, Obviously we want to control access to the LNG terminal.
251	I don't really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation item.
251	Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free.
251	After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more involved.
252	thanks, i like the letter.
253	Jay, Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of the draft review I prepared for Steve.
253	I would appreciate your views and please make changes you feel are necessary and appropriate.
253	It is set up for Thursday morning at 9 am.
253	I could use your help.
253	What do you think?
253	mike
254	Jeff, You're right.
254	I missed it.
254	Go ahead and send yours back with the Singapore operations and current trading operations exclusion and mention that I agree with your assessment also even though i said fine earlier).
255	Doug, Sounds fun but I can't commit now.
255	Please do not wait on me, go ahead and fill up the foursome.
256	Sally, Thanks for the email and update.
256	I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.
256	I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.
256	I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).
256	We cant lose that momentum.
256	I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.
256	I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines.
256	Please keep me up informed on this matter.
256	Thanks and good luck with the students.
256	mike Enron North America Corp.
257	FYI
258	fine, sorry for the delay.
259	Charlene, Thanks for the email.
259	I have talked with Sally several times on this lastcouple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedulethen other schools.
259	Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future aI have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on that trip.
259	I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe thatfrom an OU perspective it may be a mute point now.
259	Doing that should be abto maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexihas done.
259	By the way, the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was verysuccessful.
259	If you have any other questions or comments please let me know.
259	mike
260	Gary, Thanks for the email.
260	Here is my attempt to type out a response.
260	I hope it helps.
260	1.
260	It was a matrix organization.
260	The IT personnel reported into the Global Tech.
260	group but we did that for communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control.
260	They attended business unit staff meetings and the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant feedback.
260	It was vitally important for the "customer" to be happy and that the IT person completed the projects from the BU.
260	When it came to the review process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.
260	2.
260	When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day working of the IT world.
260	IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly created 5th business unit at Enron.
260	Remember Global Technology had more that IT alone.
260	We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing around the world.
260	Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.
260	He is in the office of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly appointed COO.
260	Both LK and GW are non IT people.
260	There are many VPs on the next level that are IT executives.
260	3.
260	In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the world.
260	He chuckled and said something like, "That sounds like Enron, it always looks at things differently. He then stated that my CEO title and Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place soon, as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize it and change its culture".
260	4.
260	When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.
260	For example, we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it for free.
260	Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was going great.
260	We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.
260	Gary, I hoped that helped.
260	Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions.
260	Mike
261	i'm all for it.
261	Please move forward.
261	He is a great guy but don't forget he is happy in his current job and all of this must be carefully done for him and not to disrupt his current job.
261	Let me know how it is progressing.
261	Let's follow the book and proceed properly.
262	Thanks, it was great and long over due.
262	The cold and rain didn't stop the ultimate enjoyment including 35,000 people chanting "over rated".
262	It was great and we must enjoy it until the Sat.
262	when reality comes back to the sooners and we lose the next 2 or 3 straight.
262	K State, Neb and Tex A&M.
262	Ouch, nice 4 game stretch.
263	I like that schedule.
263	the game was great!
263	The cold and rain couldn't effect my enjoyment.
263	long over due.
263	Reality comes back on Sat however.
264	Gary, There were two such events.
264	On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on technology.
264	None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.
264	It inspired me to keep going on a "nontraditional" path.
264	The other big impact moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of Cisco.
264	It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, "its a matter of survival" speech.
264	That really hit me and our conversation was also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.
264	He gave me a positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron in the eCommerce world.
264	It was going to take a different kind of technologist.
264	That moment had the most impact on me of the two.
264	I saw John again and spoke with him at an Economist conference in Laguna Nigel and told him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.
264	He also was very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.
264	I hope that clarified things, good luck with the piece.
264	Thanks, mike
265	Thor, A quick note.
265	I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather business plan.
265	I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while traveling overseas.
265	I read it again today and wanted to give you some feedback.
265	I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.
265	Thank you for all your effort.
265	I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of our other businesses.
265	I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to discuss some of the ideas you presented.
265	Mike
266	Congrats!!!
266	I'll see if i can make a combination trip.
267	Thanks.
268	Rick, Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am putting together for EGM.
268	I would appreciate your comments on the presentation but especially need your input on your section.
268	The LNG page is on page 6 and needs some work.
268	there is also a typo.
268	On the graph, we need to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
268	I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.
268	After we complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
268	Thanks, Mike
269	George, Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of a first draft of a presentation that i am creating on EGM.
269	This is for an upcoming analyst presentation and for our ongoing use.
269	Please review and make any comments you feel are needed.
269	Especially focus on coal which is on page 5.
269	Please take a quick look and return your initial comments quickly.
269	I need to get out a new and better draft ASAP.
269	Also, how do we illustrate your business graphically.
269	Please decide, fill in and I'll have our graphics guy make it look pretty.
269	Thanks, mike
270	Larry, here is the publication we discussed.
270	If you have an interest, let this guy know.
270	Thanks and welcome aboard.
270	Wes Colwell is looking for an office.
270	Right now there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1 office on finance floor.
270	Do you have a preference, if we have an option?
271	liz, I can't believe it - although he will never show!.
271	I would be happy to fill out a form when it comes out.
271	Hope all is well.
272	Cool, nice job.
273	Good point on extra space.
273	Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.
273	I think that makes 33 less of an option.
274	Try John Paveto at 57038 or George Wasaff at 67351
275	Virginia, Thanks for the email.
275	I apologize for the slow response.
275	Life is crazy and I have been back on the road again.
275	I am interested in purchasing "Blue Note" and I understand that the price is $4,500 framed as before.
275	I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have stated before, but have not closed yet on it.
275	It is significantly less but I have not closed the deal.
275	I would like to own the piece.
275	Do you think there is any room on the price from your seller?
275	I will commit to you but I can't leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience.
275	That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.
275	I will commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.
275	you can tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that price.
275	I don't know if that works for you or the seller.
275	Please let me know what you think.
275	I am in this week.
275	Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
275	I am ready to make a decision.
275	Mike
276	Ron, Hello.
276	I am back in the country - I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked up the car.
276	I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very well.
276	The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car before I went off to Asia.
276	I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.
276	I have had many comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of Enron purchases of Mercedes.
276	I am a Mercedes believer.
276	Sincerely, Mike McConnell
277	Dan, Thanks for your donation.
277	I appreciate your support.
278	Erin, here are a couple of responses.
278	Please rewrite as you see fit.
278	Mike 1.
278	Agriculture.
278	We are currently looking at and studying the industry.
278	We have traded some commodities as well.
278	We believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.
278	We have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy.
278	This is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area.
278	I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.
278	Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.
278	2.
278	Rail.
278	We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses.
278	I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of rail.
278	It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.
278	Dan Reck is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US.
278	Erin Rice@ENRON
279	Joe, we are both there.
279	I am also going to Dubai and Jeff will go to Australia.
279	I'll be in the night before and out the morning after.
279	Hope all is well.
279	Cathy is co-ordinating everything.
279	Looking forward to it.
280	Gary, this is the guy we talked about.
280	He is worth atleast a look.
280	Ex Cargill.
280	Please meet with him.
281	Please put on Jeff's and my calendar for 30 minutes.
282	Thanks, mike
283	Jim, I think it does.
283	I am usually unable to attend so I would really like you to stick with this as our rep.
283	Also we will talk about the best uses of your time after this weeks budget meetings.
283	I'll give you a call.
283	Thanks, Mike
284	Doug, Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are provided as a service to save money.
284	By the way, saving money is real money to Enron.
284	Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can put it in context?
284	Thanks, Mike
285	Virginia, Thanks for the email.
285	Go ahead and send it unframed.
285	I don't remember what the frame looked like so it will probably be easier to send without.
285	For my later reference, how much do you charge for framing?
285	Mike
286	As discussed.
287	Gary, I turned 40 in March.
287	Thanks, MIke
288	Greg, I need to talk with you about your EBS/fiber project.
288	Please give me a call in the morning.
288	I'll be in first thing in the morning.
288	I don't have your telephone number.
288	You are listed on a Houston number.
288	Mike
289	Dana, Thanks for the call and email.
289	I will look at your resume and get back to you .
289	Mike
290	Cool!
291	I thought you would enjoy this.
291	PS bring the magic dollar to lunch!
292	Bob, I don't want to wait for Mike, please set up the meeting without him.
292	He can join us by phone if needed.
292	Thanks,
293	Guys, Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the latest analyst presentation.
293	We kept it to only a few businesses - they didn't end up using any of it.
293	I do however want to have an EGM presentation that everyone can use.
293	Please prepare a section on each of your businesses and return via email or hard copy.
293	Don't worry about power point, simply the dot points that you want on the page.
293	Thanks, mike
294	John, We're getting old.
294	mike
295	Jeff, I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.
295	Your presence is needed more than I thought.
295	My gut told me that they really needed your help but its more than that.
295	Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.
295	They will learn or they will be out.
295	mike
296	Jeff, Let me know what you think of this guy.
296	Wade Cline and Tim Det.
296	are both high on him.
296	Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.
296	During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.
296	I think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process.
296	He could also report to us obviously (like Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a lot of sense.
296	What do you think?
296	If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.
296	I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.
296	He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.
296	Mike
297	Jeff, Sorry for the slow response.
297	I don't have a strong opinion either way.
297	I am fine with the combo idea.
297	In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.
297	I am still slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.
297	I am almost caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and best way to communcate.
297	Thanks, Mike
298	Cool!
298	Thanks for sharing that with me.
298	See you at the walk.
298	mike
299	Gary, 1.
299	Correct 2.
299	Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for all of it's employees.
299	Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.
299	The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.
299	It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance.
299	The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources.
299	It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.
299	Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC.
299	3.
299	I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way.
299	An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology.
299	and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.
299	I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage.
299	It was a very customer driven (internal and external customers) process.
299	It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center.
299	I hope that helps.
299	Sincerely, Mike
300	Bob, Thank you very much for supporting our effort.
300	mike
301	Cool.
301	Thanks for sharing that with me.
302	Jay, thanks for the donation and commitment.
302	the check should be made out to JDF.
302	We'll do all the matching.
302	Hope all is well.
302	mike
303	I didn't call rick.
303	did you?
303	What do you think?
304	Rick, I am scheduled to be out on vacation but I think you should have the meeting if it still fits peoples schedules.
304	I am doubtful but will look at later.
305	Jeff, what do you think of this guy's background?
305	Do you know him?
306	Angela, by the way I was not CEO of ENW I was Vice Chairman and COO.
306	Whalley was and is CEO.
306	Please correct if possible.
307	Good idea.
308	I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.
308	As flattered as I am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.
308	I am very proud of our accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology group but my tenor was only about a year.
308	In August I was asked to take on another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.
308	Although this was an even more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave the technology world.
308	Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and innovation.
308	He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.
308	Sincerely, Mike S. McConnell
309	jim, i don't really have an opinion but i certainly won't get in your way on the approval.
309	mike
310	Happy Halloween guys!
310	I am sorry I am not there, I really wanted to see a beautiful butterfly and a Harry Potter.

310	I love you, Daddy (the King)
311	Howdy from Tokyo.
311	Please add this to my calendar and send a fax with all of my new commitments and parties to chris via home fax.
311	thanks,
312	Dana, Hello from Tokyo.
312	I sent you a reply and forwarded your resume to our HR group.
312	I don't know if you got my reply the day I received your resume.
312	I have had a lot of people tell me that they didn't get a response from me about the same time as you contacted me.
312	My sent mail doesn't list you as a completed return email.
312	I hope all is well.
312	Mike
313	What about David Turlip?
313	Also are there some other general announcements and or clarifications that you want to address?
313	eg mid marketing, other new efforts or goals for the upcoming year.
314	Gene, thanks for the follow up.
314	I am definitely interested in talking with him.
314	Please set up and co-ordinate with Cathy Phillips @ 36898.
314	Also need him to talk with Jeff Shankman.
314	Thanks, Mike Enron North America Corp.
315	Please send on and co-ordinate a 30 minute meeting with Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen for discussion.
315	They might be able to use him as well.
315	Thanks,
316	Guys, what do you think?
316	Any ideas or interest?
317	FYI
318	Jim, I just wanted to thank you for participating in the walk.
318	It means a lot to me.
318	Thanks for your support.
318	See you out there.
318	Mike
319	Another one.
319	Any ideas?
319	Coal in Asia?
320	Cindy, I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.
320	The company is on a roll and offers an interesting product.
320	I have attached his email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring it up to you.
320	Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.
320	Do we do anything like this with our employees?
320	I would really appreciate some feedback on this.
320	Unless you think it is a total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate members of your HR team to attend 1 intro.
320	meeting to listen to their pitch.
320	I would of course attend as well if you like.
320	They have an impressive customer list already.
320	Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.
320	Thanks, Mike
321	please co-ordinate and make sure that Lea has your email address for distribution.
321	thanks,
322	Rick, While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.
322	The bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves.
322	We need to look into this and I would like your initial opinion.
322	This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.
322	He believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.
322	If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.
322	Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?
322	Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.
322	Sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.
322	Mike
323	Thanks for the update.
324	FYI.
325	Cindy, I don't think we have a fit here but would you please follow-up and let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything.
325	Also please forward to other groups as well.
325	Thanks, mike
326	Hi, I noticed that there are several people missing from my personal address list.
326	Would you please check to make sure it is up to date and add missing directs.
326	L Lawyer, J Nowlan, B Price, add T Meyers, R McDonald.
326	There may be more.
326	Thanks,
327	David, Any update from your last email a couple of weeks ago?
327	Thanks, Mike
328	How about my emails!
329	All, I haven't heard back.
329	Please respond to the email.
329	Let me know if you didn't receive it.
329	Thanks, mike
330	Louise, I was clearing some old emails.
330	What ever happened with this guy?
330	Did you hire him or blow him off?
330	Thanks, Mike
331	John, What exactly are we trading here and how do you think it is going?
331	mike
332	Brent, I would like this to become formal policy within EGM as well.
332	I know that it exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it works.
332	We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out a policy like this for us.
332	Please take a look at this and draft a memo that can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and limits around them.
332	Thanks, mike
333	Christine, I so rarely write love notes.
333	17 years ago it was common place, even a daily event.
333	What happened to that guy?
333	I could have been a cartoonist in another life.
333	I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying by China, soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.
333	You said something very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the airport.
333	You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by yourself.
333	I can certainly understand that.
333	I seem to have a l lot of that on this trip.
333	I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.
333	I wish I could be there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out trick or treating.
333	I bet they look great.
333	As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality and realize just how lucky we really are.
333	I turned to Ken Rice at the ceremony yesterday and said, "What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV. The Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is out of a job on a no confidence vote last night. (Really bad luck for Enron here) I would have liked to have met him. Actually, the ceremony was neat and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it. You should see me in a Happy coat. I'll explain when i get home. Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even imagining what are lives are like today? We are so blessed. Even more than that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and wondering why God let me find you so many years ago. I must have been a priest in a former life. Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this airplane. Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email. Although I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the internet. I love you and miss you very much. Eternally, Michael See you soon and in time for soccer.
334	Cool!
335	Sorry I am not aware of anyone in particular.
335	Good luck, I believe that there are huge opportunities for you out there.
335	Mike
336	Joe, I think the entire event was outstanding.
336	I also enjoyed it but my hand still hurts!
336	Ken went through it today at the executive committee and he talked about the incredible potential and the job you were doing.
336	Congratulations again, mike PS Weekly calls are a favorite of mine as you know.
337	please do.
338	John, FYI and consideration.
339	Eric, I was examining EGM's businesses for 2001 and I wanted to ask you a question about your specific business.
339	As you examine your goals and objectives, I would like to know what you think I could do to help you accomplish your plan.
339	Please send me a return email with 3 specific items that I could do personally to add to your business.
339	Thanks, Mike
340	For your further handling.
340	I don't know what this is.
341	Greg, a quick note, although a little unclear, all of your businesses remain in EGM and are not going to go to R McDonald's new group.
341	Please inform your group.
341	Thanks, Mike

343	Ahmad, Thank you for the email.
343	I enjoyed our visit very much.
343	I wanted to thank you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away from your family.
343	I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the Dolphin project.
343	I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put together in the Middle East.

343	Thanks again.
343	Mike
344	John, Thanks for the email.

374	Jim, Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.
374	I know how difficult your job is day to day without items like this popping up.
374	I spoke with Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so appreciative it is hard to describe it.
374	The school constantly talks about Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now printers.
374	Thanks again and have a good holiday.
374	Sincerely, Mike McConnell
375	Mark, FYI, here is the latest update on our Q4.

376	Thanks, mike PS good luck with the game on friday.
377	William, I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross.
377	A few questions about the pieces.
377	You referenced Meier Graefe for "Pan" for both pieces.
377	I don't know what that means could you please clarify?
377	Also I don't understand the reference to an Album.
377	Is the Signac numbered?
377	Are either signed on the stone?
377	Thanks, mike
378	Karen, yes i like the "sauces" reference.
378	I sound like an idiot.
378	I can understand his mistake but i thought i discussed what it meant.
378	Skilling will love that reference.
378	mike
379	Pelt, Howdy from Houston.
379	I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
379	I took the week off and it was what i needed.
379	I have been working at a hectic pace and was on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.
379	I needed the break.
379	My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.
379	Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
379	I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.
379	We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a while ago.
379	Our spring break is March 12-16th .
379	Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.
379	I figured that you are in Telluride right now on holiday.
379	Give my love to all.
379	Mike PS - How about those Sooners!
379	OU/TX wasn't a fluke.
379	Hard to believe, we'll see what will happen with K State and bowls.
379	No matter, its been a fun year.
379	It is nice to be back.
380	Howdy, Kansas City will be great.
380	Thanks for the invite but I can't go.
380	I pray that the Nebr.
380	Sooners show up, not the Sooners of the last 3 weeks.
380	We really look awful.
380	Early peak?
380	That's great news for spring break.
380	Let me talk to the boss and let her know that is still and option and see if it still works.
380	Thanks, Mike Go Sooners.
380	Shame about Hipel, he has thrown away his Heisman over the last couple of weeks.
380	Do you agree?
381	Assistants - Please remove this brief note and then forward this message frMike McConnell to everyone in your group today.

387	I glanced at it and it appears fine from my perspective.
387	Others should make the determination on its effects in the Spanish and European markets.

390	Thanks.
391	Thor, Very creative and i bet everyone had fun.

391	Thanks for sharing the story.
391	mike
392	Thanks for the email and kind words.
392	I did recover over thanksgiving and it was nice but I am sick once again and cant' sleep.
392	I am catchin up on this emai at 2:15 wednesday night.
392	I will try and go back to bed after this email.
392	Let me know how the contract goes, i don't see any issues.
392	I actually thought it got done and that is why i havent heard anything.
392	Sooners have looked ugly lately, Saturday will not be a good day for the Sooners.
392	Mike
393	John, You caught me.
393	I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.
393	I did promise Chris that I wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I couldn't do a lot of emails from home!
393	- there is always a catch!
393	Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.
393	Hope all is well in merry old England.
393	Cheers, Mike
394	I couldn't sleep so ive been doing emails, its looking a little better.
394	And I didn't get up in the middle of the night and come into the office.
394	I think I'll try again and can still get a few hours sleep.
394	I will be in a little later than I expected, I must drop young Michael off to school and cant leave there until 8.
394	See you in the morning.
394	Sleepy
395	Jeff, I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.
395	Not my favorite past time at 2:30am.
395	I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a while.
395	Please send it to me for my review.
395	I think it is important to get something out and i believe that people expect some changes Thanks, m.
396	Elise, Thanks for the email.
396	In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron Global Markets.
396	I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).
396	Please remove me from your email list for further HTC events.
396	Thanks and good luck, mike
397	Chris, thanks for the email.
397	I don't have a need.
397	Thanks for letting us know.
397	mike
398	Jeff, attached is an expanded 1st draft of the memo.
398	I would like to keep this expanded format to show the progress that we have made in the group.
398	Please make any changes and send back for the next round.
398	After we both look at it 1 more time, we will circulate to the heads of the group for commentary.
398	I would like to have them feel part of the memo.
398	Mike
399	Jonny, Howdy, I bet you had a great time at the game.
399	I did watch it and it never felt good and I am still amazed at the outcome.
399	Did it feel different actually being there?
399	Are you going Miami?
399	Mark and I may be in. What about you?
399	I figured for sure that you are already making plans.
399	Also, do you think it will be impossible to get tickets?
399	We are in for spring break.
399	We will not be able to be there the entire week and we are looking at the exact dates and my schedule - but count us in. If you get a chance why don't you give me a call and we can catch up.
399	Mike PS - Enron stock was down $15/share, ouch.
399	No partiuclar reason mainlly huge sector movement.
400	RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.
400	1- the Var on this deal is over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of the size, and they know we are working on it.
400	and 2 - EE&CC; they were concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM treatment.
400	I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and that we probably won't use them.
400	They stated that the deal guys are acting like EE&CC is a done deal.
400	Lets discuss.
400	Thanks, mike
401	You've got to have faith.
402	Brent, I would like to illustrate the growth of our commodities to show why this a great business unit and why this is a big focus for wholesale.
402	Also we will use all of this for the Jan analyst meeting.
402	Please compile some facts on each business by 1.
402	number of transactions 2.
402	revenues 3.
402	on line growth of each 4.
402	size of each commodity; e.g.: number of barrels traded, tons of coal, tons of freight, etc. 5.
402	other metrics that you think will illustrate the point Go back as many years as you can get data.
402	Thanks, mike Go ahead and send me preliminary copies of the figures as it is being compiled.
403	thanks
404	Interesting guy to look at.
405	Cliff, Thanks for lunch.
405	I always really enjoy getting together and talking about life and our businesses.
405	Attached are the two presentations we discussed.
405	A little airplane (or boat, sorry, ship) reading.
405	I would appreciate any feedback.
405	I'll be making significant changes as I get ready for the analyst meetings.
405	Thanks, Mike
406	Don, Howdy, Yes I am going to Miami.
406	How could i not go!
406	I still cant believe it actually.
406	Sorry I 've dropped the ball on setting up a meeting with your company.
406	I did talk with Cindy Olson, HR - EVP and she would like to meet.
406	I just forgot after our last exchange.
406	Please send me back and email with your telephone number and I'll have Cathy Phillips my assistant set up a meeting.
406	Thanks,
407	CP, Please call and set up a meeting time for 1 hour in Houston with Cindy Olson.
407	Don will also bring others.
407	Please set up.
407	Thanks,
408	Pup, Mark and I are confirmed with flights.
408	Chris is not coming.
408	Where are you staying, any good hotel ideas.
408	Mark had a room for 1 night by the stadium but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around Miami and therefor may want to stay closer to the city.
408	Any thoughts?
408	When are you guys flying in?
408	mike
409	George, thanks for the email and update.
409	We do want an update on a daily basis but don't want you to spend time typing everything up.
409	I think VMs are faster.
409	thanks,
410	Jeff, Sorry, I can't participate on Saturday.
410	I have serious commitments that I can't break specifically on Saturday.
410	I know that we are short people and I do take this process very seriously.
410	Mike Enron North America Corp.
411	Ken and Kevin, Attached, for your information, is a copy of a general presentation that I prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.
411	This is a presentation that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and growth.
411	I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.
411	With all of your history on these businesses, I thought you might be interested in our approach and description.
411	Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.
411	Mike
412	Cliff, Here is a revised version with typos corrected.
413	Joe, I have been reading about ePower and potentially building sites.
413	I know you are clarifying it's activities but until then, I have instructed my guys to respond to ePower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.: possible LNG re-gas plans for ePower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you as well.
413	Let me know if you want something different or want me to email other instructions.
413	Thanks, Mike
414	I double clicked 1 person away on my personal mailing list.
414	I noticed it right after it was sent.
414	Thanks.
414	m
415	May help on hotel rooms
416	John, thanks for the comments.
416	Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot.
416	I like the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final determination in Q1.
416	I also think "softs" is a big oppt that is probably worth pursuing.
416	More later.
416	I like the weather idea as well.
416	On another note, I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium.
416	He runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.
416	He has attempted to talk to someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.
416	He has given me his email address and requested a contact.
416	Would you please make sure that someone follows up with him.
416	Thanks, Mike
417	Paul, Thanks.
417	I am making changes and taking out the word "trading" wherever possible and I will send you a revised copy when it is ready.
417	Mike
418	Thanks, m
419	Thanks.
419	Not impressive.
419	mike
420	Eric, is this still a problem or did you get what you needed?
421	FYI.
422	Rachael, I left him a couple of voicemails with feedback including answering some of his questions on Joe.
422	mike
423	Yes, CP, please include.
424	All, Here is the latest draft.
424	Please make any changes you want and return.
424	Paper mark up is best.
424	Also please leave as a separate word document if you do it via email for ease of changing and converting to email late afternoon.
424	Cathy, please review for your normal grammar and corrections.
424	I realize that this is a draft but it will help to have your changes early even though we will be making additional changes in the afternoon.
424	Larry, I would like your feedback and commentary as well.
424	Thanks, mike
425	Jeff, Below is an email from John.
425	Please let me know how to respond.
425	I know yoguys talked about this.
425	Thor was in the loop here wasn't he?
425	I know we toout the Thor reporting piece but in reality they do report up through him.
425	How many people do we expect in London?
425	John and I did talk about this and I didn't really think of it lately.
425	Mike
426	What do you think?
426	He came very highly recommended from Amanda via voicemail.
427	more from amanda
428	Jimmie, Thanks for the email.
428	Sorry for the slow response, vacation.
428	I am out that day but i really appreciate the invite.
428	Happy holidays.
429	David, Thanks for the nice note.
429	I hope you and your family are having a great holiday season.
429	Please don't hesitate to call me if you come in for a meeting, it would be great to see you again.
429	Sincerely, mike
430	Brent, Excellent update.
430	I would like to see the breakdown by pieces for a potential write-down especially volume difference only and look at a 1 year adjustment to begin.
430	Thanks, Mike
431	All, I am developing the presentation for the upcoming January analyst meeting.
431	EGM will be featured.
431	The presentation is being compiled, and everyone has provided input on the overall EGM presentation, but i am also developing my speaking and emphasis points.
431	With that in mind, please send me a return email with a few dot points that you want me to be sure an emphasize regarding your business.
431	I have given a few specific areas below but if you have any other general items please don't hesitate to add them.
431	Key customer benefits Enron competitive advantages Key growth areas Deal example(s) Thanks, Mike
432	John, I hope you and Lorraine are having a great holiday season.
432	Sorry for the slow reply but I tried to only work on critical items over mholiday.
432	Yes, this is only a marketing desk and it really only includes 1person, Ross, who doesn't want to move to Oslo.
432	I didn't think it was a bthing and that is why I didn't get back with you.
432	It wasn't a big part ofthe memo and i didn't focus a lot on it.
432	I would expect him to co-ordinatedaily with Thor.
432	I believe he works for Thor but we didn't address it inthe discussion or memo.
432	I'll watch it and see if it becomes an issue.
432	I dknow that Mark and Thor have talked about it and I believe Thor likes Rossand is OK with his function in London.
432	We are not attempting to recreate the wheel in London or around Thor.
432	See you when you come to town.
432	Mike
433	My January is very bad, how about early Feb?
433	Mike
434	FYI
435	Pup, Hope your holiday is going great.
435	Talked with your office and got your Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.
435	OU game is coming quickly.
435	Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.
435	We are out on Thursday afternoon.
435	Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.
435	It should make for a fun trip.
435	When are you guys going down and where are you staying?
435	We need to set up a time to get together and to get the tickets.
435	Have you heard anything on Hieple (bad spelling) arm?
435	If he is healthy I would take the points!
435	We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.
435	We plan to fly out on Tuesday and return on Saturday.
435	I have a scheduling problem to get there any earlier.
435	Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.
435	I've got a very light schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.
435	See you in a couple of days!
435	Love to all, Mike Go ENE stock, we back to 85!
436	cool.
437	Thanks, I had not seen it.
437	Happy New year.
438	Greg, thanks a lot for your help.
438	This is a great surprise.
438	mike
439	Pelt, we are at the Hyatt - Coral Gables: 305 - 441-1234 Mike
440	All, I came back from the big dance last night.
440	It was a real privilege to be there.
440	I've been to 15 OU/TX games and the energy, excitement and overall electricity in the orange bowl beat them all put together.
440	It was wild and a moment that I will never forget.
440	Bob Stoops for president!
440	He is the king.
440	The best was at the end of the game (and everyone stayed around celebrating until about 1:30 am) when they said, "there was the Wilkenson era, there was the Switzer era and welcome to the Stoops era. Oklahoma is back".
440	Boomer Sooner, Mike
441	Thanks for the email.
441	The game was great and my throat still hurts.
441	I've never been to a better event or had as much fun.
441	I'll be calling Roberts.
441	mike
442	Jonny, Wow what a week.
442	I still can't believe it.
442	I will have the video in mail overnight on Monday.
442	Sorry for the delay.
442	Let me know if you got another copy and don't need it.
442	Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.
442	It was fun being with Trey.
442	I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating Madeline's birthday.
442	I can't believe you have a teenager.
442	We are getting old.
442	I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned the price of the ticket.
442	$175!
442	I didn't realize that when you gave it to me.
442	I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.
442	I didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they were that much - I 've never been to the big dance before.
442	If your dad wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.
442	Please let me know the situation.
442	Cheers and Boomer Sooner, mike
443	Mary, I would be happy to talk with anyone about this.
443	The story did have some mistakes.
443	Tom was correct in his statements.
443	By the way, I never saw the draft before it ran.
443	I think I would have caught the errors.
443	If I saw it before the printing, I must have simply said ok without reading it but neither Cathy nor i remember an email on it.
443	Mike
444	Allison, Thank you very much for the email and request.
444	As much as i an very proud of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate from Enron.
444	Enron has changed its culture and business around technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.
444	EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.
444	EOL was only 1 part of our transformation however.
444	Thanks again and good luck with your award.
444	Sincerely, Mike McConnell
445	Greg, Mark and I would like to thank you again for your efforts to get us on at Doral.
445	We had a great time and got a chance to meet Tom.
445	He was a gracious host and please pass on another thank you for us.
445	Mike McConnell
446	Yes, even better then that!
447	Thanks for your hospitality.
447	We had a great time.
447	Sooners rule!
447	It was unbelievable being at the game.
447	mike
448	Cindy, I have addressed this previously with Jeff and Louise Kitchen.
448	We have no interest.
448	Please co-ordinate with Robert and make sure that someone sends him a nice rejection letter.
448	Thanks, Mike
449	Cathy, Starting next week I want to join in. please put on my calendar.
449	thanks, m
450	Cool.
450	Tape is on the way via Fed ex.
450	See you in a couple of months and we are on for the tour championship.
451	Allison, Philippe can be contacted via email at philippe.a.bibi@enron.com or by phone Thanks and good luck.
451	mike
452	Christie, a couple of comments on the 3rd paragraph on page 11.
452	It is up to you to decide if it is worth correcting.
452	I didn't know if you had a chance to make the writing better or simply correct mistakes.
452	1.
452	Page 11: I was president of Houston Pipe Line and Louisiana Resources Company.
452	The term, "Enron pipeline subsidiary" isn't real or correct.
452	You could also restate with, head of Enron's non-regulated pipelines, head of two pipelines, head of an Enron pipeline subsidiary ; something like that.
452	2.
452	Page 11: On the 5th sentence, it is mixing a couple of thoughts.
452	I would like to add something like, (after officer,) and establishing a unified vision, 3.
452	Page 11: typo.
452	There needs to be an "an" in the last sentence before the word extension.
452	Thanks, mike
453	CP, Please forward her a bio, to save time, and schedule the time with her.
453	thanks,
454	FYI, here is the latest updated presentation.
454	mike
455	Rick, thanks.
455	I will listen in occasionally as well.
456	Doug, that is up to you and John.
457	For your followup and confirmation.
458	Now you're committed!
459	Simone, Please change the heading under the transaction summary from "Global Products" to "Global Markets".

463	I haven't even changed the wording after I first put it down.
463	Mike
464	Huskers drool over Sooners.
465	Virginia, Hello.
465	I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.
465	I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.
465	They should be delivered this week.
465	They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.
465	By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.
465	I have also purchased an Appel in the last month.
465	I am interested in several artists.
465	Actually, a lot.
465	I will be looking for one or more of the following.
465	My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.
465	I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).
465	They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.
465	I want signed and numbered.
465	I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.
465	I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.
465	For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.
465	At least that is what I am thinking now.
465	Bonnard (colorful only) Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any) Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos Braque Moore Rouault Rothko Kline Motherwell By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.
465	It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).
465	It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.
465	Is there 1 available?
465	Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one.
465	Thanks, mike
466	Actually, I believe that may be correct.
466	I verified it in the new book by Tom Osborn, How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in Coaching.
466	It was a best seller.
467	Mark, I thought you would enjoy seeing our banter.
467	Any suggestions at a good comeback.
468	Thor, I am sorry that you can't make it but please don't worry about it.
468	We wanted to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your great work in Norway.
468	We intended to only invite 3 non-EGM officers, Joe Hirl, Paul Quilkey and you.
468	I hope you have a great holiday.
468	Cheers, mike
469	Ken, I had to respond.
469	Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops not taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that will get him out of their backyard.
469	By the way, Stoops just started working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who are the Huskers?
469	mike
470	Robert, Thanks, I've talked with EES - Tom White and I will forward on his resume for consideration.
470	I will also talk with Stan Horton.
470	Mike
471	John, This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.
471	I would like to have you lay out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps to accomplish the goal.
471	I don't want to forget about this because I believe it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator or team to accomplish.
471	I would like to see foreign and domestic.
471	I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or pricing.
471	Thanks, mike
472	Howdy, I could not open the attachment.
472	Could you please resend or cut and paste it into the body of the email.
472	thanks, mike
473	I would really like that.
473	I don't have any specific suggestions.
473	mike
474	FYI, I think this is interesting.
474	I won't be able to attend but do you have any time to see some of this.
474	The morning looks interesting.
474	What do you think?
475	Marty, I can't attend and sent it on to Jeff Shankman.
475	I really like the concept and would like to see the end product and the presentations.
475	Are you taping it?
475	Its a great idea and format.
475	Thanks for inviting me.
475	Mike
476	Tom, In response to our discussion, attached is Fritz's resume.
476	It doesn't prinwell.
476	As i mentioned earlier, I have know him for many years and was hisemployee and then his business partner.
476	I exited the business when we wereready to go public (which never happened as planned).

476	He needs help and has come to me for consulting work or a job.

479	Jeff, Interesting.
479	Do you like this guy?
479	What about Crude and products origination working for Randy?
479	On the LNG front we should look at him if you like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.
479	Neal will be coming on in 2 weeks, do we need him?
479	Maybe we do.
480	Bruce, I've been out of the office until Monday afternoon since the day of our meeting.

480	I'll follow back with them and get back to you.
480	thanks,
481	Shanna, I'm supportive of the raise to $150k.
481	I think he is doing a good job and has a lot of value.
481	He didn't fair well during the ranking due to lack of big $ or closure but maybe this will send him a good message.
481	Thanks,
482	Shanna, I certainly believe that Jennifer is better than Kim.
482	Jeff is certainly the appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.
482	This comment is not meant as a cut down at all.
482	John's questionable judgement shouldn't just be trumped however.
482	My thoughts,
483	A few things that I want to make sure that we have in our briefing package.
483	A map of the region and facility Assessment of country risk address concern that a lot of "old" money (big Landowners) are taking their money out of the country - something we shouldn't ignore Update on other Ven.
483	activities for ENE Other How is this going to work with translators?

497	Congrats.
497	You guys make a cute couple.
497	I'll try to attend, it is on the calendar.
497	mike
498	Jeff, I couldn't open the attachment and there was no name reference.
498	Who is this?
499	Lea, You called yesterday.
499	I am swamped and unavailable.
499	On Jeff Koons, I am sure that Jeff talked with you last week and he shared his insight from other dealers at your dinner and his comments.
499	It sounds like we should let him go and not pursue.
499	I was going to talk with Skilling that day and elected to drop it after that.
499	See you on Monday.
499	Mike
500	Jeff, My brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume.
500	Do you know him?
500	Any interest?
500	If you do, please forward on.
500	Thanks, mike
501	Thanks, Great job, I thought the trip was great and productive.
501	Maybe next time we'll meet the pres.
502	Jeff Shankman.
502	Steve Kean will also look in occasionally.
503	Jeff, attached is Georges review for tomorrow.
503	Please review thoroghly, add and make changes and be sure to check for errors.
503	There is no spell check on the PEP system.
503	Please review and attache the document and return for signature.
503	thanks, mike
504	John, Thanks, I'll talk with him.
505	Jeff, here is Gary's review.
505	It is still on the wrong template and I'll correct today.
505	Please review carefully and make changes and return.
506	Jeff, I called Joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this.
506	I referenced the power of 100% focus and the accountability for someone driving the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity.
506	I like your email and tone.
506	I would like to recommend you add a statement about Morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to "own" him vs. having a 100% dedicated weather guy.
506	I would also add that you want to talk him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision with tawney.
506	MIke
507	George, I just talked to Rich.
507	I told him about the timing of the settlement proposal and that we should hear back late next week.
507	I also suggested that if we get a negative response, that you and i would give him a call and update.
507	He is being patient but I have a feeling that it has its limits.
507	His response is logical to this point because as he stated, there should be a lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement.
507	Mike
508	Thanks for the update.
508	We'll discuss again when I am over next week.
509	Dan, Eric hasn't called me but if he does you know I'll help.
510	I like it, that is where I am staying!
511	Approved.
511	John Nowlan will make sure that someone from Net Works sees it as well so if they get a call they can discuss it.
512	Yes it is.
512	Listening to clients, a great business model!
513	Shanna, talk with Rick but he will be working until June or July then he will retire and be available as a consultant to us.
514	Jeff, I made a few suggestions and retyped in the document for your consideration.
514	I added a few words and changed the order.
514	If you don't like them, go ahead and change them back and send out.
514	Thanks,
515	fine
516	please print in color, bind and return this afternoon.
516	thanks, m
517	Good luck and let us know, including Rebecca and her team.
517	thanks,
518	I thought you would get a kick out of this.
519	Ken, I'm back.
519	Sorry for the delay.
519	It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up on emails especially the fun ones like this.
519	My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head especially as an Enron "B" teamer.
519	In response to your worker bee comment, I can certainly say "buzz" but not someone who can sell that many shares of stock!
519	You are the king.
519	Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at least I didn't get help!
519	You win......but you still owe me lunch.
519	Mike
520	In case you haven't seen this.
520	Hope all is well.
520	Things are great here.
520	mike
521	Pelt, I thought you would like this.
521	I hope all is well.
521	Everything is great in Houston.
522	Randy, Thanks for the update.
522	I like your plan.
522	I like the McKinsey part as well.
522	Please make sure that Suzanne understands the plan and that you John and Larry agree on the way forward.
522	If there are any issues, please let Jeff or me know..
523	FYI
524	John, This just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list.
524	We will be discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward.
524	Everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to dedicate 10-20% of their time on a product.
524	The intent of this email is not to take people but to add people to the offices, if necessary, to make sure they live, eat and drink weather.
524	We can discuss when I'm in later this week.
524	Mike
525	Virginia, we did get the package but can't address right now.
525	thanks,
526	All, At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present your business and goals.
526	This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on Saturday).
526	Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday morning.
526	Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.
526	Please do not hesitate to change the list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of EGM for the Enron board.
526	After this meeting, I will take each of your presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM as a business unit.
526	Also please add some of your other specific goals that illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive position and/or market share.
526	For example, to be the largest marketer of coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or what ever is appropriate.
526	Also attached, for your information, is a recent presentation from the coal group.
526	We thought that this was an excellent format and review.
526	In the upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as well.
526	I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and format.
526	Thanks, Mike
527	FYI, there is no official meeting with Chavez.
528	Howdy.
528	Does your AOL work after I go into the work VPN?
529	Dan Reck
530	Congrats, he is a great guy.
531	Shanna, What a deal.
531	When Jonathan and I talked, he did ask if this deal with Net Works was a problem.
531	I told him that I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather than Robert.
531	Is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity?
531	Mike
532	Greg, Thanks.
532	We'll resolve.
533	Darryl, I couldn't open your attachment.
533	Please resend.
534	Thank you for your email and ideas.
534	I have kept up with some of the Strategic Sourcing activities and know that things are going well.
534	Enron's art committee's stated vision, goals and objectives are similar tothe ones you reflected in your email.
534	As I have stated on an earlier voicemail to George (I can't remember if Icalled you as well) the Enron Art committee has spent a lot of time focussing on our vision and goals for the Enron art collection.
534	This has been coordinated with the approval and support of Ken and Jeff and we have NedRifkin (Menil) and Barry Walker (MFA) advising us.
534	I believe that we aremaking progress with our goals and acquisitions.
534	Thank you for submitting these concepts.
534	We are executing on our approvedgoals and are not going to pursue your ideas at this time.
534	Good luck with your endeavors.
534	Mike
535	Thanks for the information.
535	Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
535	I know that Neal Gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be working with you on project Jose.
535	You will find him to be a great guy and a person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy industry.
535	I have known and worked with Neal for over 10 years.
535	I think he will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home....
535	the largest deal at Enron.
535	Mike
536	Thanks, no interest.
537	Don, Thanks for the email and quick response.
537	I'll address in more detail later, I'm gong out of town again this morning, but I did call Alan Kent and you will have a copy of his standard construction agreement and a copy of the deed restrictions e-mailed today.
537	Also please call Alan directly with any questions on the contract.
537	Larry is his real estate agent for selling homes in this subdivision and i believe he is just helping him.
537	Alan should be able to answer most of your questions for clarifications quickly.
537	I don't need to be an intermediary.
537	In case you don't have his numbers, he can be reached at his office at 281 376-1500 or We can discuss the other issues you addressed later when i get a chance to review them more carefully.
537	We are comfortable with Alan as the builder and want him to build the house, we just want to have a remedy if things don't go well.
537	Thanks, mike
538	Cheryl, Thanks for the update.
538	I like the progress.
538	I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least it will help.
538	What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives us a very high bid price to build the house because we are captive.
538	What do you suggest as a possible remedy?
538	Some sort of checks on allowing others to bid?
538	Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?
538	Without a cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.
538	What do you think?
538	A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.
538	2.
538	Earnest money: I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.
538	3.
538	Title policy: Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it is prudent especially with the new subdivision.
538	How much does an additional 15% cost?
538	I don't have any idea.
538	4.
538	have provided 5.
538	not sure i understand this 6.
538	yes, delete 7.
538	definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector 8.
538	add in clarifying statement 9.
538	agree to add builder obligation.
538	I am fine with a quick closing date and needs specificity.
538	Does he have an estimated time of completion?
538	10.
538	Rollback taxes: I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be protected here.
538	11.
538	add this to contract.
538	Flare may want the money but we should try it.
538	I hope this helps.
538	After you review and discuss these issues, let's get together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.
538	Please call Cathy Phillips with a time to talk.
538	She can be reached at 713 853-6898 Thanks,
539	George, what is that status of this?
539	Kinder hasn't called on this but probably will.
539	Let's discuss or leave me an email.
539	thanks,
540	I am no longer the CEO for Technology for Enron.
540	I am now CEO for Enron Global Markets and do not have any tech.
540	responsibilities.

542	Dan, FYI.
542	m
543	Peter, Thanks for your voicemail and email.
543	Your resume is impressive and I have 2 thoughts.

543	Thanks and good luck.
543	Mike
544	John, I'm sorry I missed you before you went off to Dhabi.

545	Thanks, Mike
546	Bob, I just tried to contact you but rolled to your voicemail which told me that your mailbox was full and it wouldn't let me leave a message.
546	The operator then sent me into a Nuevo message that stated that the office was closed.
546	Sorry for my late return call but I've been running at full speed since 6:45 am.

546	Also let me know via voicemail if this is urgent.

560	He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please contact him in the near future.
560	Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an asset to EGM.

569	mike
570	Thanks for the update.
571	Louise, I thought you would want to see this since you were there during all of those times.
572	Mary Nell, I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.
572	I can't imagine how you are feeling.
572	As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the teams efforts.
572	It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence!
572	No way to take this to the EU?
572	mike

576	Doug, The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was magnificent.

594	This is a confidential and internal document, which includes earnings targets, goals and objectives.
594	We have a shorter more external version thawe use to describe our businesses.
594	I can provide that copy if you are interested.

603	Also looking for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.
603	I will want to see numerous examples before I choose the Lautrec that we want.
603	If you have any Bonnards, please let me know and send a copy of the image.
603	Mike
604	Eric, incase i forgot to forward, please followup and lets meet him.

610	Thanks, mike
611	Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.
611	The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.
611	This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people.
611	We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months.
611	I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.
611	We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.
611	That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.
611	Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.
611	If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.
611	Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.
611	Mike
612	Jeff, attached below is my first cut at the org memo.
612	Please review, make additions,comments and corrections and return it via a word document on email.
612	Once i receive comments from all the individual business heads then I'll ciculate again for final review and commentary.
612	Mike
613	Thanks for the response.
613	I found a beautiful Bonnard in London and NY.
613	I will be buying in next day or two.
613	Asking price is $9,500.
613	I will keep the Lautrecs in mind.
613	I think one is in my future - next.
613	I don't think I'll be buying one for a few months.
613	I'll get back to you.
613	Mike
614	David, Thanks for the email.
614	It did cause an interesting conversation without knowing what the situation was.
614	We all have very open relationships around here (it is why we are so successful as a company).
614	Please don't think twice about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and/or myself at the same time.
614	Thanks, Mike PS; we are all thinking about P+ constantly.
615	Jeff, FYI.
615	This is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we need to make decisions on.
615	Lets discuss because I have some views but am very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what oppts really look like there.
615	We need to address quickly.
615	Mike
616	Morten Erik, Thanks for the email.
616	I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main points that we are thinking about right now.
616	Jeff and I are very bullish on the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.
616	I believe that will also drive the structure.
616	You should have received an EGM overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction.
616	I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.
616	We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the business.
616	I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.
616	I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.
616	It will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time.
616	Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well.
616	Thanks, Mike
617	Joe, As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.
617	When you get a chance to examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your views and your view of the best way forward.
617	We have everyone thinking about it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.
617	It will help with Morten Erik as well.
617	Thanks, Mike
618	Chris, Hello from Houston.
618	I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your gallery.
618	Your collection of work is very impressive.
618	I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.
618	The Bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed.
618	I found an illustration of it on the net (from another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).
618	I am prepared to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.
618	I would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece.
618	I will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.
618	When I get your response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up the email.
618	Thanks, Mike McConnell PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures I will show them to my wife for consideration.
618	I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her.
619	Kurt, I agree with Eric.
619	California is very dangerous right now and we would need something very real to bring this to his attention.
619	Steve Kean really liked the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.
619	Mike
620	John, Rick Bergsieker is the key here.
620	He can certainly direct you to the right people or others on his staff to help from Abu Dabai.
620	Rick: Houston ext: 66504 Mike
621	Sounds like a plan.
621	Eric is the key to all your activities.
622	Chris, Thanks for the email.
622	I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely help.
622	I miss understood about the photos, I thought you were sending me via email that next day.
622	Congrats on the Cassatt, that person will really enjoy it.
622	Let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance.
622	I understand that there is a shipping component and no sales tax.
622	I like to have all my art shipped because the tax savings can be significant, especially in New York.
622	I did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below ($783).
622	The price you had did include the frame didn't it?
622	Thanks, Mike
623	I look forward to it.
624	Any update?
624	How did the interview go?
625	By the way, good calls.
626	Don, Thanks for the fax survey.
626	We couldn't read the numbers however.
626	Please mail a copy to our house when you get a chance.
626	Are there any issues from your point of view?
626	I would like to understand what the limitations are on the easements but it appears that everything is done.
626	Are we ready to close and how do we do this?
626	Thanks, Mike
627	Bob and I are still playing phone tag, but he's calling.
627	Call being scheduled for Wednesday it appears.
628	Lisa, As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized that I forgot to talk about 2 people, including regulatory and your personal efforts.
628	I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.
628	I could not read my notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on my notes just on me.
628	Thanks, Mike
629	Thanks,
630	Thanks, done.
631	Joe, Attached below is a draft of an EGM update and org announcement.
631	It will be broad in scope and will address many areas.
631	Please review and provide comments especially on the Japan part.
631	I went ahead and took a stab at the first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel is appropriate.
631	We are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player (Morten Erik) that is why I left it very broad.
631	Please take a moment, change and send back to me for examination and incorporation.
631	I wanted to get this out on Friday, but may have to wait until early next week while i am on the road.
631	Thanks, Mike
632	Billy, I like it.
632	My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all your discussions with business unit head and AAs we are (changing) improving the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.
632	I think this could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.
632	Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.
632	Good luck,
633	Chris, I got the pictures yesterday.
633	They looked great and were very clear.
633	I am interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you have as well.
633	I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to an agreement.
633	What is your best and final total price for the work?
633	I will make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email.
633	Thanks, Mike PS - I am going to pass on the Braque and Picasso for now.
634	Great news!
634	Im glad you and the baby are doing well.
635	Thanks.
635	Not going to buy now, closing on a Bonnard.
635	I will have an interest later.
636	FYI and follow-up.
637	Chris, Thanks for the response and thanks for the consideration.
637	I accept and we're done.
637	I will have a check out to you today via overnight mail.
637	Please ship to: Mike McConnell Houston, Texas 77069 I look forward to doing business with you in the future.
637	I'll let you know the next time I'm back in the market for a specific piece or artist.
637	Also please give my home a call (281-895-6855) when the piece gets in the mail so that I can make sure that my wife is around to accept delivery.
637	Sincerely, Mike PS - Your price was right on the mark for an easy personal decision.
637	My wife actually preferred another piece that was slightly cheaper and this let me get my favorite piece!
638	Test
639	I couldn't print this out.
639	It was all messed up.
639	Please call try on a different printer and if it still doesn't work, get a hard copy.
639	thanks,
640	John, Attached is the latest draft for your review.
640	I changed the format on your section and some of the wording.
640	I was attempting to make this easier for some of your employees by the wording.
640	Are you sure you want to separate out Doug F from Randy's group?
640	I also added Doug L in there as well.
640	Please check the wording and spelling of everyone's name carefully.

665	Thanks.
666	Dianne, Thanks for the kind words.
666	Yes toastmaster has been a big influence in my life.
666	I talk about it often and attribute a great deal of my success to that.
666	I do large speeches quite often and its all back to our morning meetings and they seem like they were a lifetime ago.
666	thanks,
667	thanks for the update.
667	be sure and get on my calendar when you are in town.
667	Call Brent Price (our CAO) at 713 853 7647 for additional help on Mtm.
667	He is very good.
667	Good luck,
668	John, Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo weather situation.
668	Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to review it this week.
668	Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth any more of our time.
668	For what it is worth, I think our communication strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed to be.
668	These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.
668	For a P&L that is this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.
668	There is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to bigger and better things.
668	I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the other issues and problems on my plate.
668	Let's discuss upon your return on our weekly call.
668	Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing.
668	Mike ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.
669	Kathie, Thank you for your email.
669	I've been out and all over the world.
669	I appreciate your help on this article.
669	Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.
669	This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.
669	Here are a few other points of emphasis.
669	EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first 2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key!!!
669	Thanks for your help.
669	Mike
670	Paul, I am in the early stages of planning my next run to Singapore and Sydney.
670	I was thinking about bringing my wife and staying over a couple of days (or a week).
670	What is the weather like in July and are you going to be there?
670	Thanks, Mike
671	Tuesday is fine but i do need it.
672	All, After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an accomplishment list from each of you.
672	We have had a very successful 2001 so far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year in detail.
672	Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have all the facts during the PRC process.
672	This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of us for the appropriate time.
672	Thanks, Mike and Jeff
673	Randy, I would be happy to sign it with legal approval and Tim Detriming's group must also see it to make sure that we are not obligating ourselves to anything else that is going on around the corporation.
673	Maffet knows the drill.
673	mike
674	thanks,
675	John, attached below is my first draft.
675	It isn't pretty and i would like you comments and changes.
675	Please make changes directly on the word doucment and send back asap.
675	thanks,
676	I apologize for the delay in getting back to you.
676	I've been traveling againI also just found this in my in-box as returned as un-delivered (I put onlytwo v(s) instead of three. I hope your other discussions went well thatday. Below are a few comments that i believe you addressed and wanted some additional feedback from our coal activities and changes in the coal industry. I wanted to get this out to you quickly so please forgive thislack of formality or writing creativity. Enron activity (EOL) Enron's online activity has been very successful especially as compared witour early estimations of acceptance by the industry. I believe that there is only one other active coal trading system (Dynegy direct) that simply isn'tposting prices as a bulletin board and waiting for a response with telephonfollow-up. I also believe that we have done a very significant amount of omaybe all the coal transactions on Dynegy direct to date. We do a lot of obusiness online and the numbers YTD are that approx. 45% of our trades areexecuted online. That number has been higher, as much as 90% for certainmonths or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product. Also, as Bid/Ask spreads tighten, which we would expect, that bodes well foEOL and our (and the markets) ability to transact even more quickly. Transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second. Between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online businesswill significantly increase. Changes in the industry We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry. We see several things on the horizon. We expect the acceptance of the online transactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price movements what we have seen in the last 6 months. We are currently developing several new products for EOL that I believe will become very popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors. I don'twant to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thithey will raise some eyebrows. The development of the Global Coal exchanwill also help. I frankly don,t believe it will be very successful because of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the transaction. One thing has been very firmly demonstrated. Every time a newbig system has been introduced EOL volumes go up. It simply accelerates thacceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day. Another big change in thindustry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market. The significant pricchanges that have occurred have "forced" many traditional players to the OTmarket. This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms andconditions and getting them comfortable with the market. This is very goodfor Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on theOTC market. We don't release specific percentages of what we are doing onthe OTC. Also having more natural and traditional players signing these types of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market. Enron coal volumes A couple of numbers that we are willing to release. Year to date, we havemade markets and transacted approx. 30 million tons in the forward market. On the physical side of our transactions, about 25% go physical vs. financial. Last year Enron was the largest US market maker (not producer)with 142 million tons transacted. Internationally we moved approx. 47 million tons and overall the total was slightly less than 190 million tons.We have high expectations for 2001. I believe that we should be up approx65% and we are on track with that. I think the industry would be surprisethat we did almost 2,800 transactions in 2000. This doesn,t include any of our shipping business. I hope this helps and please let me know if you have any other questions. Mike
677	Eric, A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly.
677	Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d) Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals Elba - supply and managing t-o-p Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan R Bergseiker future and other EI people Asia strategy and clarification Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, facilities) I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them down and get an update.
677	Thanks,
678	Darrell, I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there was no voicemail).
678	I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact you.
678	I'm out all weekend.
678	Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG opportunity.
678	I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my thoughts.
678	Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone else in the company.
678	They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.
678	They are lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that have recently come into the group have.
678	That is why we have brought them in. We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.
678	Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.
678	The biggest opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and books.
678	That certainly doesn't mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.
678	Rick is in the process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east projects and strategy.
678	Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly he would like to do in the time of transition.
678	My very sincere hope is that he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role.
678	Especially in a big deal in Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.
678	We will discuss this next week when he comes to town.
678	I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and Bahamas immediate activity.
678	He will certainly be engaged in everything but he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.
678	Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.
678	Thanks, mike PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.
678	Also the Eric specific head role has not been officially announced yet.
679	Ron, I hope you had a good week.
679	I've thought a lot about your family and you've been in my prayers.
679	I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with this while you were away.
679	As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed are: Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles) Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking) Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission) Dr. Wayne Dyer (many) Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others) Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.
679	To my extremee frustration I can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.
679	I got a lot out of all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.
679	I am a great believer in the old saying, "When the student is ready the teacher will come".
679	As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have had a profound effect on me and my family.
679	A few direct tangible results include: my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and growing) .....
679	When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can definitely find time for lunch.
679	Mike
680	How's this for the next stab.
680	Please review, make changes and send back for a final.
680	I didn't try to make this just perfect but consoldite a little and add a little.
680	Thanks, Mike
681	Mark, Thanks for lunch, I really enjoyed our conversation.
681	Here is the presentation we discussed.
681	This is an internal presentation only.
681	mike
682	I added a couple of our other businesses in the opening paragragh.
682	Good to go.
682	mike
683	Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.
683	I want them for my files.
683	Thanks,
684	Richard, I sent your info on to my direct reports for evaluation.
684	I've also sent on to others as well.
684	If there is an interest, you will be hearing from us.
684	Good luck, Mike
685	Peggy, I'm glad you had a good time.
685	I can't begin to express my appreciation for all of your work and dedication to JDF.
685	I was proud to have you represent Enron.
685	Mike
686	Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.
686	I would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below: IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business unit heads receiving this message.
686	Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.
686	Please contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
686	New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.
686	Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
686	If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.
686	Example: Bob Smith NH Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips.
686	Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues.
686	Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
686	Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future.
686	A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.
686	The Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.
686	Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent phone (with the existing phone numbers).
686	Please contact Jennifer Burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones.
686	All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people.
686	On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow later): 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room - no videoconference 3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group.
686	Every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible.
686	At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved.
686	Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated.
686	It is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries and distribution.
686	Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to them via e-mail.
686	They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday at 4:30 p.m.
686	to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.
686	Please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
686	There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building.
686	I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time.
686	Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible.
686	Mike
687	Joe, In the next couple of weeks.
687	thanks, PS - Amazed at my quick response?
688	Tom, I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends on your view of the middle east adjustment.
688	I don't want to be hard on this and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.
688	Its up to you and your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.
688	I am fine with your ultimate decision.
688	Mike
689	Rebecca, I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.
689	He has never attended one.
689	It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially like this.
689	Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of information.
689	Thanks, mike
690	Thanks.
690	Wow, you're quick on email.
690	Jeff and I will be the only attendees.
691	I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.
691	I guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from Weed and Dial.
691	If the teams are all full, put me on their team.
691	Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.
691	My game has gone down the tubes since I started the international work.
691	I hope to take care of that problem soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.
691	I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys, Mark
692	I'd like to sign up for the ClickatHome service.

701	Mark
702	Sounds good.
702	I was in Norman this last week...recruiting, golf and KSU game (close).
702	I also picked up my tickets for this weekend.
702	I don't like thinking about the game, it makes me nervous but that is the fun of it.
702	By the way, can you tell me the line?
702	I'm sure you are favored.
702	Boomer Sooner, Mark
703	I had vacation on September 28th (Friday).

705	Jonathan, Thanks for the email.
705	I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.
705	I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.
705	Your resume looks very impressive.
705	I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.
705	I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.

707	Please let me know if you know where Christian is.
707	Hope all is well, Mark
708	Christian, How's it going in Brazil?
708	I know you are happy to be back.
708	I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business.
708	I'm working for the pipeline group.
708	The people here are very nice and I'm glad to be back in this industry.
708	Although, I must say that I will miss London and working with people like yourself.
708	I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day.
708	Do you happen to know his email address?
708	Please let me know.
708	I hope all is well down south.

714	Good luck to you guys.
714	I hope the game is a good as the hype.
714	Again, I can't wait.
714	It is such a great spectacle.
714	Boomer Sooner, Mark
715	Yeah, what a game.
715	That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.
715	Both Defenses looked very good.
715	Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.
715	I do like our coaching staff.
715	Bob hasn't always had things go his way.
715	During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.
715	That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.
715	Good luck with the rest of the season.

725	University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell.
725	Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team by the University of Oklahoma Sooners.
725	University police warn a fourth terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large.
725	However, sources within the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.
726	Let's talk about it tonight.

729	Erica, It sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation (I wouldn't have guessed otherwise).
729	The fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want.
729	Sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is.
729	I truly wish you the best and I certainly want to know where you place yourself.
729	Oh, I heard from Andy.
729	They have settled in Denver and he is still looking for a job but he may do some contract work for Enron.
729	I'm not sure how definite it is or what he'll be doing.

732	I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.
732	On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.
732	It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.
733	Yeah, Baylor this weekend and Nebraska next.
733	This Baylor game is coming at the right time.
733	Good luck with Colorado.
734	Unfortunately, I had no time off this last couple of weeks.
734	Mark
735	In the next few days.
735	We'll call you and let you know when we start the process so we can get your imput.
735	Mark
736	Noel, I will not be needing a ride to the site.
736	I will meet you and the gang out there.
736	I hope my change hasn't messed you up too much.
736	Mark
737	I have secured EN1336 for the meeting between the weather desk and TW
738	I'd like to get some right now.
738	If you know what I mean.
739	This is an asset purchase (a mothballed oil pipeline for conversion to nat gas).
739	Robert Guthrie did not attend.
740	Jim Curry attend for Robert Guthrie.
741	Mr. Joergensen, A big "Howdy" from your Texas friend.
741	I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).
741	It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.
741	I hope you and your family are doing well.
741	As EBS changed direction, I did as well.
741	I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.
741	I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).
741	I've been here for about a month and all is well.
741	The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).
741	It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.
741	I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.
741	Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.
741	I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.
741	It was a great concept and it worked.
741	Oh well.
741	We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.
741	Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.
741	Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.
741	It is a strange time here in America.
741	The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.
741	It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.
741	There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.
741	Take care Martin.
741	It was great to hear your voice.
741	Mark
742	With some kind guidance from the veterans around here, I'd be glad to do it.
742	If it can wait a couple of days.
742	Mark
743	as requested
744	I am available
745	Please look at the attached.

745	If some things on the list are not applicable, please note that too.
745	Just send your deletions/additions to me via email.

745	Thanks, Mark
746	Pat, Howdy!!!!
746	What is going on?
746	I heard from Erica that she may have some decisions to make soon.
746	Are you going through the same thing?
746	I'm interested to know.
746	I heard from Andy Maus last week.
746	He is doing some contract work for Enron.
746	He and his family are enjoying Denver.
746	Please call or email me.
746	I hope all is well.
746	Mark
747	We'll get that for you.
747	We are awaiting a call back from Questar to confirm out days in the data room.
747	This coming week looks doubtful.
747	We'll be in touch.
747	Mark
748	Jeff, If you have any problems, let me know.
748	Otherwise, we'll talk later on how to resolve this.

750	Mark
751	James, What do you think?
751	Can we do the 20 year thing?
752	I have made note to your new email address.
752	When I make it over to London again, you will be one of the first that I contact.
752	Could you send me your home number and address?
752	Great luck running the search firm, Mark
753	4707 Laurel St Home Phone 713-665-4026 Cell 713-822-4862 Take care.

754	I'll talk to you later, Mark
755	The total for the "Boss's Day" lunch = $230.

763	I got out of my morning meeting and Kim still wasn't in (~8:45).
763	I had a bad feeling.
763	She came in at 9:00, straight from the vet.
764	Howdy Heidi, Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.
764	I hope all is well with you and your hubby.
764	Awfully weird times here in the home office.
764	Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.
764	I guess it is the same or similar there too.
764	The pipeline group is working out.
764	I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.
764	Please respond and let me know what you are up to and how you are doing.
764	I'm so sorry we didn't hook up when you were in town last time.
764	Mark
765	Thanks Eric, I'll call the guy.

767	Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.
767	I told him yes but I needed to check with you.
767	I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.
767	I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.

774	Nice picture.
774	It should do.
775	It just goes to show....
775	If you just keep winning, things usually work out.
775	Good luck at Texas Stadium.
775	Mark
776	Debbie, I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.
776	Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).
776	A bit sad for a lot of other people around here.
776	As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.
776	Mark
777	GO GET 'EM
778	Marissa, Hey!
778	Just thinking about you.
778	I hope all is well out west.
778	Things here are sure interesting.
778	You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.
778	I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.
778	This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).
778	Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.
778	We should find out pretty soon.
778	I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.
778	He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.
778	It seems to be right up his ally.
778	He asked me to tell you hello.
778	Sarah and I took vacation last week.
778	I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.
778	It was fun.
778	Please write back and let me know how you are doing.
778	How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.
778	Mark
779	Do you prefer that I take out the added language for future agreements?

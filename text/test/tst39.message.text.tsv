0	Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst.
0	I had about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer between Friday and this morning.
0	Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all I know.
0	Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing happen to him last week.
0	Chris
1	How about my RRSP contributions for this year?
1	Chris
2	The tag number on this deal is N67904.2 Please address all future deal inquiries of this nature to Scott Adams or Kathy Reeves.
2	Thank you, Chris Dorland
3	Angela, I'll take the 2 tickets for Feb. 25 th vs. Phoenix Chris
4	If you find any fundamental problems with this model let me know.
5	Andrew, Nice to hear from you.
5	Hope all is well in the UK.
5	The millenium came and went and I think I had a good time.
5	I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML.
5	Good for him.
5	That is a shit business with no future.
5	The broker is the buggy whip of the financial services industry.
5	I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to visit.
5	I have to run but I'll keep in touch.
5	Take care, Chris
6	Kramer, How are things going?
6	We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip sometime in the next few months.
6	Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged.
6	No chicks.
6	Work is going great.
6	Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time.
6	Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here.
6	I am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.
6	Take it easy and w/b,
7	Kramer, Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve.
7	Lavo still trades the term in Alberta but is never around.
7	As for Benny, after an unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston to trade power.
7	No shit!
7	Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached.
7	I have an idea, like everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such.
7	I don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
7	I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the industry.
7	There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich off of it.
7	Check out enron stock (ENE).
7	We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month.
7	Not bad for a small Texas pipeline company.
7	You would need a sand blaster to get the smile off of Lavorato's face.
7	However I don't think I'm going to retire on my Enron options any time soon.
7	Gotta hop!
7	(PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt. The Jannon's would do the logo justice.)
8	Hi Andrew!
8	How are things in London?
8	I am talking to MH right now and he says you are getting a little tired of school.
8	I don't blame you one bit.
8	I need a vacation.
8	I bet you do to.
8	What do you say to a little Amsterdam trip in April?
8	I think we deserve it.
8	What do you think of MH changing companies?
8	I think he should get out of that business altogether.
8	He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.
8	Take care, Chris
9	Dianne, There doesn't seem to be a new March Aeco product set up.
9	Give me a call.
9	Chris
10	Dianne, Can you break out buys and sells separately.
10	That format would make it easier for me to transfer the info.
10	to my model.
10	Chris
11	Brad, Just thinking about my RRSP's.
11	I want to make sure I have maximized my contributions.
11	Chris
12	Mike, Good to hear you arrived safely.
12	Reno was very average.
12	Too much travel.
12	I guess you know all about that.
12	Hope that work is going well.
12	I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob.
12	Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try Robert.Benson@enron.com.
12	Let me know if those don't work.
12	Gotta hop!
12	Keep in touch, Chris
13	Brad, Could you e-mail me your mailing address so I can send off a cheque.
13	Please make sure I've maximized my foreign content as I don't love the TSE at What did you think of that Enron announcement?
13	Chris
14	Not having to add products (ie. Hub cash) to our composite pages everyday would be more convenient.
15	Mike, Hope you found a great place to live.
15	It is ridiculous how expensive flats are in London.
15	Thank god your making pounds now.
15	Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.
15	Good weather, good friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy casinos and too much time in fucking airports.
15	That about summarizes the weekend.
15	Laird is doing fine.
15	Things have been relatively slow and the market is very choppy.
15	I've been pretty quiet.
15	No major axes to grind.
15	Just trying to look for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.
15	You have to go out for Middle Eastern food.
15	Go to The Lebanese Restaurant.
15	I think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure.
15	Also try Ranoush Juice for a falafel.
15	Good luck and keep in touch!
15	Chris
16	Please don't change any deals until we have spoken.
16	I need to talk to John about how these changes will affect his positions.

21	Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 days a week.
21	So far I'm at one in a row.
21	Things are looking good for a repeat today.
21	Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office.
21	For all your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum now.
21	I think Lambie helped them out there.
21	Take care, Chris
22	Morgan, Heard through Bugg your in SF now.
22	You should rethink coming up to Kelowna for May long.
22	Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon.

22	Any good stock ideas?
22	Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board.
22	This could be a Qualcomm.
22	Gotta hop, Chris Dorland
23	Kathy, Could you find out what the breakdown between the $CND and $US monthly index positions transfer to our book were for the month of March.

34	I see an RJR Nabisco deal here.
34	Break off Miller and Kraft and let the death merchant division die slowly.
34	Chris
35	I don't care what we do.

42	Chris
43	John, Where are we at on credit with these guys.
43	They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's parental guarentee.

63	The fucking nasdaq is down 10 % today and the dow was down almost 5% at one point.
63	The TSE was down 770 to 8880 at one point.

120	I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book (I only wrote it in my red book).
120	Chris
121	Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that?
121	Chris
122	Jai Hawker I won't forget about the $.
123	Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive?
123	All the guys at work are saying I shouldn't bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one.
123	Chris
124	I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis.
124	I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say.
124	He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.
124	Chris
125	Done!
125	Expect a call from Paul tonight.
125	Chris

129	I worked until midnight last night and I am very tired.
129	We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some steaks on Saturday after golf.
129	Danny and I can leave after dinner or first thing in the morning on Sunday.
129	I hope your (and my) work week improves.
129	See you tommorow!
129	Chris
130	Why is the Analyst / Associate program excluded from the referral incentive program?
130	Chris
131	When are you coming?
132	Dianne, Do you keep a copy of the spreadsheet you send me everyday?
132	I need some days in May for a new economics model that I am building.
132	Let me know.
132	Chris
133	You owe me $10 for lunch.
133	I know where you live.
134	I sent it to him.
134	Chris
135	You might want to watch out while you're crossing the street.
136	I'm done!
136	I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading.
136	I have to set up the economics page but that shouldn't take long.
136	What about reversals from our currency book?
136	Which way do the reversals from the other books go?
136	The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.
136	I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
136	Hopefully this makes things easier on you.
136	Thanx for all your hard work!
136	Chris
137	Movie tonight?
137	Did you talk to MH?
137	Chris
138	WHAT'S UP?
138	GIVE ME A CALL.
138	I WANT TO HOOK UP WITH JILL SOMETIME.
138	READY FOR STAMPEDE?
138	ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REST.
139	Dawn, I want to allocate my $1000 of flex money to my YMCA membership.
139	I paid for the Y membership with my Visa.
139	How do I get my $1000 back?
139	Chris
140	Saturday at 2:48.
140	We might have to invite Johnny.
140	Chris
141	Can't get away on Monday.
141	See you Saturday night.
141	Chris
142	Kathy, Do we have any NX1 / NX3 risk for July?
142	Chris
143	Forest Green Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo Chris
144	I bought an MP3 player and need some songs.
144	I understand you are the man.
144	Hook me up!
144	Chris
145	Give me a call and give me directions to Andrew's cabin.
145	Chris
146	Send me your e-mail address at home.
146	I want to send you that fishing cartoon.
146	Chris
147	Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long or short.
147	My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile.
147	We need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie out.
147	If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it.
147	Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.
147	Chris
148	How goes day #1 in TO?
148	Did you get everything straightened out with the movers?
148	It is pouring rain and 9 celcius here.
148	Keep it real.
148	Chris
149	Could you teach my brother how to use his e-mail?
150	Are you guys still going to desperados (SP?) tommorow?
150	I think I'm going to head there at about 3PM with Rob Laird and Blair McDermott (you know Blair... the guy with the huge...) Chris
151	Hope work is going well.
151	Dusting off my cowboy hat and going stampeding tomorrow.
151	I'll try to give you a call tonight or on the weekend.
151	Say hi to MH and Wilson and Charlene.
151	Chris
152	What is your work phone number?
153	I don't know anything about any sunglasses.
153	Just kidding, I was wearing them all weekend.
153	Chris
154	NO
155	I'll bring them by your office this afternoon.
156	I was just kidding.
156	How desperately do you need them?
156	Tonight I will be around in the evening.
156	If you are lucky I might even buy you a cup of coffee.
157	I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday.
157	It is the Enron customer party that day.
157	As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere else after.
157	I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school nights.
157	I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday.
157	Am I going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around town?
157	I hope not.
157	Chicks dig me in those glasses.
158	Just Laird, Blair, Perry, Tony and a couple of guys around here.
158	Is that a problem?
159	You are paranoid.
160	Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they became managers.
160	It doesn't really matter.
160	I never really understood why he cared.
160	I think they look more professional with titles.
160	You should ask Jan. Chris
161	How is your wounded eye?
162	When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning beds.
162	Your sunglasses are fine.
162	I wore them while I was hangin' around the house last night.
162	My neighbors think I am a total freak.
162	Maybe it wasn't the sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all night .
162	I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius.
162	I am so bored.
162	I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good.
162	Better get back to doing NOTHING!
163	Perhaps...
164	I do not suck at writing e-mails.
164	You just can't appreciate the sense of humor one develops in my line of work.
164	It's borderline madness.
164	I should be home all night but do call first in case I'm outside working in the garden.
165	Today my head hurts.
165	I don't know where our seats at the rodeo are.
165	Yesterday they were at the north end of the infield but I have no idea where they are for tommorow.
165	A word to the wise, avoid the draft beer at the rodeo.
165	I contains rat poison.
166	How are things going?
166	Learning lots?
166	Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today.
166	I'm not doing anything today but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that should be good for a headache.
166	Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and Saturday to Nashville North with the boys.
166	Weather has been good and looks like that will continue.
166	Did you find a gym yet?
166	Chris
167	The have Mike's Hard and stuff like that.
167	I generally never go out during the week.
167	I was home by 7pm yesterday but I am an enormous baby when it comes to hangovers.
167	I'm not going to the rodeo on Friday but I am going to the chucks that night.
167	Tonight I rest.
168	That's fine.
168	I'll be home all night.
169	I was wondering why I wasn't getting any mail.
169	Could you please send me that stuff through intercompany mail.
169	I need to pay that insurance bill soon.
169	If they can't straighten it out I'll send you your mail a couple times a week through inter-company mail.
169	Peace out!
170	I thought you would like that.
170	We've been working the homeboy language in the broker market all week.
170	You diss'n me?
170	I'll bust a cap in your ass.
171	And you are moching me for peace out..
172	Go buy Independence Day on DVD.
173	How's it going?
173	Hear you are working pretty crazy hours.
173	Went to NN with the boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good weekend.
173	I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work and sleep for a few days.
173	Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.
173	Chris
174	How was your final stampede weekend?
174	I have a cold so I layed pretty low this weekend.
174	Did your friend have a good time?
175	That was not a snub.
175	I was being sneaky...
176	I can't just sit here and write e-mails all day.
176	I'm a busy man.
176	I did not mean to offend you.
176	I had smoozing to do and didn't want to neglect our customers.
177	Today I'm leaving by 5.
177	Usually by 5:30-6.
177	Et vous?
178	Dawn, How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund $ for the flexible spending account?
178	I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen anything yet.
178	The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since.
178	Chris
179	Do you have any plans for July 29th?
179	If not, would you like to come to Ryan's stag?
179	You could play golf with Darryl Brown, Ryan's dad and their friend Dave.
179	I think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards.
179	Let me know either way.
179	Chris
180	Sorry I haven't responded.
180	I left early yesterday and have been big time busy today.
180	I am still pretty sick.
180	I'll write back soon.
181	Rod, Thanx for booking those tee times.
181	I will be playing on saturday and I am going to get either Mike or Brad to join us if that is OK.
181	Chris (Are you guys golfing on Sunday? I booked a time for 11:52)
182	I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any.
182	I am having a shitting week.
182	Sick and tired.
182	I can't wait for the weekend.
182	I am going to sleep and golf.
182	Where are you going on vacation?
182	There aren't many weekends left in the summer and that sucks!
182	Out of the weekends that are left I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto.
182	I am never going to play any golf.
182	gotta hop
183	Kathy, Could you run a NX3 position report for our book please.
183	Chris
184	Jay, I can't seem to suspend my product without hitting the stop sign with the hand on it.
184	The red stop light isn't showing up and when I right click on the product the suspend product option is faded and I can't select it.
184	How can I fix this?
184	Let me know.
184	Chris Dorland
185	Tasha How are you doing?
185	Did you have a good stampede?
185	I had a great stampede but got a nasty cold.
185	Work is going good.
185	Do you know Ryan Flemming?
185	He went to Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine.
185	Anyway, he is getting married August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for his wedding.
185	Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents.
185	Did you know my brother moved to Toronto?
185	I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm staying in Kensington.
185	That is all that is new in my life.
185	We should hit a patio and have a drink one night.
185	Take it easy, Chris
186	I cannot seem to suspend my product without hitting the red hand button (not an option when I right click on the product and not red stop light).
186	Chris Dorland
187	Pancanadian Petroleum - Wayne Harvey Transcanada Gas Services - Brian Krumpka Engage Energy Canada - Toby McKenna Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce - Alan Wright (not too sure about this one)
188	Dad, What is the rule for guests on the weekend?
188	Chris
189	"Mr. Launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive research: Look for companies such as Enron and El Paso whose stocks are trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth rates."
189	The one thing that scares me about Enron is the P/E, regardless of earnings growth.
189	Our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that keeps getting faster and faster.
189	At some point you fall on your ass.
189	That being said, I have never sold a share of Enron stock or exercised an option.
189	We always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from nowhere.
189	Investment in Enron should be treated with the same caution as investing in Cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional valuation methods.
189	Chris
190	Five years out of any particular date?
191	Saturday was really fun.
191	Golf was great.
191	Mike and Andrew's group was by far the drunkest foursome.
191	Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to play pool.
191	That is when things got out of hand.
191	We got Ryan a bright yellow T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters.
191	Call me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details.
191	My head still hurts.
192	I will be able to attend Milly's party.
193	How was your holiday?
193	You missed some beautiful weather.
193	My best friend's stag was on saturday and I still feel like shit.
193	I guess I deserve it for drinking 200 beers.
193	From what I recall I had a good time though.
193	Tonight I am going to bed at 8pm.
193	I can't wait.
193	Chris
194	Dianne, Do you have our index positions for September ready yet?
194	Chris
195	When you have them ready could you give me the reversals for this month please.
195	Chris
196	What questions?
196	I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't remember any questions.
196	I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty funny.
196	The sports ones were pretty good.
196	The others were pretty tasteless, so they were my favorites.
196	I feel much better today.
196	I'm already getting psyched up for the weekend.
196	I am going to play golf and not drink.
196	I hate alcohol.
196	I am on the wagon.
196	For good this time.
196	At least for a week anyway.
196	Chris
197	Enron Corp. up 1 5/8
198	The stag was a total monkey show.
198	We played golf and pool, ate some dinner, took in the ballet and the hit the bars.
198	I did manage to get a couple of rounds of golf in between all the drinking.
198	I actually played pretty good.
198	Houseboating sounds like fun.
198	I've never done that.
198	I am so on the wagon.
198	I can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend.
198	Lots of golf.
199	Jay, I can't seem to add any new products to my customer page.
199	Mike Cowan said to drop you a line and have you clear the pages.
199	Chris Dorland
200	Chris
201	I don't suspose you are working on the beautiful holiday monday but I just thought I would say hi.
201	I am so bored!
201	As soon as the Nymex settles I am getting out of here.
201	Chris
202	I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing.
202	That sucks.
202	It is so nice outside.
202	Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later.
202	Probably not.
202	I am such a lazy piece of shit lately.
202	I am definately going to go running now.
202	Self depreciation has motivated me.
202	I need to buy some rollerblades.
202	Where did you get yours?
202	Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively inexpensive.
202	Any thoughts?
202	Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this afternoon.
202	You should be proud of me.
202	I was able to stay out of the bottle all weekend.
202	Quite an accomplishment don't you think.
202	One hour to go.
202	Someone shoot me!
202	Chris
203	Kelly, I got you address from an e-mail from Meg and thought I would say hi.
203	How is work going?
203	Still in boston?
203	I'm still plugging away at ENE.
203	Buy the stock.
203	It's the next CSCO.
203	Gotta hop!
203	Chris
204	I want to go see the klumps.
204	How is tonight?
204	I don't go to movies on tuesdays.
204	You are going out wednesday and I leave for Ft.
204	Mac on thursday.
205	Have you ever been to a movie on a Tuesday?
205	I can afford the extra $4 to sit in a theater that isn't totally packed with 14 year old kids.
205	The Klumps starts at 7:15 at Eau Claire.
205	How does that sound?
205	My friend's wedding is in Ft.
205	Mac.
205	That is why I'm going there on thursday.
206	I only like the movies that all the 14 year old kids like.
207	I don't have my drivers license yet.
207	I start driver's training next week.
208	That was very nice.
208	Where do you get this stuff?
208	Chris
209	What is your hotmail nickname?
210	Got some great news today!
210	I'll call you tonight.
211	I got rewarded for hard work.
212	No I'm sure it was well within the boundaries of our tolerance policy.
213	Meg, Can't wait for the cabin party.
213	Taking my lampshade to the cleaners after work.
213	Chris
214	Happy belated B-Day!
214	How was the party?
214	I am so tired today.
214	Too much driving.
214	I think I set a land speed from Ft.
214	Mac to Calgary yesterday.
214	Chris
215	The wedding was great!
215	Too much fun.
215	Once again I'm hung over on a monday.
215	No great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle.
215	I tripped on a cord to a video camera.
215	Mildly embarrassing.
215	My friend was a rock.
215	I think I was more nervous than him.
215	Ft.
215	Mac is a total shit hole.
215	On my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft. MacMurray, once."
215	No Houston for me.
215	Thank god.
215	I have to go to a party at my boss's on Saturday.
215	I think I might try to play golf as well.
215	I will be taking it very easy.
215	No more booze.
215	My liver hurts.
215	Chris
216	Below is the error message Chris gets when logging in to EOL.
216	If we hit Yes it keeps coming back with the same error.
216	(Sometimes it works though... you figure it out).
216	If you hit No, the browser session freezes up.
216	We have done the following: Uninstalled/Reinstalled Shockwave Reinstalled browser Please look at this ASAP since he needs to be able to see the customer screen.
216	Thanks, Attila
217	No golf for me at 10:00am.
218	Gina, Ryan Watt runs our model for us now so I don't need this spreadsheet everyday.
218	Chris
219	I was sent a password but have missplaced it.
219	Could you e-mail me a password please.
219	Thank you, Chris Dorland Enron Canada Corp.
220	Opened my Ivey Alumninet package after about a year in my in box and thought I would try it out.
220	If this gets to you w/b.
220	Chris Dorland
221	Ryan Testing the Ivey e-mail forwarding system.
221	If you get this w/b.
221	Chris Dorland
222	Sorry, it has been a gong show around here.
222	I'll write back soon.
222	Chris
223	Meg, Jill is having a birthday barbeque at her house August 27.
223	She wanted me to let you know.
223	Chris
224	I told her about it but I don't think she can make it.
224	She called me when she was in Calgary yesterday.
224	Call me when you get home.
224	Chris
225	Are you working this fine Sunday.
225	I am.
225	It has been crazy around here.
225	Mike has been out so I've been going 90 mph with my hair on fire.
225	This week should be better.
225	I still haven't bought any rollerblades.
225	I've been playing lots of squash.
225	How was your week?
225	Gotta watch Tiger now.
225	Chris
226	We should grab some sushi and talk.
226	Call me at work.
226	Chris
227	I was not hung over yesterday.
227	I had 3 beers and went home.
227	How about that for self control?
227	I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday night and did some laundry.
227	What a loser I am.
227	I am going to Sylvan this weekend.
227	My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her going away party.
227	Meg's cabin parties are generally epic gong shows.
227	I need to rest up this week.
227	I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday.
227	Now if I get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants.
227	I don't think you need to take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week.
227	Can't you do it yourself?
227	I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept person in the world.
227	Chris
228	Tricia, I want to exercise some Enron stock options but don't know who I should call.
228	Do you have a name and/or phone number of someone?
228	I also don't know what information I need to have in order to exercise.
228	Could you give me a call (x6910) and help me out.
228	Chris Dorland
229	I would like to golf both days this weekend.
229	Do we have times?
229	Let me know I can try to book some if Rod hasn't.
230	I talked to Rod he got me a time at 1:21 for Saturday.
230	I'll play with my buddies on Saturday.
230	I would like to play with you and mom in Sunday.
230	I'll book a tee time if that is OK.
230	Chris
231	Looks like what I thought was happening is happening.
231	Give me a call.
231	Chris
232	I'll be home Friday at 6pm.
232	Dinner sounds great.
232	Chris
233	Writing to confirm your receipt of my account information forms sent by fax.
233	I wanted to make sure you had all the information you needed to set up the account.
233	Please call me at 403-974-6910 when you have the account number.
233	Thank you, Chris Dorland Enron
234	I got a tee time for 12:24 on Sunday.
234	Chris
235	Where do you get this stuff?
235	Sorry I haven't written back but my world is being turned upside down.
235	It is amazing how much your life can change in a day.
235	more to follow...
236	It doesn't really matter if you don't like the new Janet song.
236	I'm so funny.
236	My life is being turned upside down by work but I can't be much more specific than that.
237	Dad, When are you buying mom a new Jeep?
237	I need to sell my truck and do it fast.
237	I was thinking I could trade it in towards mom's new one and that might be the best way to get at least decent money for it.
237	Just a thought.
237	Chris
238	I'm not on either.
238	It is good upside down.
238	I am crazy busy.
238	Did you get the "Doesn't really matter.."
238	bit.
238	I am so funny.
239	It is a 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo, 55 000 km's, V8 loaded.
239	I think it is worth about $25 Grand.
239	Chris
240	In response to this e-mail.
240	The guy who had the party is Rob Milnthorp.
240	He is the Pres.
240	and CEO of Enron Canada.
240	John Disturnall is our option trader.
240	Jon Mckay runs Canadian trading and is my immediate boss.
240	I must have missed this one.
241	John, I am planning to come to Houston Wednesday and Thursday to sit with the East desk.
241	Unless that is going to create problems, would you mind letting them know that I'm coming.
241	Chris
242	Brad, I don't know if you've heard but I am moving to Houston at the end of September.
242	I need to know how much I have contributed to my RRSP through you this year so I can maximize my annual contributions before I go.
242	Can you figure this out and let me know.
242	Chris
243	I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a vehicle from a dealer).
243	The following were the values it came up with for a Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).
243	Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND) Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND) The retail number seems way too high.
243	I think something like $23 000 to $25000 would be fair.
243	Let me know what you think.
243	Chris
244	Are you coming over on Saturday night?
244	We can talk then.
244	Chris
245	How's it going.
245	I've been in Houston all week.
245	When are you going houseboating?
245	Must be soon.
245	I'll write more later.
245	Chris
246	Tricia, I am moving to our Houston office and have some questions regarding my RRSP and Pension with Clarica.
246	Can you give me a call when you have a minute on Tuesday afternoon (after 1pm when trading is done) and I will come by and see you.
246	Chris
247	Brad, I have contributed $3000 this year to my RRSP through you and $3300 through Enron.
247	What is my maximum contribution for 2000 $13500?
247	Is 3pm a good time for me to call you?
247	If not, when is?
247	Chris
248	What do I have with you in non-registered accounts?
248	Chris
249	Ryan, Good to hear things are going well.
249	I am still with Enron but I am in the process of moving to Houston.
249	I'm going down there to trade electricity so that should be interesting change from nat gas.
249	No wife.
249	No house.
249	No liver.
249	That's about it.
249	Hope India was a good time.
249	Keep in touch!
249	Chris (ps Any idea where Nav is?)
250	It has to be more than that.
250	I had a $500/month PAC set up that I just cancelled in April.
251	I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun.
251	Was the weather good?
251	Houston was hot.
251	Very hot.
251	I better get used to it though because I'm moving there.
251	That is why I have been so crazy lately.
251	I am going down there to trade power in the North East.
251	Pretty crazy shit.
251	I gotta hop but I'll write more later.
251	Chris
252	Brad, I'm on dope.
252	I was looking at the wrong bank statement.
252	The $700 number sounds correct.
252	Can you sell that stuff for me please.
252	I'll give you a cheque this weekend to top up my RRSP.
252	Chris
253	How are you doing?
253	What are you doing?
253	I am still working for Enron.
253	I have been trading nat gas for about 3 years.
253	I am moving to Houston at the end of the month.
253	In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US.
253	Should be interesting.
253	Crazy volatility.
253	I will probably have a heart attack at 26 but that's life.
253	Hope things are going well for you.
253	Chris Dorland
254	Thanx for Nav's address.
254	Congrats on the CFA.
254	Cowan just finished level 2.
254	I don't think I'm going to take it after watching the hell he went through.
254	Chris
255	My pension and group RRSP is with Clarica.
255	Can I transfer those assets to you?
255	Chris
256	I finally found Nav.
256	I am moving to Houston to trade power in the Northeastern US.
256	Gotta hop, Chris
257	What do I have to give you in order to transfer this stuff?
258	I am leaving in a 2-3 weeks.
258	Pretty much as soon as I can get all my shit together.
258	Nice timing on my part.
258	No winter for Chris.
258	I'll think of you in the snow when I'm on the golf course.
259	I will be moving to Houston by the end of the month.
259	I am actually going to be trading electricity so that should be an interesting change from nat gas.
259	We will have to hook up once I get settled.
259	How much longer are you going to be in Boston?
259	How far is Dallas from Houston?
259	Keep in touch!
259	Chris
260	Kevin, October 2 sounds fine.
260	I am going to try to be there earlier than that but I am sure I will be in and out of the office taking care of bullshit.
260	Will the package they are sending include info.
260	on movers?
260	I want to book them as soon as possible.
261	Got my number from Lavo today.
261	$80k USD / year and a promo in Feb. See you Saturday.
261	Chris
262	What do you need from me to transfer my RRSP and Penson.
262	I want to take care of it weekend.
262	Chris
263	I am wondering if you know which moving company Enron uses to move people to Houston.
263	Despite the fact that I haven't seen the formal offer I think I should book a mover so I don't get stuck.
263	Let me know if you know or if there is someone in Houston I should talk to (Jennifer?).
263	Chris
264	Dawn got my apartment # wrong in her e-mail.

268	Did you contact Clarica?
268	Do I need to do anything?
268	Chris
269	Brad The lady in our HR department told me Charlotte is out on maternity leave.
269	Do you want me to find out who else we can call?
269	Chris
270	Brad Could you cancel my PAC plan after the September contribution.
270	I have thought more about the leverage idea you suggested and want to talk to you.
270	Can I give you a call later this afternoon?
270	What time are you going to be in the office until?
270	What is you home phone number.
270	I will be at the office late tonight working on move shit.

272	Talk to you later.
272	Chris
273	I do have one running for my RRSP account.
273	$500 per month.
273	I was wrong about my unregistered account.
273	Chris
274	Margaret, I have completed all of the information and am awaiting my University transcripts.
274	The copy in my HR file is missing and I have ordered some but this may take 2-3 days.
274	Should I send the other info.
274	and forward the transcripts when I receive them or wait and send it all together?
274	Let me know, Chris
275	Things are crazy.
275	I still don't have a moving date or work visa but every one assures me I have lots of time.
275	I would go to a store like future shop or look on the internet at chapters.ca.
275	All electronics / stereo shops have them now.
275	Make sure you get one with lots of memory.
275	Take it easy.
275	Chris
276	Dad, I booked a tee time for Saturday at 1:44pm.
276	Chris
277	Kim, I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight.
277	Do you know the name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation services?
277	She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name.
277	I am wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers.
277	In regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info.
277	that Margaret needs with the exception of University transcripts.
277	I had to order those and probably won't get them untill early next week.
277	Thank you for all your help!
277	Chris
278	Carol, What document are you referring to in this e-mail?
278	I have received so much stuff lately I don't know what I have and what I don't have.

279	I will fax copies of my diploma and transcripts as soon as I recieve them.
279	Chris
280	Carla, Just wanted to confirm that you sent the package I left on your desk.

280	Chris
281	What is this stuff?
281	Chris
282	Mine has 32 MB.
282	You need way more that that.
282	You can buy memory cards for most players.
282	Check out Chris
283	When you download MP3 files you should download them in 128 kps format.
283	That is CD quality sound and you can get about 30 minutes of music on 32MB of memory on an MP3 player.
283	You can sort by that format on Napster.
283	Chris
284	Kim, I sent all of my Visa application information to Margaret by FedEx today.
284	Just thought I would keep you in the loop!
284	Chris
285	I am starting to wade through it.
285	The US health care system is very different from the Canadian but the Enron coverage seems quite comprehensive.
285	Chris
286	Margaret, Just wanted to make sure you got the info.
286	I sent on Thursday.
286	How is the visa coming?
286	Let me know.
286	Chris Dorland

290	Chris
291	Ricardo, I will be joining the East power desk at the beginning of October and I am trying to get up to speed on the PJM market.
291	Kevin Prestor thought you would be able to help me find some data.
291	I am looking for the following historics in excel format (send as much data as you have and feel free to include anything else that you think might be relevant): - HDD's and CDD's for Philedelphia, Allentown Washington DC, Baltimore, Pittsburg, Newark, New York City, Cinncinati and any other cities that are relevant ?
291	- Supply outage data for PJM - Daily Import / Exprot data for PJM - Historic daily nat gas prices Transco Zone 6 ( NY and Non-NY), Chicago, ...
291	Again, please feel free to make any suggestions.
291	I am very new to the world of power and it is likely that I have overlooked something very obvious.
291	Chris Dorland
292	How's it going?
292	Did you have a good time in Victoria?
292	I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to get ready to move.
292	Went to Red Deer this weekend and played a little golf.
292	Pretty relaxing.
292	I have so much shit to do.
292	I better hop.
292	Chris
293	I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork for him.
293	Chris
294	Margaret, Just wondering how my Visa was coming along?
294	I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning.
294	The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country.
294	She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada.
294	Can you shed some light on this?
294	Chris Dorland
295	Margaret, Could you send the Visa documents to my office: Enron Canada Corp. Calgary, AB T2P 4H2 Chris Dorland
296	Everything seems OK.
296	Hopefully I will hear from the mover's this afternoon.
296	Chris
297	Margaret, I was wondering if you sent my visa documents yesterday or today.
297	I will be out of the office this afternoon but I would come back if my visa documents are going to me here.
297	Chris
298	Thank you!
299	Margaret, Please send them to the Calgary office to my attention: Enron Canada Corp. Calgary, AB Thank you, Chris Dorland

301	Supply (Generation) - Any information you have on generation in PJM (by plant) including: - Fuel type - Capacity (typical production vs. maximum production) - Efficiency (heat rates) / Marginal production costs - Historic outages - Forecast Outages - Who owns / operates the facilities?

301	Chris Dorland

371	Chris (PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is this correct?)
372	POWER IS JUST AS CRAZY I HAVE TO GO PUT ON MY RAINBOW WIG AND RED SHOES AND GET BACK TO THE CLOWN SHOW!

387	Just a little something to brighten up your weekend!
388	I'm glad you had a good time.
388	I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.
389	Did you get her address?
390	That guy has a huge pussy!
391	I think that you should make her something.
391	Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache.
391	I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).
391	Later skater...
392	Rod, What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks?
392	Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap.
392	I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive.
392	Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.
392	Chris
393	Did you send Amanda a card?
394	Hey, What's up?
394	Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans.

404	Later...
404	Chris

411	Any interest in playing golf Sunday with Ryan, my Dad and I ?

412	I was thinking around noon Saturday and around 4pm on Sunday (Ryan can't make it untill then).
412	Chris
413	I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work.
413	If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North).
413	I'll let you know.
413	If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back.
413	Let me know...
413	Chris
414	I replied to this message earlier that I would like to move to the Enron Center garage but have not received a reply.
414	Can I just go to the parking desk on level 3 and change my 1600 Smith card?
414	Chris Dorland
415	Do I just come down and change my card ?
415	Chris Dorland
416	Isn't it June 17.
416	I got him a card but not a present yet.
416	I got the card when I was home and put both our names on it.
416	What do you want to do about a gift?
417	Good idea.
417	I'll e-mail Rod and see if he has any other suggestions.
417	Chris
418	I would e-mail rod but fucking outlook lost my address book.
418	Do you have his e-mail.
419	Pls migrate and notify of any help needed.
419	Daniel (281-541-6203)

420	Any suggestions?
420	Be sure let Christina know I hope that she is feeling better.
420	Chris
421	You are in charge.
421	I think some DVD's is a super plan.
421	I was also thinking that a really nice hammock would be a great gift but I have no idea where to get one.
421	I will talk to mom and see if she knows where we could get one.
421	Chris
422	No problem.
423	John, Rob and I are both in for golf on Sunday.
423	Chris
424	You can send it at any time during the day.
424	Chris Dorland
425	What's up?
425	I nearly drowned on the way home the other day.
425	Beautiful weather we're having.
425	Are you feeling better?
425	I got a cold but I feel better today.
425	The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night.
425	Tonight is the MTV movie awards.
425	I really need to get a life.
425	I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene.
425	I'll let you know if they are coming tommorow.
425	Talk to you later.
425	Chris
426	I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing.
426	My car is on the 4th floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine.
426	I love the MTV movie awards.
426	Shannon Elizabeth rules.
426	Halle Berry naked in Swordfish.
426	Can't wait.
426	What's new with you?
427	I had to put the cougar to sleep.
427	Too annoying for words.
427	What happened to the hot from the picture?
428	I'll be there for the wedding.
428	No stag for me though.
429	No chance of me getting back on the cougar trail.
429	I have devoted myself to scouting out dumb blondes under the age of 25.
429	Ideally I will find some 22 year old Britney Spears look alike.
429	Wish me well.
429	Chris
430	I'll keep those suggestions on file.
430	I got him a pretty cool hammock from this Sharper Image type place.
430	Hopefully it will help him relax a little.
430	Chris
431	Have you made a packing list yet?
431	I would have.
431	Getting excited I bet.

435	Jackie, I'm glad you made it through another Dancentral production.
435	All is going well hear.
435	Work is very busy.
435	I didn't know that Andrea was expecting again.
435	Be sure to send my congrats and best wishes.
435	I hope Mark is feeling better.
435	He is too yound to be so stress.
435	Sounds like your new house is beautiful.

435	Better get back to work.
435	Great to hear from you and please send my best to everyone.
435	Chris
436	Matt, Looking forward to the wedding.

436	Take care and be sure to say hi to Jen.
436	Chris
437	This has something to do with my cell bill.
437	Can you make sure it got paid.
437	Chris
438	My mailing address.
438	Houston, Texas
439	I like number 6.
439	I should put a sign on my desk that says that.
440	I got 4.
441	Apparently GS is going to issue a report saying ENE is worth $68 a share.
441	Chris
442	Keith just told me that Mckay is moving down here.
442	I guess it is out now.
442	Did you talk to John Z?
442	Chris
443	John What is the plan for Thursday night?
443	Chris
444	Great story.

447	John Give me a call when you've got a minute and I'll bring you $ for the tickets.
447	Chris
448	I am dead tired.
448	We had a group offsite this weekend and it was a gong show.
448	I haven't had a chance to talk to JL yet but I am going to try to catch him this afternoon.
448	Chris
449	I talked to JL yesterday.
449	He didn't exactly embrace the idea.
449	Told me to let him think about it.
449	I'll let you know if I hear anything else.

451	Take it easy Chris
452	Crystal, How was your trip?
452	I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat.
452	We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better destination.
452	Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the humidity.
452	Can't wait.
452	Take it easy.
452	Chris
453	Crystal Sorry it took so long to get back to you.
453	My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs.
453	Lots of fun.
453	I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation.
453	Are you over your cold yet?
453	It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July.
453	I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th.
453	I watched the NY fireworks on TV.
453	We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest.
453	Better get back but I'll write back later.
453	Chris

472	See you in a couple of weeks.
472	Chris
473	Nov-Mar Sumas has moved about 0.20 since I started watching it.

473	Chris
474	I think a mid sept tee time will work.
474	I want to try to be there for the off site with the west guys.

477	Rack up another half million for me today.
477	Fuck!
478	The range on my next day power was 110 to 260.
479	Not good.
479	Listen to this.
479	At the end of the day dailies traded down to 85 bucks.
479	Check that range 85-275.
479	I need a vacation.
480	I want stag details.

481	Just in time for ski season.
481	Later Chris
482	I really want to live in Altadore.
482	I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang.
482	I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ?
482	Close to downtown.
482	I am thinking infill / townhouse.
482	My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore.
482	I am thinking of checking those out.
482	I am looking for minimal maintenance.
482	Do you have any ideas?
482	Seen Kerri Murray lately?
482	CD
483	Lee Clarke...
483	Sounds like a fag.
483	Garrison woods that is the place my mom was talking about.
483	Do you live near there?
484	Done.
484	I'm moving in!
484	Can I borrow your lawn mower?
484	I need to decide what I am going to do with my ride.
484	I think I am going to bring it with me and buy a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires.
484	Don't you have a tire guy?
485	I already have a minature goat.
485	I am a little concerned about making a housing decision in one day but what the fuck.
486	I looked at the MLS listings and there is some stuff on there.
486	I have a realtor who seems to have her act together.
486	Don't worry about it.
486	How long would it take me to get to work from there?
487	3 songs.
487	I can deal with that.
488	Now that I have a place to live all I need is a chica.
488	I am going to a wedding in Red Deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available young ladies there.
488	How is Mike McD?
488	Are you married yet?
488	Any kids on the way?
489	Thanx.
489	I haven't done a trade in over an hour.
490	I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work.
490	A little old for my taste as well.
490	She is hot though.
490	She looks exactly like Mariah Carey.
490	It is great hanging out with her.
490	It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties.
490	Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town.
491	So much for being bullish.
492	Congrats on the CFA.
492	I am actually fighting back today.
492	How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work?
492	I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours.
492	Let me know what you think.
492	I am going to have to get Monica back.
493	Congrats on the CFA!
493	Maybe one day I'll get off my lazy ass and give it a shot.
493	Chris
494	Linda, I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell.
494	The following properties are the type of place I have in mind.
494	I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for.
494	I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo.
494	I look forward to meeting you on Friday.
494	Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary.
494	Chris Dorland Cell 713-416-6694 Red Deer home 403-343-7086 I have also heard a lot of good things about Garrison Woods and would like to check that development out.
495	Mikey, I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo.
495	I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area.
495	I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst.
495	A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods.
495	Have you heard of it?
495	What is the plan for the weekend.
495	You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands.
495	Maybe we could track down Johnny after.
495	Are you taking a chica to the wedding?
495	I am so looking forward to coming home.
495	I got my face ripped off last week.
495	Talk to you later...
495	Chris
496	Things are look up on the Sept/Oct.
496	Spread I think I am going to add to my position.
496	Cash going out week.
496	Chris
497	Hopefully I will be able to make it by then.
497	I have to talk to Fletch and Presto but it makes sense for me to be there by then.
497	I am coming to town on Thursday.
497	I'll probably drop by the office on Friday.
497	Chris
498	I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300.
498	If not could you recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find something that would work.
498	Thanx for your time.
498	Chris Dorland
499	Tamara, Thanx for the info.
499	I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like?
499	Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example.
499	Also I will need to have my car winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give you a call then.
499	Chris Dorland
500	Thank you.
500	Chris Dorland Houston, TX
501	Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the middle of September.
501	Spending Friday house shopping.
501	I think I am going to end up in your neck of the woods.
501	Seems like the best values are in that area.
501	Are we going to get some snow this winter?
501	We need to find Dorland a date.
501	I am going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single chicas there.
501	I am really looking forward to being back in Cow town.
501	Houston is painfull.
501	Later
502	Fuck you.
502	That's how we spell it in Belgium.
503	I was confused by your use of 2 spellings.
503	Did you like my Austin Power's reference?
503	"I know. That's how we do it in Belgium. It's called a Belgium dip" You are back in my good graces.
503	Try not to confuse the dumb fat kid.
504	Have you guys moved over to the wonderful world of boxes with Enron Canada yet?
505	If you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of Dunlop Winter Sport M2 tires.
505	Is you tire guy also a wheel guy?
505	I need some winter wheels as well.
506	Lexus IS 300.
506	Not sure if I am going to buy 17" or 16" wheels for the winter.
506	Jackass.
507	I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle.
507	I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter.
508	For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work.
508	It's all about the $$$.
508	Work hard and retire early.
508	Cheers Chris P.S.
508	I am moving back to Calgary in about a month.
508	Enron continues to feel free to move me around at will.
508	I am actually really looking forward to it.
509	Glad to hear all is well.
509	I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses.
509	It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work.
509	It is all about the $$$.
509	Work hard.
509	Make $$$.
509	Retire young.
509	Things with me are great.
509	Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go.
509	Take care.
510	I just heard from a mutual friend that Kerrie Murray got engaged recently.
510	Scratch that one off the list of possibles.
511	Jill, Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy.
511	What is with people (that article) ?
511	Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours.
511	I am pushing for a 4 day work week.
511	Why Calgary?
511	Why not?
511	I love Calgary.
511	Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career.
511	This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole.
511	I think it is a promotion.
511	Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world.
511	This city has few redeeming features.
511	What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty.
511	Actually, it isn't that bad.
511	Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary.
511	In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can.
511	Kerrie got engaged.
511	Good for her.
511	I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention.
511	I am not engaged.
511	I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela.
511	No big loss.
511	Too old for me anyway (31).
511	Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY.
511	I am going to have to visit some time.
511	I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination.
511	Or is NY home for a while?
511	No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend.
511	Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary.
511	Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday.
511	My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring.
511	Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.
511	My family is doing great.
511	My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff.
511	Dancing and buying shit for their house.
511	Both of their health is great.
511	My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.
511	How is Meg doing?
511	Is she in Australia now?
511	I should get in touch with her.
511	I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night.
511	Good for her.
511	I hope all goes well for her.
511	Dan did go to D's wedding.
511	Said it was really nice.
511	Still don't get that one?
511	I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt.
511	Keep in touch.
511	Chris (this e-mail is record length for me)
512	Phil is marrying that chick huh.
512	She is pretty hot from what I recall.
512	I am definately into doing something on Sunday.

517	Kim, I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go.

532	Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept. 7 ?

535	I am coming back in mid-september.
535	Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back?

537	Chris
538	Dawn, I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today.
538	I wasn't sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent.
538	The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement (3.4) and termination before end of term (2.1).
538	If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter.
538	Let me know what you want me to do.

542	Kim, Any word on what happens to my 401k and/or savings plan when I transfer back to Calgary?
542	Let me know.
542	Chris
543	Tricia, I think I gave you the wrong fax number for Terri O'Laughlin at the Royal Bank.

543	Chris
544	Thanx Laura.
544	I need to change about 125-150k USD is that OK.
544	Chris

565	Sounds nice.
565	Is there somewhere on the web I can see it.

568	Benson and I own some wood.
568	Chris

570	I am selling mine cheap before I move.
571	Do you guys have a good map of Alberta and BC that includes Alliance.
571	If so please send it to me.
571	Chris
572	Carmax showed me a $29000 bid.
572	I'll sell it to you for $29500.
573	On the base model.
573	Mine has 6K in options.
573	It is totally loaded.
573	Silver/Black with 3800 miles.
574	No tax either.
575	Mine has leather, limited slip differential and special window tinting that reflects heat.
575	Plus no tax.
576	And half the miles this one has.
577	She should beaten in the streets.
578	Silver with Black interior.
579	I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary.
579	Let me know if you want to see it.
579	I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.
580	Great.
580	I will call you on Sept. 6th when I get to town.
580	Chris
581	Martin, I left early yesterday.
581	Does tonight work for you?
581	No spoiler and the car was high and dry during Allison.
581	Chris
582	After the pain in the ass selling my current car is giving me I am thinking about leasing.
582	Can you work up some lease rates for 24 and 36 months.
582	Chris
583	MTV music awards Thursday September 6th - Hopefully we get another Britney strip tease this year.
584	Listen to this shit.
584	If I want to move my car back to Canada I (Enron) would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in import duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits.
584	Looks like I am looking for a new car as well.
585	We were talking about getting matching PT cruisers with CRUISR1 and CRUISR2 personalized plates.
586	Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights.
586	Chicks are going to love it.
586	I'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims.
586	SWEET!
586	The funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that would be a killer ride.
587	Lady with python on one side , Star wars on the other...
588	When I am back in Calgary your whole desk is going to have listen to this shit all day over the box...
589	I am going to go home an watch the Austin Power's movies over and over tonight...
590	What does the Kergan think of his Jeep?
590	I think I am going to get one of those.
590	Unless you have forgotten the Kergan's where an acient people from the steps of Russia who , for entertainment, tossed children in pits with wild dogs to fight for food.
591	What doesn't he like about it?
592	John, Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be: Movers - $7500 CND Flight - $1500 CND October Rent - $1500 CND I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.
592	Chris
593	I'm not very excited to hang out with Mikey all the time.
593	See what Johnny is up to and hit the Benson and Hedges menthol's.
594	Tricia, I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs.
594	My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.
594	Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND Duty on this amount = 3300 GST on this amount = 3800 Excise tax = 180 Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx.
594	500 That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000).
594	Total approximately $10000 CND.
594	Hardly seems like the best option.
594	Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year.
594	And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD.
594	Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be: Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD) Flight = $1500 CND Hotel = $1500 CND October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October) The total of the above is $11 800.
595	No luck getting your lease calculator to work?
595	Actually, don't worry about it I have change my mind back to buying.
596	Do you have a number for MSN customer service?
596	I want to cancel my MSN account but have no idea how to get in touch with them.
596	Chris
597	What if any changes were made to the Grand Cherokee Limited for 2002?
598	That is great.
598	We were just having a discussion about going to other floors to take a shit because our bathroom is such a dump.
599	I think I'm going to buy a Grand Cherokee Limited instead of the X5 and save myself 30K.
599	Are we on with Johnny next week?
600	I am going to Banff for an off site.
600	I will be back in town the following Friday and we'll do it up that night.
600	Late night Johnny is OK.
600	We'll take it easy as it is a school night.
601	Glad you like the place.
601	Missed the PS on the first message.
602	I sold my car.
602	$28000 USD but Enron is going to pay me $3000 USD for not having to move it and get it licensed in Canada.
602	So it cost me $5000 to drive that car for a year.
602	Not bad I guess.
602	Have you and mom had any problems with her jeep?
602	Chris
603	My one year closed interest rate on my mortgage is 5.2%.
603	Not bad!
604	Kim, Any luck getting this info.
604	for me?
604	Chris
605	When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears.
605	Keep your eyes open.
605	2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary.
605	I can't wait.
605	Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here.
605	I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's.
605	Black I think.
605	What's new?
605	I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary.
605	I am really excited to move into my new place.
605	It is going to be sweet.
605	I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow.
605	Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes?
605	Talk to you soon.
605	Chris
606	Kim, I am sitting on the West desk on 32.
606	Chris
607	Next to Keith Holst if that helps.
607	Chris
608	This didn't work for some reason.
608	Can you try to send it again and just copy and paste all the values.
608	Chris
609	I just want to print this off.
610	Russell, Can you e-mail me the "model" spread sheet.
610	I want the eol technology.
610	Chris
611	Kim, Got the envelope yesterday.
611	Thank you very much.
611	Chris
612	Anna, I am moving back to Canada to trade gas but I would really like to get your daily technical sheet.
612	Could you e-mail it to me or perhaps start posting it on the commodity fundy's site?
612	Thanx Chris
613	So much for keeping it quiet.
613	Dorland the loudmouth is back in town.
614	Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car.
614	Chris
615	Judi, Did you receive a quote for Williams yet?
615	When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move.
615	Chris
616	Thanx looks good.
616	What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.
616	Can you put these graphs together for me.
616	Sumas vs. Rockies Sumas vs. San Juan Sumas vs. Rockies Sumas vs. San Juan Chris 713-853-1663
617	Kim, I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule.
617	I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends.
617	If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday.
617	Let me know when you would like to get together.
617	I am sitting at 3208b.
617	Chris
618	How is that ops package coming?
619	Carlos Thanx for the pos report.
619	Would you mind sending it to me each morning?
619	Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week.
619	I talked to Brian?
619	and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
619	Chris
620	A couple of other quick things.
620	My October Sumas position doesn't look correct.
620	I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d.
620	I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me.
620	Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail.
620	Chris
621	Oct Sumas trades I also bought 15000 mm/d from Chad today on EOL.
621	Chris
622	Getting closer.
622	I want a graph of the spread not of the 2 fixed prices.
622	Chris
623	Kim, I will be on 32 all morning.
623	Come down whenever you get a minute.
623	Chris
624	When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points.
624	i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65.
624	Sorry if I wasn't clear.
624	Call me with any ?s.
624	Chris
625	I didn't get yesterday's ops package.
625	Can you make sure I get it today.
625	Chris
626	Carlos, Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14).
626	I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.
626	Chris
627	No luck graphing those spreads?
627	Chris
628	Kim, I will be on 32 all day.
628	Give me a call or stop by.
628	Chris
629	Forget that last message.
629	Apparently my e-mail just updated.
629	Chris
630	I would like an indoor stall in Ernst and Young.
630	Non-reserved.
630	Chris
631	Glad to hear that everything is OK.
631	I will give you a call in a couple of days when things settle down.
631	Hopefully air traffic will resume soon because I am stuck living in the Hyatt in Houston.
631	Chris
632	Wayne, I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland.
632	I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back.
632	Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.
632	Chris Dorland
633	Carlos, If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it.
633	I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday.
633	Chris
634	Dwayne, As you can Imagine things in the US have been a little crazy which is why I haven't gotten back to you untill now.
634	I will hopefully be in Calgary on Monday and will give you a call then.
634	My office number in Calgary is 974-6910.
634	Are the windows on that truck tinted?
635	How about 2002's?
635	I was just thinking there would be incentives on 2001's.
635	Chris
636	Kim I briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit A (US salary but in CND dollars) which is incorrect.
636	As I will be in Calgary in Monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to Dawn.
636	Chris
637	Carlos These are the trades I did today.
637	Sold 5000 Oct Rocks (0.485) EOL and Cowan is working an order to buy 20000 mm/d of Oct Aeco basis vs. DI in us/mm at (0.54) Chris
638	That's fine.
638	Thanx for trying.
638	Chris
639	Willis, Can you do me a favor and get my name taken off the Brad Galante e-mail list for plant outages?
639	Chris
640	Hopefully I can get there sometime before the snow falls.
640	Chris
641	One more trade.
641	Sold 1000 gj/d Aeco DI c/gj to Cowan at 3.175 (EOL) Just to balance.
642	Chris
643	In the flesh.
644	Chris, Could you please give me access to the west desk info.

656	Chris
657	Brad, Any progress on the direct line with the west desk?
657	If we need to use a different circuit or something let me know.
657	I called Mike Grigsby and asked him to look into it on his end.
657	It is important that we get this line working as soon as possible.
657	Chris
658	Tricia, I have completed all the forms you need.
658	Let me know when you have a minute and I will drop them off.
658	Chris

667	Vicki I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May.
667	I never received the check and am wondering what to do next?
667	The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago.
667	I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have.
667	Please contact me if you need any further info.
667	or with any questions.
667	Thank you, Chris Dorland
668	If one year ago you bought $1000 worth of Nortel today it would be worth $50.

672	Did you get a chance to drop of my keys at the rental office?
672	Chris
673	Stalker, I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke's aquisition of Westcoast.
673	I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization.
673	Let me know when you have got a minute.

686	Let's get together this week and talk about our winter forecast for the X. I was thinking thursday afternoon around 2:30.
686	I'll touch base with Holst and see if the west guys can join us via conference call.
686	Let me know if that works for you.
687	Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone.
687	I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting.
687	Let me know if you have any questions.
687	Chris

690	Thank you.
691	I am not that familiar with the corporate finance side of the business but I will ask around as to who would be a good person for you to contact.
691	You might want to start with Kyle Kitagawa who is a VP in our Calgary corporate finance group.
691	You can reach him at kyle.kitagawa@enron.com or 403-974-6700.
691	Let me know if I can be any further help.

694	Grigs, I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons.
694	Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays.
694	Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d).
694	In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps.
694	Let me know if you learn anything further.
694	Chris
695	Did you receive the POA?
695	Chris
696	I'm in and hopefully I can even find a date.
696	Chris
697	They are wrong.
697	Chris
698	Nice Are you going to TO?
699	Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect.
699	The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case.
699	I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer.
699	Let me know if you have any thoughts.
699	Chris
700	Maria, That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns...
700	just snowballs....
700	How are things going down there?
700	I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty.
700	Hope all is well.
700	Chris
701	I'll give you a call later to discuss...
702	PLEASE ADVISE ASAP
703	Ryan, What's going on?
703	Give me a call at home.
703	214-0454 Talk to you later.
703	Chris
704	Apparently I have the wrong number.
704	Give me a call when you get out of the meeting.
704	Chris
705	You need to get set up on msn messenger.
705	I takes 2 seconds.
705	Ask an IT guy.
706	Sherry, This stuff looks perfect.
706	I think I like the 385-B the best.
706	I don't think I want the hutch though.
706	So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533).
706	Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock.
706	Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff.
706	Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House.
706	Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company.
706	Thanx for all the help!

710	OFFERS
711	higher now
712	Thanx for only sending the bullish reports.
712	They helped me come in from off the ledge.
713	Dave, I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning.
713	I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer.
713	If you would like we could look at doing an MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.
713	Chris
714	John, How is Dina doing?
714	Be sure to let us know when she has the baby/ Chris
715	$0.50 last
716	Did you use a market or limit order?
716	You don't need to lift offers in a falling market.
717	Did I send you this?
718	What press?
718	All the news I've read is great.
718	You're on crack.
719	Sorry to freak on you.
719	I'm a little stressed.
719	Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option.
719	It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you.
720	Last trade 0.70.
720	Success has worked for me so far.
721	Judy That is what I thought.
721	Have you heard anything regarding my refund?

776	Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario) Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave) Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98.
776	Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99.
776	Did that for a year.
776	Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good.
776	Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power.
776	Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year.

783	Hi everyone!
783	Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey.
783	Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network.
783	This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco.
783	The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great.
783	Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap.
783	Call me with any ?'s/ Chris
784	Did big brother kick you off IM?

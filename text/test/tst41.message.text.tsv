0	Susan, I need you to do the research on this meter.
0	You will need to review the various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 2/96.
0	You can also check with Volume Management to see if they have any info regarding the allocation of the point.
0	Let me know what you find out and I will work on getting a deal in place.
0	Daren
1	Kim, I will be out of the office next week.
1	Please get with Jennifer Sabine and go over these issues with her.
1	Daren
2	It will be fine to use current +1 as the cutoff.
2	Enron North America Corp.
3	Julie, I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into Jan 2000.
3	Thanks.
4	Vintage should be 93730.
5	Aimee, PG&E's numbers are correct.
6	What occurred at this point in prior months?
6	Who was allocated the volume?
7	Carlos, Please look into your Black Marlin info and see if you can find anything on this.
7	Thanks.
8	Charlotte, This is a desk-to-desk deal.
8	You need to get with the scheduler on the East Desk who handles Transco.
8	Both desks will need to tie in MOPS.
8	In this case, POPS most likely tried to update the HPL side, but the East Desk has not adjusted their side in MOPS.
9	Imelda, The following people (HPL Logistics) need access to view all Texas Desk positions/portfolios in Sitara Position Manager and Deal Ticker: Mandey MacKinnon George Grant Aimee Lannou Tom Acton Jackie Young Stella Morris Susan Trevino Kim Vaughn Charlotte Hawkins Robert Lloyd Pat Clynes Please update their security to allow for this.
9	Let me know if you have any questions.
9	Thanks.
9	Daren
10	Imelda, These people still need the Sitara access they currently have.
10	All are a part of the Texas Region.
10	Thanks.
11	Imelda, The following people are marketers on the Texas Desk: Tom Martin Jim Schweiger Greg McClendon James Mackey Craig Faulbaum Elsa Villarreal Carey Metz Lauri Allen Ed Gottlob Michael Morris Lee Papyotti Gary Lamphier
12	Pre-bid will be on Monday 1/24.
12	Enron North America Corp.
13	Ami Chokshi will be sending this to you once it is finalized.
14	Pat, You should have been included on this.
14	I probably won't go to these meetings since I won't be dealing with Unify much in the future.
14	I don't mind going with you for the first couple of times if you need me to, though.
15	FYI
16	Heather, Please include Pat Clynes on all Logistics information.
16	He now manages the HPL group.
16	Thanks.
16	Daren
17	Stella, The deal is in Sitara (#11121).
17	However, that point has been inactivated.
17	In OSS, you can manually enter the contract you need to allocate the volumes.
18	Richard, Please add Pat Clynes to your distribution list.
18	He now manages HPL Logistics.
19	Robert, Please look into this .
20	I have asked Robert Lloyd to look into this.
20	He handles our Industrial noms now.
21	I added 11/29-30 to deal 132030.
21	Give me a call if you have any questions.
22	Why do you keep changing your e-mail address?
22	How were your first few days back at school?
22	You haven't burned down your home making class, have you?
22	Anyway, hope you have fun this weekend.
22	Adios,
23	Kim, Deal 93485 has meter 7268 attached to it.
23	You can apply the flow to this deal.
23	You may need to renom from MOPS to POPS to get it through the systems.
24	Imelda, Steve Weller's access should be removed.
24	He is no longer involved with the Texas Desk.
24	The rest need to retain their access.
25	At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips sale.
25	Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 10,000.
25	The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.
25	So, I have created deal 148851.
25	Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.
25	If you have any questions, let me know.
26	The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas coming to us from them.
26	The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted.
26	The Tribo deal is good.
26	If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.
26	(I don't think they have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.) Carlos probably has a contat with Cox.
26	Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of their interests.
27	Someone in Producers Services.
27	You can call Vance Taylor and he can probably tell you.
28	Aimee, If you review that deal in CPR, you can see that this is a desk to desk deal on ECT.
28	This is actually our transport of Waha gas on PGE, delivered into HPL.
28	So, the volume should be scheduled/allocated to the ECT intrastate contract 012-27049-201.
29	Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?
29	Currently on deal 131478 (ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.
29	The sale on the TXU ticket has been zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.
29	If I need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.
29	But, I want to make sure that is what we need to do.
30	Ken, Thanks for your input.
30	I will definitely take this into consideration.
30	Also, I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done for me.
30	I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry; and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.
30	It has been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and argue with!).
30	Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.
30	I really appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a different view.
30	(I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you help me to do that.) You don't try to slip anything by, and you take responsibility for your work/actions.
30	That's hard to find these days.
30	I just wanted to let you know that.
30	Thanks.
30	But, I will still continue to think of you as in that Dilbert cartoon: "Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling. That's an indication that you have poor interpersonal skills."
31	The base purchase should be brokered with the base sale.
31	Deal 135563 does not replace the basse purchase ticket, it is in addition to that one.
31	On the days where deal 135563 is applicable, the purchases and sale should balance out; no flow.
32	So, is this ok now?
33	Hey, I think that we are coming in this weekend.
33	We are only going to be there through Sat nite though.
33	See you then.
34	Then 10,000 is already moved.
34	It just needs to be reallocated by vol Mgmt.
35	Sounds fine to me.
36	10,000 is being sold to ICC @ 2.84 on deal 131478.
37	Aimee, I assume that you are looking into this.
38	See comments below.
39	CR, This is one of the meters that you should broker for Entex.
40	FYI.
40	Again, Tom does not have this info yet.
40	So, please allow Gary and/or James to talk with him first.
41	New deals: Nov #151202 Dec #151203
42	See notes in red below.
42	In each case where the contract has been terminated, Tom and/or Carlos will need to get with Producer Services to determine what we need to do (set up a GTC, renegotiate the term deal, etc).
43	This relates to the message on missing deals.
44	Dave, Please add Pat Clynes to your distribution list.
44	He now manages HPL Logistics.
45	Done.
45	New Deal 151857.
46	See deal 151654.
47	I can't make any meeting at 8:00am.
48	1/00 Plan Allocations for RC 1497 - Farmer: 15% Gas Network Services 84% Gas Network Trading 1% Gas Network Development --> Time spent on Project Sally was primarily determining the estimated number of employees required to perform the Trading Support functions and reading the deal memorandum.
48	Daren
49	Pre-Bid meeting will be held 2/22 @ 3:30 pm.
49	Please reserve a conference room for about 20 people.
50	I am not available at that time.
50	I have 2 meetings already scheduled for that time/day.
50	Daren
51	No problem.
52	Hey, punk!!
52	Daren and Tonya
53	I can't be there.
54	Jackie, This is the spot deal we talked about last week.
54	Craig Falbaum is working on negotiating a price.
55	Stacey Neuweiler is my primary back-up (not really a lead since my group is so small).
55	She should be contacted if I'm not available.
56	Location for Pre-Bid is 30C1.
57	Lee, As Sitara currently stands, 500 of the 10,000 for EGP Fuels will be at Gas Daily.
57	See deals 139066 and 139068.\
58	I rolled the deal for Jan and Feb.
59	FYI.
59	We need to make sure that this kind of communication conitinues to flow downstream.
60	done
61	Shari, Sorry I'm so late with this.
62	Can we start this meeting later?
62	We will be trading until 10:30.
62	Since Greg McClendon is out of the office, Carey Metz is trading basis for him.
62	Because Carey is doing that, Stacey is needed to trade Waha.
62	And she is my backup on managing our position.
62	So, I need to be on the desk during trading.
62	Daren
63	Thu, I would be happy to join you in these type of meetings, but I can never meet before 11:00.
63	We begin trading each day at 8:30 am.
64	I can meet tomorrow from 1pm-3pm or Thusday after 1pm.
65	Jackie and Stella, I need ya'll to get together and work out how to handle this at Stratton.
65	I know that we get the estimated volume from Exxon daily and I would think that this volume will need to be allocated among the different deals.
65	But, Exxon will not have them broken out.
66	Congrats, Boy
67	I have scheduled a separate meeting Tomorrow from 2-3.
67	So exclude that time from our possible meeting times.
68	I thought that Brenda's meeting is on Tuesday the 8th.
69	FYI.
70	Ami, Please attend this.
71	done
72	I can meet anytime Monday afternoon.
72	I can meet after 4:00 on Tuesday, but not at 1:00.
73	Hey, Mom.
73	I got your message.
73	Just send the curtains whenever you get the chance.
73	Jo went to the doctor yesterday and everything is looking good.
73	She is going to start going to the doctor weekly.
73	Carrying the baby pretty low, so he's getting ready.
73	Jo thinks he'll be coming around the first part of March, the doctor didn't say that, though.
73	Anyway, tell Lacy "Good Luck".
73	I love ya'll.
74	I've extended the deal for the rest of the year, with a -0- nom.
75	Aimee, We don't enter 3rd party storage deals in Sitara.
75	You may want to talk to Kenny Soignet, but I thought that storage contracts were entered manually in POPS.
76	I have ceated deal 163005 to cover the flow for Feb
77	Michael (or Mike..what do you like to be called?), My schedule is open Thursday afternoon 1-5pm and Friday 1-4pm.
77	Let me know the what works best for you.
77	Earlier in the afternoon is usually best for me.
77	Daren
78	Mike, Thursday the 17th at 1:00 wil work for me.
78	I have reserved room 3125b.
78	We can meet at my desk (3138C) and walk over there.
78	Daren
79	Howard, The Park and Ride deals should be booked to a transport contract.
79	Desk to desk deals should be on the transport contract also.
80	Check out the following dates/times for a training session on HPL operations/gas flows/points.
80	I would allow about 2 hours to cover all questions.
80	We may only need an hour.
80	Thurs 2/10 any time after 1pm Fri 2/11 Lunch to earlier afternoon Tues 2/15 Lunch to 2:30 Let me know the best time for you and your group.
80	I am also going to invite the risk group (their schedule is flexible).
81	Tuesday the 15th is fine.
81	I will get a conference room and lunch set up.
81	We can start at 11:30.
81	I will send out an e-mail invitation to everyone in your group, my group and the risk group.
81	If you want to add anything or if you have something specific you want me to cover, just let me know.
81	Daren
82	Carey told me that he has already talked to Jennifer.
82	He should be able to give you any information you need.
82	Daren
83	Please plan on attending a training session over lunch on Tuesday, Feb 15th.
83	(Lunch will be provided.) I intend to discuss the operations of Houston Pipe Line; how gas is moved through the system, where our main supply and market areas are, locations of specific points, etc. We will be using a map of the pipeline as the basis for the discussion.
83	So, come to the meeting with any questions you have on HPL, anything is fair game.
83	Yvette is currently working on securing a room.
83	I will let you know when that is finalized.
83	Let me know if you have any questions.
84	We have no way to input a storage deal for Cilco.
84	The way that the contract is set up, does not fit into the systems as they are.
85	Tom, I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.
85	You will need to repath and renom this in MOPS.
85	Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.
85	Let me know if you have any questions.
86	Ami, Let Kim know when you have this done.
87	I have scheduled the HPL training session for Tues the 15th.
87	So I can't make this meeting.
87	Neither will the Tx Logistics group.
88	Please plan on meeting at 1pm on Thursday to continue discussions on the Midtex line.
88	I will let you know the location when it becomes finalized.
89	The meeting will be held in 3125A from 1:30 to 2:30.
90	Please attend one of these sessions.
90	Gracias.
91	Mom, That sounds good.
91	You can bring the curtains when you come.
91	What time do you think you can make it down here on Friday?
91	We will probably be leaving farily early to go to the rodeo (about 5:00).
91	We can have the girl across thestreet take care of Cole until you get there.
91	Daren
92	Stella and Charlotte, I looked into this deal.
92	We sold this gas for one day only.
92	In MOPS, the path was nominated for 1/26 only.
92	However, in POPS the path was nominated and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.
92	This should have been showing up as a bridgeback error during the month.
92	Also, someone should have identified that the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.
92	This discrepancy should have been found before we closed out January.
92	I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).
92	This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.
92	The resolution, not the problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an explanation of what happened.
92	Some one still needs to find out how the gas was confirmed for the 27th-31st.
92	Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the OBA.
92	Unless you can find a missing transport contract.
93	I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.
93	For example, we are giving an HPL training session today.
93	We should not have to give another full blown session in the future.
93	The group should be able to take this knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.
93	With the rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some knowledge has been lost.
94	Yvette, Where is this offsite taking place?
94	I know you told in the meeting the other day, but I didn't write it down.
95	Heather, I will be at an offsite meeting today.
95	Stacey Neuweiller will attend in my place.
95	Leave me a voicemail if you need me to do anything.
95	Thanks.
96	Look at the cc.
96	I'm an idiot.
97	I extended deal 93481 for another year.
98	Where are these meters?
98	What is happening?
98	What have we done in the past?
99	Heidi, I expect the wellhead volumes to be around 625,000 to 650,00 per day.
99	Enron North America Corp.
100	You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra gas on the 14th and 15th.
100	If they were, we can change the deal.
100	If not, the pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day.
101	I extended 95551.
102	Tom, Go ahead and increase the nom.
103	Thu, You need to get with Aimee and George on this.
104	As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.
104	Due to bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99.
104	(I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.) Please see the deal #s below.
104	HPLR Liquids 114099 & 169765 (existing deal to cover excess residue) Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.
104	Let me know if you have any questions.
105	Rita and Lisa, Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would work for your groups to have a training session.
105	(Over lunch or early afternoon) If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.
105	To help with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas where we transact.
105	(There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.) I did this with the Logistics group.
105	I think it went pretty well.
105	If you want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything.
105	Let me know.
106	FYI.
106	Gas Fair is 3/14-16.
107	FYI.
107	Due to this shut-in, I have taken deal 135714 to zero for the 17th-29th.
107	If you hear of this point coming back into service, please notify me.
108	We bought the gas from Koch Energy Trading (Deal 138613).
109	Done
110	Got your message.
110	Jo won't have your tax figured out until we get the Langston #.
110	But, she will be able to give you an idea soon.
110	The curtains do look good.
110	We are going to have to get a shade to use also, though.
110	The sun and lights come through pretty bright.
110	Gotta go.
111	Bruce, I need to hold the deliveries to 60,000 for 2/24.
111	I'm somewhat limited on my transport right now.
111	I will look into the possibility of increasing the volume, though.
111	If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley, that will work.
111	Daren
112	I know we transported on Midcon due to problems with the plant at the point.
112	I am not sure about the rate.
113	The purchase from Swift was shown at mtr 3405 during Dec and Jan. I have created a new deal (#204777) to add mtr 9643 to the deal.
113	Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.
113	This purchase is on 138544 for Jan 2000 forward.
114	Brenda, I may be involved in an options training class 2/28-3/7 from 4:30-6:30 each evening.
114	This is mandatory for the commercial guys, and Tom is trying to get me in also.
115	Robert, Ken developed an industrial report before he left.
115	It can be found at o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...
115	There is one file for each month of 2000.
115	I need you to update this for March.
115	This will need to be distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.
115	Let me know if you have any questions.
116	Tom, Go ahead and make these changes in Sitara.
116	Thanks.
117	Do I need to bring a pen and paper?
117	Is that considered "professional"?
117	I think it would be more impressive if you were taking my notes.
117	Let me know what you think.
118	Also...
118	What is the Enron dress code?
118	Do my clothes have to match?
118	I don't think I've really ever had a professional image.
118	Do I have to shave?
118	I don't think I've ever been anywhere on time.
118	This whole meeting thing is going to be difficult for me.
118	Just thought you needed to know.
119	That's fine.
119	Go ahead and change the deal if you need to.
120	Tom, For the EOG piece, bring the nom down to 4400 through the 7th.
120	For the 8th forward, leave the nom as is.
120	When we get more information next week, we can adjust as necessary.
120	Yates - What did they produce in Jan and Feb?
120	Let me know that and we can decide if we want to adjust the nom.
120	Vintage - Adjust our nom to tie with Vintage.
121	It's fine with me to allocate everything to Torch if they are paying for it.
122	Do you mean 12,000 at 6789?
122	If so that's fine.
122	Go ahead and bring the Yates down also.
123	I made the following industrial changes for March 3rd: Chevron decreased to 9500/day.
123	This should remain for the rest of the month.
123	Lyon-Citgo increased to 34,000.
123	This is an increase of 10,000 that will need to be rolled daily until further notice.
123	Shell Cogen increased by 5,000 to 45,000.
123	This will need to be rolled daily until further notice.
123	Let me know if you have any quesitons.
124	FYI
125	In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR Liquids at King Ranch.
125	This allocation resulted in a large physical unaccounted for loss.
125	Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our systems.
125	In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.
125	I have attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in February.
125	This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will need to be adjusted.
125	I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for February.
125	See the following: Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574 18,606/day Incorrect Liquids Sale: 72,500 2,500/day Adjusted purch from Liquids: 87,986 3,034/day We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the tailgate.
125	We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.
125	The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch plant through HGPL.
125	Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC, some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the plant.
125	It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated correctly among parties related to these transactions.
125	The attached schedule should assist in doing this.
125	I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys wellhead gas.
125	The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.
125	A transport usage ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.
125	Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.
125	Let me know what works best for you.
126	DONE
127	Mtrs 616 and 2538 are shrinkage and condensate meters.
127	Volumes are split among HPLR Liquids and HPLC, with the majority going to Liquids.
127	Mtr 894 is a gas loss meter.
127	Volume should be allocated to our operational ua4 contract.
127	Mtrs 2690 and 3396 should be allocated to Liquids.
127	You can see these allocations by viewing prior months in POPS.
127	On Monday afternoon, Clem Cernosek will verify the above transactions and expain the split between parties at 616 and 2538.
128	Cactus Swift is now ERAC: #169760 for Jan, #138094 for Feb
129	Let's shoot for Monday afternoon.
129	I will get a room set up for us.
129	Enron North America Corp.
130	Scott, I left a message with Vance and Melissa last night about the Base Gas Roll process.
130	Do you have time Monday afternoon to discuss this?
131	I updated deal 143709.
132	Can everyone meet at 3:30 today?
132	Please let me know.
132	Daren
133	I extended both deals.
134	Hey Ken, Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an interesting couple of weeks here.
134	Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some time off (I think that this is the 4th week).
134	So, we have picked up his trades.
134	Tom restructured the EOL trading.
134	Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.
134	(I'm still responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during trading.) In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.
134	And, of course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).
134	He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.
134	I don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.
134	I am getting very frustrated with the whole business.
134	It doesn't see that he even appreciates the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.
134	Wheww...That feels a little better...
134	getting some of that off my chest.
134	Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.
134	I think that baby is going to come along any day now (due date is still 3/18).
134	We are both definitely ready.
134	The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.
134	That's just too bad.
134	(I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some. I've got a real quick answer to that.) How are things at home?
134	Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?
134	I just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.
134	If things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for extra cash!
134	It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter.
134	(Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.) The grant price on the employee options is $55.50.
134	I hope everything is going good for you.
134	I would like to have lunch with you sometime.
134	I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do that.
134	Or...I can give you a call when I'm out for paternity leave and we can go one day then.
134	Talk to you later.
135	Mike, The following attachment contains the error message I received when trying to log in to POPS.
135	I need to get this fixed as soon as possible, since it is used to assist with our trading activities.
135	Thanks for your help.
136	Hey Sweet Baby!
136	Can you answer this?
136	I love you.
137	We cannot extend #151203.
137	I created a new deal for January 200 forward Julie - Will you attach a contract.
138	I would like to receive the guide.
138	My location is 3138c.
138	Daren
139	It was taken care of yesterday afternoon.
139	Thanks for your help.
140	Virginia, Please reserve a spot for me at the Pig Out Luncheon on 3/15.
140	Thank you.
140	Daren
141	Please CC Stacey neuweiler and Ami Chokshi on any wellhead changes.
141	Thanks.
142	Don't bother with changing the nom.
143	Hold off on changing the noms.
143	Let's see how they flow over the weekend and decide on Monday or Tuesday on whether to make adjustments or not.
144	The bridgeback will take care of changing the volumes from the 1st.
145	Julie, Is the contract with Cokinos on deal 151669 valid for Feb and Mar 20000?
146	I extended the deal at mtr 6719 to include 2/10.
146	In the future, please run all wellhead deals through Tom Acton first.
146	I've got a message into Julie Meyers to look into the contract at meter 9676, and will let you know what she determines.
147	What have they been flowing for the past week?
148	Make the nom change.
149	got it
150	Drop the nom to 11,000.
151	Aimee, You need to set up a transport capacity ticket in Sitara for this.
151	Heidi Withers should be able to help you.
151	I don't know the contract to apply to the deal.
151	Heidi or Julie Meters may be able to help with this also.
152	Keep them at 12,000 in Sitara.
153	ATEs is incorrect.
153	There should not be a specialist in my group.
154	George, Are you looking into these variances?
155	This deal was done with Greg Stockard.
156	I have extended deal 151669 to cover mtr 9676 for Feb and Mar.
157	I have created deal 222844 to cover this meter.
157	The deal ticket has zero volume.
157	Just allocate the actuals at the end of each month.
158	I have created deal 223865 (zero volumes) to cover this name change.
159	Dan, ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines (listed below).
159	Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to HPL.
159	Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.
159	What is the process used to accomlish this?
159	We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.
159	Thanks.
159	Daren
160	We do not have deal to enter for this.
160	You need to look at the entire Midtex line for each of the days that are out of balance.
160	If we are short at Katy, I would think that we would be long at Dewville.
160	(Many times, our receipts from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the Tap.) This should help you fix the January problem.
160	Also, for December, you may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.
160	Is it at HPL Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex line?
160	In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.
160	The only other remedy is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.
161	The actuals should be allocated to the new ticket which has been nom'd, tracked.
161	and balanced.
162	No, deal 156071 is good for days 7-29.
163	We should have everything from Vance by tomorrow (NX2).
164	I don't have any expected volumes.
164	You should use the best information you have from prior months.
165	Were these deals confirmed?
165	What are the pipes and contracts?
166	unsubscribe
167	For April, We agree to nominate 60,000 into Eastrans.
167	With redeliveries of: 50,000 into PG&E 7,800 into HPL at Fuels Cotton Valley 2,200 to HPL at Carthage Pricing for any additional volumes will need to be renegotiated.
167	You may contact either myself or Stacey Neuweiler.
168	For volumes in excess of the 60,000 on our term agreement which were redelivered to HPL at Mobil Beaumont, we agree to pay Inside Ferc HSC-.045 for the month of March.
168	The price at which HPL delivered the gas at Eastrans remains at Inside Ferc HSC-.04.
168	Daren Farmer
169	Don't we have an OBA at this point now?
170	Is this still outstanding?
170	Craig is back in the office now.
171	The deal for March was actually #210507.
171	I rolled it for one day.
172	yes
173	This is Daren.
173	Who are you?
174	Are you going to nom these volumes for the rest of the month?
175	This is in reference to Sitara # 228914.
175	Gracias, Amiga.
176	Steve, How are things going with this request?
176	FYI.
176	The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.
176	Only sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.
176	Thanks.
176	Daren
177	Tom, Leave the noms the way they are in Sitara.
177	These volumes are so small, there is no need to adjust anything.
178	No, I don't want to.
179	Just kidding.
179	That would not be a problem.
179	Do I need to give a review of our earlier Sitara training also?
179	Let me know what you want.
180	Imelda, Look on the Texas tab.
180	I've made some comments beside the names.
180	These adjustments are for HPLC and Texas.
180	We no longer handel EFSC.
181	Mtr 1534 - I created deal 238899 for 3/2-31/00 and #238900 for Apr. Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal.
181	When Elsa gets back next week, I will check with her to see if she did a deal with Encina on this day.
182	Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).
182	If you view the meter in MOPS you can see the deal.
182	(It had zero volume before today.) Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put in.
183	Please look into this.
184	Leave the nom as it is in Sitara.
185	I have created deal tickets 241558 and 241560 for July 99 - March 00 based on the info below.
185	Due to time constraints, I have not researched pricing and volumes, I trust that the info supplied to me agrees with the contract.
185	Robert - We need to get together tomorrow afternoon to set up April.
186	I rolled deal 128952.
187	Have you asked Karry Kendall about this meter?
188	Charlotte Hawkins should be able to help you with this.
189	Just leave the nom as is in Sitara.
189	We will look at all wellheads next week.
190	Leave as is in Sitara.
191	I have created deal 244531 to cover this flow.
191	Julie - This is actually volume related to the term deal 93804.
191	Volume flowed in March due to timing on changing the meter.
191	Can you attach the term contract to this deal?
191	(I copied the term deal to create the March ticket.)
192	March is consistent with Feb.
193	Charlotte, I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on Channel.
193	Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL #6490.
193	(Deals 83084 and 83088).
193	Why has this occurred each month?
194	Yes, you can create the deal ticket.
195	I will not be in the office on Friday.
196	Craig re-negotiated this deal, begining with April 2000.
196	Enron North America Corp.
197	Go ahead and make those changes.
198	I've changed the deal to 1 for the rest of this month and for May.
199	Yes, Who is this?
200	That's fine
201	Mike, What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?
201	I had a few items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.
201	Since I don't deal with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is: We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for each meter.
202	Bob, On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead of Unify.
202	So, these noms were not late.
202	For a couple of 3rd party pipelines, we do use Unify.
202	But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.
202	Our only problem was sending noms to HPL.
202	Which is sending information to yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline.
202	This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.
202	Let me know if you have any questions.

204	Enron North America Corp.
205	Put us down for 50.
206	That's fine.
207	Tom, Let's leave everything as it is currently and review the meters in a couple of days to see if the increases actually occur.
208	That works for me.

210	Cheryl, The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are: City of Brazoria Central Illinois Light Company D & H Gas Company, Inc. Markham Gas Merit Energy Partners Reliant Energy - Entex Reliant Energy - HL&P Southern Union Company Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co) Union Carbide Corporation Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most likely not happen again.
210	(HPL will trade with those counterparties.) All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.
210	We have reports which can be generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.
210	Let me know if you need something like that.
210	Let me know if you have any other questions.

211	Is this in index related price?

213	I've created deal 269123.
213	The pricing below looks in correct.
213	I have used 85% of Gas Daily, instead of Gas Daily less 85% (That would only be 15% of Gas Daily.) Please verify the price and let me know if we need to change the deal ticket.

219	Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.

219	Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.
219	Thanks.
219	Daren
220	Thanks.
221	Tom, Please handle this.
221	The deal is already out there for this time period.
221	You will probably need to send a zero nom.
222	Julie, What info do you have on the Praxair deal (#70171)?
222	Should this be on ENA or Cheryl D King
223	You may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the July trip to Tim.
223	When I talked to him today, he hadn't seen anything.
223	(My fault, I turned the names in late.) The real invitaion should be delivered to him soon.
224	CR and AL, We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.
224	At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.
224	We need to find out what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.
224	Did they deliverit to us at HPL?
224	Or did they cut Richardson?
224	Or, are they showing that we have gas stranded at that point?
224	Please look into this and let me know.
225	I will be out 6/9 on a customer trip (San Antonio with Aquila).
225	I will be on vacation in July from 1st-7th.

229	Let's keep the current noms in the system for now.
229	After a few days have flowed, we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed.
229	Enron North America Corp.
230	I have adjusted deal #152638 to cover the first 20 days of flow in Jan.
231	You need to get with the East desk on this.
231	Were they allocated this volume on Tetco?
231	If so, you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it.
231	If they were not allocated this flow, the volume should go on the OBA.
232	Bob, Go ahead and accept the nom revision.
232	I believe that this is with PGE, not El Paso.
232	How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?
232	I f they have a higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom there.
232	In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as possible to what we have in the system now.
232	Enron North America Corp.
233	This is a estimate for UA4, fuel, loss, and various other operational usages.
233	This deal should be handled like the other operational tickets in the system.
234	Steve, I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000.
234	Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.
234	But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.
234	ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point.
234	If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point.
234	This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time.
234	Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC.
234	Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.
234	Thanks for your help.
234	Daren
235	Done.
236	Is putting up with a bossy, domineering assistant, who makes fun of me, considered an accomplishment?
237	BH, Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.
237	I left the office sooner than planned.
237	This list is pretty slim.
237	I spent much time trying to learn to trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing reults for you.
237	With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to hire an additional person, this will change.
237	Let me know if you have any questions on my list of accomplishments.
238	Apply deal 269123 to contract 012-27049-201.
239	I can't make it.

242	Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 forward to deal #292249.
242	This should help some with amount of time it takes to update and bridge back this deal.
242	He is adjusting the swap tickets also.
242	You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.
242	The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time involved in updating the deal.
243	I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.
243	Late Friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of HPL.
243	The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.
243	Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at Gas Daily.
243	I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday forward.
243	Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact.
243	We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary.
244	I need a number where you can be reached on Friday evening.
244	I will be getting the schedule after work on Friday and will call and let you know when and where our games will be.

253	His number is 562-866-1755.
253	Could you give him a call and check this out?
253	I told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

261	Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).
261	The latest idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the office for half the day.

271	I am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up.

271	(Six days of flow.) I definitely don't think that we should any later.
271	It would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

276	During June, Coral transacted on EOL.
276	However, they selected a July thru October deal by mistake.
276	The marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in EOL.
276	Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound.
276	But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price.
276	Logistics will be brokering the transactions in MOPS.
276	Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.
276	Again, they will not have a record of the deals.

276	Let me know if you have any questions.
277	You need to discuss this with the East Desk.
277	See if Tetco allocated the vol to their contract.
278	I recevied a note from Janet Wallis stating that we need Gas Daily deals for imbalances at Colorado River Station (Mtr 8663) for Nov 99 and Mar 00.
278	I changed the pricing on the term deal 72349 to Gas Daily + .199 to cover these flows.
278	HC - Please have someone allocate the needed volumes to this deal ticket for these two months, and let Katherine know when completed.
278	Let me know if you have any questions.
279	458 deals 6 new, 452 existing
280	Deal 77352 is already out there for June.
281	Hillary, Can we extend deal 77352 for the rest of the year?
281	I tried to do this, but I got the message to add a contract.
281	This deal is set up in case GSF needs compressor fuel and should roll each month.
281	However, there is no line for July.
282	Done.
283	Esther, Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've invited him on.
283	Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.
283	The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.
283	I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.
283	I will probably have to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.
283	If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.
283	Daren
284	I created a new deal to capture this flow.
284	#333712 I also created a deal for July, #333718.
285	In order to account for the same day change at Katy, please schedule the following deals for 7/24/00 only: At Exxon Katy (Mtr 4132): Allocate -0- to deal 284599 Allocated 4,500 to deal 339604 At Lone Star Katy (Mtr 67): Allocate 5,000 to deal 341801(new deal) Allocate 5,500 to deal 341808 (new deal) Please remember that EOL deals are firm.
285	This means that we can't change the location, volume, or price on these deals.
285	If questions arise around an EOL deal, please make sure that your audience (traders, myself, etc.) knows that your are discussing an EOL trade.
285	Let me know if you have any questions.
286	I'll be there.
287	Nicole, The correct price is 4.50.
287	I changed the deal ticket.
288	Finney, Congratulations on the new baby!
288	Are you sure you picked up the right one at the hospital?
288	She is too cute to have anything to do with you.
288	Hope everybody is doing good and ya'll are getting at least a little sleep.
288	Daren
289	Mary, Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.
289	I am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect.
289	In POPS, the estimates vs acutals look odd.
289	The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in July, so we should not be receiving anything.
290	See registration form below.
291	We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.
291	So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.
292	Dave, This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.
292	We did not get this info., so Sitara was not adjusted.
293	Name Tags: Daren Farmer Tonya Farmer
294	I'll be there.
294	I mean it this time.
294	Really.
295	Bob and Mary, Please talk to Vance Taylor about this.
295	Daren
296	The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been terminated.
296	Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 forward.
296	Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).
296	The 1,500/day should be schueduled on this deal.
296	Let me know if you have any questions.
297	FYI
298	I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently: 1) After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to interview her.
298	Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.
298	Pat Clynes fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately called Toni to get it straightened out.
298	Toni called me at home, which is good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to discuss information with me.
298	2) At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.
298	This has improved over the last week.
298	She has called me a couple of times awaiting my decision on salary concerns.
298	So, I think that she is trying to stay on top of this now.
298	Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.
299	The measurements: 38x66 with fold-out leaf The wood is pretty dark.
299	I have a couple of pictures at EB 3211F if you want to see them.
300	I'm already schedule for another meeting from 1-2:30 on Thurs.
300	I am open after that.
301	Mary, These are transport related tickets.
301	Is this something that your group would look into?
302	Test reply.
303	An adjustment is required on the Tufco contract for July 2000.
303	The volume for the 23rd was overstated by 5,000.
303	This resulted in revisions on the 23rd and 28th.
303	Please see the attached Tufco.
303	If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.
304	John, I need information on the following questions related to Cornhusker: 1) I understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of the supply, transport, and sales contracts.
304	Who will be handling the financiol accounting and reporting for these deals?
304	2) Is someone in Legal currently assigning the contracts to ENA?
304	3) What is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant?
304	4) Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the pipeline for July and August activity.
304	Is this true?
304	I thought we weren't taking responsibility for this until September business.
304	We are not prepared to pay the suppliers for July.
304	5) Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book?
304	Thanks.
304	Daren
305	Is this single or double elimination?
306	These have been sold.
307	I'm working hard for you!
307	Now at 83.5.
307	I need a new lawnmower, so I'll try to bump it up a little more.
307	Hope you're doing good.
308	Melissa, I show that we also had 20.000 at LS HPL for the 13th.
308	Daren
309	The new fixed price deal with Equistar is #365013.
310	Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.
310	We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take excess volumes over the base nom.
310	We have been estimating the overtakes each day at 15, 000.
310	However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.
310	So, Equistar is within their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual doesn't reflect this.
310	This occurs with a few of our industrial points.
310	Enron North America Corp.
311	I'll be there.
312	Which direction should I go on 610?
313	This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL.
313	However, the pathing in Unify is correct.
313	HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.
313	Daren Enron North America Corp.
314	I will play again, but not on Wednesday nights.
314	Any other night is fine.
315	I rolled ceal 329242 for Aug 1.
316	No, we have transported on Tejas a few times this year also (on and off).
316	Carlos should be able to tell you when.
317	Who does Lone Star show as the transporter on their side, if anyone?
317	Do we have an OBA at this point?
318	Melissa, Lone Star is showing the LS HPL LSK IC at zero for 7/24.
318	We have it in as 2,500, as you do in this e-mail.
318	Please look into your Lone Star transport on this date and let me know what you find.
318	Thanks.
319	I am calculating that only 44,374 should be applied to the HPLR IFERC contract at the Tap to finish the obligation for the month.
320	These deals should be converted to ENA-IM Texas.
320	Is there a way that you can change all of these deals systematically?
321	Please see the attached Tufco file for July.
321	The 2,500 under the Wagner Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that day).
321	This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also.
321	Let me know if you have any questions.
322	Jackie, What does MOPS show for the days in question?
322	It would be incorrect to add any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.
322	It sounds as if the meter was allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in MOPS.
322	Let me know what you find in MOPS.
323	Lee, FYI.
323	Enron Methanol has been taking about 5,000 swing each day for August.
323	So, I added 5,000 for September (#139057 @ GD) in addition to the 34,000 they
324	You may want to come to this meeting.
324	When we met with Bob Hall the other dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were occurring each month.
324	If you have something else going on, don't worry about being there.
324	I'll relay the info to you.
325	I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates: Mar 11-31 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045 April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.
325	An outage occurred on the 5th, so the deliveries to Mobil didn't acutally start until the 12th.
325	If you need anything else, let me know.
325	Daren
326	Katherine, There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara: 1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.
326	2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.
326	I can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.
326	Let me know how you want to handle it.
327	See Below in Blue.
327	Thanks for your help.
328	I do not have Access on my system.
329	I corrected the deal.
329	The price should be Waha Index +.01.
330	Done.
331	I rolled deal 331917.
332	10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.
332	Nothing should be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.
332	Additionally, it looks like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the 16th.
332	This should be -0- also.
332	By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis (Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.
333	Marlene, After discussions with the desk, we have decided to keep the Oasis contracts under ENA.
333	So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.
333	Let me know if you have any questions.
334	You must've had a rough weekend.
334	I haven't seen this many screwed up e-mails from you in a while.
334	Or...is that 110 degree heat finally taking it's toll?
335	Marlene, Stacey put the contracts in intercompany mail before I got this notice.
335	Sorry.
335	Send them to us again and we will get them signed and returned quickly.
336	Robert, There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.
336	Two for HPL and one under ENA.
336	Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?
336	Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract and HPL contract?
337	Russ, I would like for the following people from the Texas region to attend: Liz Bellamy Mary Poorman Susan Hadix Tom Acton Mark McCoy Eddie Janzen Let me know if this group is too large and move some to a later date.
337	Thanks.
338	done.
339	CR, Can you get with Duke and see if this gas should have been at Centana into Mobil instead of HPL?
340	Pat, I think that we should probably send the newest people to the first training.
340	What do you think?
340	Liz, Susan, Mary, Sabrae?
341	Russ, We will send Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae to this training.
341	Thanks.
342	Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend from Texas.
342	I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members of the group attended this first meeting (Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae).
342	Russ will set up another session at a future date for others (Tom, Eddie, Mark).
342	Let me know if you have any questions.
343	Mary, You can roll this if you need to.
343	I usually leave it up to logistics to update the trans usage tickets like this.
344	Julie, Please review deal 133010.
344	The deal shows evergreen, but nothing rolled to September.
345	Thanks.
346	Julie, In Sitara, the following purchases expire with no evergreen flag.
346	Please let me know if this is correct for these contracts.
346	Deal 113858 - Teco Gas Processing expires 12/31/00
347	Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.
347	The deal has not been finalized through legal.
347	However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make some money before we finalized it.
347	The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 8/31.
347	On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.
347	Because things were not set up, I could not enter the deals until now.
347	Please review the following deals and settle with the customers.
347	Buy from Tenaska IV July 399763 Aug 399773 Sell to Tenaska Marketing July 399791 Aug 399797 Sell to ANP Aug 399814 The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".
347	Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany mail.
347	(I received both invoices this week) I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.
347	Tanks.
348	I will be there.
349	FYI.
349	The research group keeps a web page updated with the latest weather info.
350	Kris, Please forward this to the appropriate person.
350	We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) Pipeline.
350	This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.
350	Duke (Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 5 months.
350	The deal in Sitara is #145125.
350	Please look into this and let me know where we stand.
350	Thanks.
351	Diane, I apologize for getting this to you so late.
351	I should have no staffing additions next year.
351	Staff Manager 1 Sr. 2 Average to High Training Both Seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (Effective Communication) and 1 Technical class.
351	I think that everything else should roll for next year.
351	Let me know what else I need to give you.
352	FYI.
352	I will be out of the office tomorrow, 9/19/00, for jury duty.
352	Please contact Stacey Neuweiler (3952) or Liz Bellamy (6029) if you need anything.
353	Well, I got selected.
353	The judge estimated that we would probably be there through Friday.
353	I will be in the office each morning until 9:15 and may return some evenings.
353	If you need anything, you can leave me a voice mail or call Liz and Stacey.
354	Please read the message below.
354	What do you think about increasing the fee?
355	The Cleburne Plant will be down for an outage during the following time period: 9/25-10/4 entire day So, we will have about 45,000/day to sell.
355	The supply costs are $2.777 for
356	We created deal 229758 a while back to correct this.
356	You will need to get Vol Mgmt to reallocate volumes from #157288 to this deal to close it out.
357	FYI
358	HSC-.0825 is the correct price, based on the final agreement.
358	I have corrected the deal in Sitara.
359	Done.
360	I have rolled or input the following deals for October.
360	So, I am showing that the only deals we have outstanding for Oct are: Julie - Please check these deals for the correct contract/terms.
360	Also, please look into Heatherlock.
360	Vance is noming gas for this deal.
360	However, the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag.
360	When I tried to roll another month, I got a message that another contract was needed.
360	Thanks.
361	Please adjust the deals in Sitara to reflect this change.
362	Mark, It looks like we will probably take over the Cornhusker deal in October.
362	So, I need you to get the following information for Lone Star, Williams, and Apache: Contact Name Phone # Fax # Mailing address We will be sending notices to these parties indicating our agency agreement with the plant (Tenaska IV Texas Partners Ltd.) Additionally, we will need this information from the plant manager.
362	Please gather this information as soon as you can from Nancy Stivers.
362	Thanks.
363	I have entered the following deals into Sitara for October: Camden Resources Inc. @ mtr 9858, 3000/day #420113 (This counterparty is not currently in the system) These deals have not been finalized as of yet.
363	But, I have entered them to assist us with managing our postion and scheduling the pipe.
363	Let me know if you have any quesitons.
364	Melissa, It would help us considerably if Vance would include the prices for new deals in the monthly nom.
364	In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas, we need to put the deals into Sitara.
364	We will enter spot deals with the info Vance gives us.
364	When the deals are ticketed, the risk group will adjust Sitara with the finalized terms.
364	Thanks for your help.
364	Enron North America Corp.
365	Please see below.
366	ENA Contact Daren Farmer
367	FYI
368	I rolled this deal for day one in October only.
368	Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.
368	Has it terminated or should it roll for October.
368	I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.
369	These are not spot deals.
369	PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange.
369	However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.
369	According to the contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.
369	So, in order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.
369	This occurred in August and September.
369	Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.
369	Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in place.
369	(PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas Daily -.10) Enron North America Corp.
370	I have no idea why payment would be suspended.
370	I don't remember having any problems with Ocean Energy.
370	Sorry.
371	Done.
371	I could not seperate the excess charge and cashout charges under the demand expense.
371	They are combined on the ticket.
371	Enron North America Corp.
372	I fixed it.
372	Enron North America Corp.
373	Megan, I have made these adjustments.
373	HOwever, I would like for you to double check August.
373	We knew that Pan Energy would be over delivering at Cotten Valley for 8/9/00 through the end of the month.
373	So I changed the pricing on the deal to the GD-.10 settlement price for that time period.
373	Enron North America Corp.
374	I had problems in getting the newest version of Access.
374	So, please see the attachement below related to the OPM Hours Survey.
375	Carlos, Can yuou get with Rebecca on this?
375	It seems like we took care of this earlier.
376	Suzanne, I was out last week, so I am just now getting back with you.
376	We primarliy served the Texas Desk commercial team, with about 10% of time spent on Producer Services.
376	The non routine activity should be allocated to the Texas Desk.
377	FYI.
377	Forward the info to me for anyone you want to send cards to.
378	Heather, I will have my group gather the names and I will forward them to you.
378	When do you need everything?
379	The price should be 3.56.
379	There had been alot of price and volume discussions for this gas day and 8/1/00.
379	I checked the notes and found that we actually settled at 3.56 instead of 3.58.
380	Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say that Duke should be paying us for the gas.
380	I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I wasn't sure to whom.
380	I either talked or left a message with someone in the settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the trader that they should not be getting the invoices.
380	However, I never heard back from anyone.
380	This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this year.
380	The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.
380	I can change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.
380	You will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct contract in place for the deal.
381	Sandi, Sorry for just now getting back with you.
381	I was out last week.
381	The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.
381	The fee will be adjusted yearly based on CPI.
381	Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).
381	I think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis.
381	We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at the 45,000 base.
381	I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.
381	Do you agree with this?
382	Megan, For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange deal.
382	Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement will occur at GD-.10.
382	Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this day.
382	Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal.
382	I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.
382	For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.
382	Due to operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday.
382	I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier.
382	Enron North America Corp.
383	Sandi, The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).
383	In the event that we have to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV.
384	I created deal #439909 for August.
384	Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.
384	Currently, we have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.
384	Since this was flowing on the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September?
385	Has this been resolved?
386	JM, The message below is related to deal #138094.
386	According to Joan, October is the last month for this deal.
386	However, the evergreen flag is activated in Sitara and a new line has been created for November.
386	Can you look into this please?
387	Consumer Price Index
388	I have created two new deals in Sitara.
388	You will need to get with someone in Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals for Jan-Sep.
388	The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward.
388	Deal #s: Let me know if you have any questions.
389	done Enron North America Corp.
390	You're right.
390	I have corrected the ticket.
391	JM, Is the contract for this deal still valid?
391	I want to roll the deal for Sep and Oct.
392	FYI.
392	I changed the pricing on the September deal (#386540) to IF HSC-.05 from HSC
393	Another national crown ...
393	It must be nice.
393	We have to keep referring back to our one and only in 1935.
393	But, we will never forget it!
393	I am looking forward to the 28th.
393	Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.
393	We'll see how that goes.
393	Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that weekend.
393	That should be a good battle.
393	OU also has a week off to get ready for you.
393	(I think they should be rated #2).
393	Things are going ok here.
393	I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of HPL.
393	That is getting closer to happening.
393	I am hoping it does.
393	I'm ready to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.
393	Ami Chokshi decided that she would leave the co.
393	this week.
393	She is heading of to San Fran.
393	No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has wanted to do.
393	It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like that.
393	How's everything else going for you and the family.
393	We are all doing pretty good.
393	I actually took last week off.
393	The only plans I had were to spend time with the family.
393	It was great!
393	It really drove the point home that I need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.
393	Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?
393	I'm sure it's been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.
393	Let me know.
393	Sorry I haven't talked to you much.
393	I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I don't change my ways.
394	Why don't you come to the office around 11:00.
394	(I'll be trading Waha until 10:30 or so.) You can come up and say "hi" to everyone.
394	Or, we can just meet in the lobby and walk over.
395	We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.
395	And will probably adjust it again in a few days.
395	Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.
395	So, this will not have an impact on UA4.
396	Lee, On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 12,000/day.
396	Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?
396	Will we have a swing deal with them for the winter?
396	The current swing deal is for Oct only.
396	For Oct, they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.
397	We are on the 32nd floor now (Thru the glass door and turn right), if your badge still works.
397	Or, give me a call from the Lobby and I'll come get you.
397	Would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us (Carlos, Lauri, etc)?
397	It doesn't matter to me.
398	Robert will be coming too.
398	He said that he will be buying your lunch, since you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year.
398	Just kidding.
399	FYI.
399	You may want to check with someone to see if this will affect you this weekend.
400	Susan, Are you clear on what you need to do with this?
401	PW, HPL's spot and base purchases by zone for April 2000 are reported in the attached file.
401	Let me know if you have any questions.
402	I created #454057 for the flow at Mtr 5192.
402	Canny Conner is looking into mtr 6387.
402	I will let you know when he determines what we will be doing.
403	Hey, Dwight.
403	Everything is going fine here.
403	Thanks for your message.
403	I'm feeling pretty confident with how things are going.
403	I have received very positive feedback from my manager and my employees.
403	I have learned much from you, especially related to communication: recognizing the different types of people, different ways to communicate.
403	And, I appreciate the time you've spent with me.
403	However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being.
403	When I'm in need of some "managing expertise" in the future, I will give you a call.
403	Again, thanks for working with me.
403	Daren
404	Mike, Based on the screen today and current spreads, we may be able to market the excess volumes (in the Waha region) at the following levels for 2001: Jan 4.65 Feb 4.47 Mar 4.26 Apr 4.04 May 3.97 Jun 3.96 Jul 3.96 Aug 3.95 Oct 3.96 Nov 4.06 Dec 4.17 Of course, these are only forecasts and are very volatile.
404	If you need anything else, or have any questions, let me know.
404	Daren
405	I have adjusted deals 436187 and 413538.
406	Password is now cole1jake.
407	Deal 386264 has a start date of 9/1/00.
408	JM, Can you extend the contrtact on deal 138605 thru 10/2/00 ?
409	This should be allocated to the liquids group's transport.
410	Come by anytime today.
410	I've already made the check out.
410	I will be leaving early today (sick kids and wife at home), but I will leave the check and tickets on my desk.
411	Jackie, Please get with the East Desk on this.
411	If they agree, we can roll the deal.
412	Stace, Please look into your notes.
412	You entered deal 214948 each day for the purchases at this meter for the month.
412	The 12th and 13th are ok in Sitara.
412	However, there is nothing for the 15th and 16th.
413	Sorry about this, Victor.
413	I didn't even pay attention to the date.
413	I was thinking this was October business.
413	We will definitely be able to do somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.
413	Enron North America Corp.
414	Jackie, I didn't pay any attention to the date on this message.
414	We should be able to handle this on our side with out involving the East Desk.
414	If the OBA can be used, apply the volume there.
414	If nothing else, we can write it off.
415	Charlene, Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.
415	You may need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.
415	I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.
416	Liz, Please look into this.
417	Please move my group from Risk to Logisitcs.
417	Enron North America Corp.
418	I don't know what PC 12667 is.
418	But, in the attached spreadsheet, my cost center is grouped with Risk Management.
418	I now report to Bob Hall, so CC 105633 should be reported with the other Logistics groups.
419	Liz - I would like for you to attend also.
419	Stace - You can decide if you want to come or not.
420	LA, Can you look into the Transport piece?
420	We need similar numbers for Sep 2000.
421	For this meeting, I will need a laptop and a projector in the conference room.
421	Can you take care of getting this for me?
422	You can charge it to mine.
423	Patrick, The attached file contains the base and spot purchases by zone on HPL for September 2000.
423	Let me know if you have any questions.
424	The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of October.
424	We had zero in the system after the 6th because the plant was down.
424	The deal should have been nom'd at zero on these days.
425	I rolled deal 418382 for Nov 1st.
426	done Enron North America Corp.
427	I have created the following operational tickets to cover the Big Sandy UA4 and fuel (1/99-12/00): Receipt 475647 Delivery 475648 Settlements with Teco should be booked to the existing deals: HPL Purchase Let me know if you have any questions.
428	The notice should be given on Monday, the 20th by 5:00 pm.
429	Why couldn't they figure this out?
430	I think I hate football too.
430	4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, run, to pass the ball.
430	Why not Ja'mar??
430	The guy who carried 3 defenders into the end zone earlier.
430	Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from your friend Mary.
430	So things are not all bad.
430	How did the Corn boys lose?
430	If I would have known about it on Saturday, I would have called to console you and the family.
430	Maybe it's time to just turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.
431	Why is there a different deal?
431	And what is the price?
432	This has been corrected.
432	A transport usage ticket should have been used, instead of a desk to desk.
432	Enron Capital Management
433	I added these days to #483894.
434	Rolled deal 454057 to cover flow at mtr 5192.
435	Charlene, We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.
435	No price was negotiated that I can find.
435	However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last price on the deal to cover those days.
435	What price is Hesco showing?
436	The old swing deals should not be used for October.
436	Please have Volume Management allocate any volumes on the old deals to the new deals.
436	Enron North America Corp.
437	JM, Is the contract on 461059 good for Nov?
438	I changed the price to 2.85.
438	With the changes in personnel on the desk, we don't have a lot of info to dispute their price.
438	It's not cost beneficial to do so anyway.
439	Fred, Please look at the attached file below.
439	Can you give me the October volumes for these meters?
440	Hey, AC!
440	How are things going for you?
440	Liking your new freedom, wild girl?
440	I hope your having fun.
440	I'm sure missing you on Entex.
440	I'm already feeling the heat from TM.
440	With the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts, I have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.
440	But, that's the way it always is over here.
440	I've been meaning to e-mail you, but I always remember after I leave the office.
440	Anyway, let me know how it's going.
440	Later,
441	Done.
441	FYI.
441	Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.
441	This should clean up the allocations for this area.
441	Also, beginning on Nov 15th, we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a spot agreement (#484935).
441	Let me know if you have any questions.
441	Enron North America Corp.
442	The buy and sale should net out, nothing to be billed to paid to TGLO.
442	The volumes should be the same on both sides.
442	Whoever backs up Tom should reallocate in POPS to make this happen.
442	We had to show a buy/sale in order to schedule the delivery to TGLO on a third party pipe.
443	I extended deal 461059 for the rest of October.
444	Thanks for the info.
444	I appreciated the call the other day.
444	It really helps me out to recieve info early like that.
445	Gary thinks that we will not have any problems with this.
446	This is the course.
446	The 7th is fine.
446	I also have Brandy looking into the tuition reimbursement deal.
446	Apparantly, the person she needs to talk to is out of the office.
447	For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.
447	We bought gas from Apache and Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.
447	We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the Cleburne plant was operating.
447	On days the plant was not operating, we sold that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA).
447	For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into that.
447	With the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a couple of months, there are some questions on how to handle Sep. I'll let you know what I determine about Sep. Enron North America Corp.
448	If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).
448	It is possible that we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.
448	In that case, we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other pipes also.
448	Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed on to the plant.
448	If you have any questions, let me know.
449	You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?
449	An onside kick after you've won the game?
449	What was Barnett thinking?
449	I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery.
449	I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar.
449	Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?
449	Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 ft christmas tree?
449	Or was it bigger this year?
449	We made the journey to Tuscaloosa.
449	The trip wasn't too bad.
449	That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.
449	I ate way too much, but it sure was good.
449	Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.
450	Any processing is handled by Devon.
450	ENA is buying the residue gas at the tailgate of the plant.
451	We need to have all the links and the spreadsheets updated by the 3rd workday of December (12/5).
452	9/30 #420864 (This deal is under Samedan) Are there any other days on the invoices?
453	MP, Apply that volume to the Cannon Storage deal.
453	The meter is already on the ticket for that time period.
454	Apply this volume to deal 101303.
454	The point is on the ticket, but nothing was nom'd that day.
455	Buy Apache #384247 Buy Williams 384237 Trans Capacity Lone Star 452491&452475 Spot sales will be on various tickets throughout each month.
455	Deals are under the Cleburne Intramamonth Position in Sitara.
456	Megan, I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska deal.
456	This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.
456	Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be scheduling this deal as a zero nom.
456	Hopefully, this will allow the demand charge to flow through the system.
456	Let me know if you don't see this happening.
456	For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the imbalance pool).
456	When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I will change the demand charge.
456	I took the demand charge off of the sale ticket (#384258).
457	That's not Cole and Jake, Baby....
457	Do you know what our kids look like?
458	Mike, You can come down anytime.
458	The mornings will be the best time to learn, but you can spend as much time as you want.
458	Since things are so crazy, I may not be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them later.
458	I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.
458	You can start with me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.
458	We usually start trading around 8:30.
458	We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather meeting.
459	You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.
459	Ask them about their Lone Star transport allocation.
459	They had to transport the gas on Lone Star to sell to us.
459	So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match the sale volume.
459	Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the transport allocation.
460	We're working on it.
460	We have had alot of issues with the colder weather.
460	I will let you know as soon as we get Oct in. I adjusted #514353, so hopefully the demand will come through better.
460	Enron North America Corp.
461	that's fine
462	Never used it.
463	I think Mark got everything in last night.
463	You may have to have Vol Mgmt send things through.
463	Look into it and let me know how it looks.
463	I will probably be out of the office on Monday, returning on Tuesday.
464	Attached is the preliminary agency agreement related to the Cleburne Plant.
464	This is strictly confidential, so please do not pass this info on to others.
464	I will let you know when we have finalized the contract and send you a copy.
465	Hey, Ken.
465	Wouldn't this be great?
465	It's a little hard to read, but that's the way I got it.
466	Hey, Ken.
466	Thought you would like this.
466	It's a little hard to read, but that's the way I received it.
467	I have rolled the Hilcorp deal.
467	I will get Gary to look into the Williams deal.
468	Gary, The deal with Williams Terminals expired in Oct. However, about 3,800 flowed for Nov. Do you need to renegotiate this deal for Nov. Or, do we roll it under the terminated k?
468	What do think about Dec?
469	What was going on in Feb?
470	cpr: jungle pops: daren unify: jungle
471	I created # 529824 for Nov and Dec.
472	In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related to the Cleburne plant.
472	However, for October 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing money to Tenaska IV.
472	I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk.
472	(Please see the attached schedule.) We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.
472	Do we need to pay this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do this?
472	This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future.
472	Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.
472	Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.
472	Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse Tenaska IV.
473	possibly friday.
473	I will take Mon the 18th off also.
474	HOw much does that cost?
474	I mayh run it through Tom's RC.
475	We should not be paying Tenaska's Lone Star transport for Sep. That should be paid by Tenaska IV.
475	We took over the payments with October production.
476	I'm cool with it.
477	I moved the Cannon sale volumes from #170335 to #529753 effective 12/14/00.
477	You will need to re-nom #529753 for all prior days at zero and then allocate volumes at each meter from the old deal to the new deal.
477	Let me know if you have any questions.
478	Tonya and I will be there.
479	With PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.
479	I am not able to follow your ua4 calculation.
479	However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout September and October.
479	(This should have been pathed to the Lone Star transport k in Unify).
479	Is this in that ua4 number?
479	Williams had been trying to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume came in greater than booked.
479	(Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes vary each day from scheduled.) The volumes that they were trying to make up would go toward the transport imbalance also.
479	I would think that Cleburne will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.
479	After Novemeber, the imbalance should be fairly small.
479	Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have that number.
479	(When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was very large. When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices if the opportunity came up.) The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.
479	But, I will discuss that with Legal.
479	The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.
479	I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.
479	We can get together then if you would like.
480	I can meet on Friday from 12:00-2:00 or Wednesday anytime after 1:00pm.
480	Wednesday would be the best for me since we will be into bidweek on Friday.
480	But, I will make it work.
481	Hey, Ken.
481	Well, the folks are fine.
481	But, they have a few friends who lost just about everthing.
481	In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) items from their home (only one family picture) .
481	I understand that alot of homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.
481	It was very bad.
481	What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in. When we talked to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was.
481	Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?
481	I took friday and Monday off and tried my luck at it.
481	I didn't last too long.
481	It doesn't seem right to be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think I'm becoming a scrooge.
481	Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in the Christmas mood.
481	Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels and monster trucks).
481	Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.
481	We've told him "no" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while he's grabbing for one.
481	He is a handful.
481	Jake has also started taking steps.
481	He just turned 9 months old this month.
481	That's a little over a month earlier than Cole started taking steps.
481	Anyway, I need to go.
482	I have tried to approve this a few times, but it does not appear to work.
482	What is the process to approve this in the system?
482	Daren
483	Esther, Please add me to your First Delivery distribution.
483	Thanks.
484	I tried to approve this a couple of times, so it should be taken care of.
485	Aimee, I have updated deal 15765 in Sitara for this change effective today.
486	This gas should be allocated to deal 70499 (Unit Gas Transmission).
486	That point is already on the ticket (under ENA).
487	We should probably take this deal to zero.
487	Carlos - Please check with measurement to determine if this volume is correct.
487	We may have some bad information feeding through.
488	FYI.
489	This volume should be allocated to deal 138642 for Jan. The meter has always been on the ticket, but with zero volume.
490	done
491	Didn't the deal that Victor extended cover these days?
491	I don't think anything should be adjusted on the Dynegy deal.
492	Aimee, The Global Octanes plant crashed last night.
492	The undertakes (volume below the base load sale) will not go to the buyback.
492	This is considered a force majeure.
492	Do not allow any volumes to be allocated to the buyback until notified by either Lee Papyoti or myself.
492	Thanks.
493	OW, I have changed the pricing on deal 132975 for this message.
493	Please adjust the risk assignment.
494	We already have a deal in place.
494	#461059 with Torch-Rally.
495	Luis, Please see the attachment.
495	This file shows deals that still need adjustment stemming from the base gas program being kicked off for Dec. Please have these corrected also.
495	Thanks.
495	The "arranged_quantity" column contains the correct volume.
495	Daren
496	I have extended #254839.
497	Any sales made to MGI off of HGPL or HPL should be billed by the Texas Desk.
497	However, HPL will not invoice MGI.
497	All trades are done under ENA.
497	Daren
498	Have any of the counterparties on the deals below invoiced us for any of the additional volumes?
499	You think your pretty funny, don't you...
499	Enron North America Corp.
500	Done.
500	Enron North America Corp.
501	Megan, I adjusted deal 529856 on the 2nd of Oct and Nov for the adjustments below.
501	Can you make this work?
501	Enron North America Corp.
502	I don't know anything about the transport either.
502	But, I would assume the rate remains the same.
503	Deal 135714 is active through Oct 2000.
503	The volume on the ticket is zero, so the nom was probably never sent to POPS.
504	Gary Lamphier is working on negotiating a price for this.
505	I have created deal 559843 to cover the flow for Nov 1 thru Jan 31.
505	This deal will probably be handled month-to-month from here on out.
506	I rolled deal 150325 for the first 3 days of Jan. I expect this point to be zero for the rest of Jan.
507	This is a call out meter.
507	I think the best person to help you would be Kathy Benedict in Volume Management.
508	Gary, Have you negotiated a price on this?
509	I extended 454057 for the month of December.
510	Danny, What do you want to do about this?
511	Megan, Please see the message below.
511	The pricing on deal 391125 was incorrect; should be HSC GD-.04.
511	I corrected the deal ticket.
512	I have rolled deal 506192 thru 1/1/01, priced at Dec HSC Index -.045.
513	Mary, How are we looking on the rest of our estimates thru King Ranch?
513	do we need to adjust Big Cowboy or 3 Rivers?
514	Megan, Can you forward your calculations on the Pan Energy swap for September 2000 to me?
514	My contact over there called me regarding some discrepancies beginning that month.
514	I may be able to help reconcile some of this.
515	Can you send me a copy of Pan Energy's spreadsheet for Sept, also?
515	Enron North America Corp.
516	The Texas Desk will not be trading on EOL.
516	We will not have trading or logistics personnel in the office.
516	So don't come in for us.
517	Hey, Ken.
517	Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.
517	We will have a Texas Desk, but I don't really want to continue here.
517	I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp, Paper, Lumber, Steel).
517	I will most likely interview with AEP to see what they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the Evil Empire.
517	I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.
517	Some folks are upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.
517	Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.
517	Cole loved everything.
517	He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to an end.
517	Jake is a little different.
517	We spent $60 on a couple of things for him.
517	He hasn't touched them more than twice.
517	He found his new favorite toy the day after Christmas: it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your lunch in. He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it around everywhere.
517	Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up more room in our already crowded house.
517	We started our house hunting last week.
517	I think this is going to be a long process.
517	Tonya's out looking today.
517	I'm letting her make the first cut.
517	I will come in on the second round.
517	We will probably put our house on the market in a couple of weeks.
517	We have a few small things we want to clean up, fix, etc., before we list it.
517	According to the other sales in the neighborhood, we should make a little money.
517	I hope everything is going well with you and the family.
517	Later.
518	I will not be able to play golf or party.
518	I was really wanting to go, but can't make it.
519	BH, If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend, I would help you out.
519	However, we have a pretty important family weekend coming up.
519	Cole's 3rd birthday is today.
519	We will be doing a little celebrating with that.
519	Plus, we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling appointments to view other houses.
519	Anyway, I hope everything else is going well for you.
519	We need to talk sometime.
519	I will call you in a couple of days.
519	Enron North America Corp.
520	I have adjusted the pricing for the Apache and Williams deals for September forward as we disucussed in the meeting today.
521	Megan, I can meet with you on the Pan Energy Swap anytime Thursday or Friday afternoon.
521	Early afternoon usually works best for me.
521	I can come up to your desk if that is easier.
521	Let me know.
522	Hey, Mom.
522	I got your e-mail just fine.
522	Is your computer fixed up now?
522	Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.
522	When we were walking out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me "Daddy, am I three now?"
522	He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.
522	It took him forever to go to sleep.
522	He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.
522	The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open it before the party.
522	He played it in the car going to the party and on the way home.
522	I think I'm tired of that game.
522	He can't play it in the car anymore.
522	It so funny to watch him play though.
522	He will repeat the question and go "hmm".
522	Anyway I need to go.
523	Sandi, Do you have a complete contract for the Apache purchase under the Tenaska IV deal?
523	Apache is billing us a rate that is $.11 below the commodity rate stated on page 22 in the original contract.
523	In the documents I have, I can't find a reason for the adjustment.
523	I may be missing an amendment or something.
523	I thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could help me out.
523	Daren
524	done.
524	Enron North America Corp.
525	The PanEnergy spreadsheet is attached.
526	Done.
526	Enron North America Corp.
527	Deal has been extended.
528	Lee, I would like to deliver as much of Midcon's gas as possible to Mobil (25,000-30,000) for February.
528	When the work is going on, we can move that around.
528	Also, we have 10,000 baseload on Centana we need to deliver to the plant.
529	Danny will input a new deal for Dec and Jan in the morning.
530	I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think the gas will flow for the month and at what price.
530	I will use your decision for
531	That will be fine.
532	I don't think that we should have any volume on this deal.
532	It seems like Jan 2000 was added after the fact to assist with allocations.
532	But it was later determined that we didn't purchase anything from Copano.
533	You can change the tickets.
533	Thanks.
534	Bob, I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light. The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been left.) Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months: 1) Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas business.
534	2) Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.
534	3) Develop a replacement a.
534	Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and ) b.
534	Hire new person, internally or externally 4) Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.
534	With the new business, we will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.
534	1 and 2 are open-ended.
534	How I accomplish these goals and what they entail will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.
534	I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and possibly more urgent goals will develop.
534	So, in short, who knows what I need to do.
535	Grab me when you get a minute.
535	I have your bonus and merit info.
535	You're going to like it.
536	What are the issues with this?
536	Is the problem a counterparty name issue?
536	Did we pay the wrong company?
536	Is Cleco billing us?
537	I forgot to get with you this morning on this.
537	I went ahead and changed the volume to 24,000.
538	Paul, How are you determining that we should have a buyback for this deal?
538	Enron North America Corp.
539	Sherlyn will correct all the booking when she reallocates the meter.
540	We will need to wait until Janet gets back.
540	This is a spot deal that was done by Gary Lamphier.
540	Did Janet negotiate something with them after the fact?
541	I created deal 602030 under Cleco.
542	To forecast Entex: We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low and high temps for each day.
542	When we get a weather report for the new day, we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.
542	The database is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides an average volume for that criteria.
542	(For example: With temps of 40-60, the sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees. An average is then calculated from that volumetric data. In this case, the average is calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.) Upon calculating the average, we then apply information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.
542	Things to consider: if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry; wind chill; Entex's obligation on Midcon; Entex's recent operating procedures; Entex takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating volumes each day), etc. Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to estimate the remaining 70%.
542	If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates more in line.
542	Let me know if you have any questions.
542	Daren
543	I have created deal #604061 to cover the buyback for 12/27/00.
544	That would be fine.
545	Liz, Do you want to take this on?
546	Heather, I will be leaving today at 1:00.
546	We are buying a house and we have the inspection today.
546	So, if Bob ar anyone needs me they can contact me by pager or mobile phone.
546	Thanks.
547	After speaking with Danny Conner, I have created deal 606396 to cover this meter for the next year.
548	I don't have any open positions.
548	Thanks.
549	I would like to receive the alerts.
550	I have created a spreadsheet to assist in the tracking and booking of the gas supply related to Tenaska IV.
550	If you have suggestions or comments on the file, contact either me or Mark.
550	Megan - You can copy the Jan 01 Est tab and update the volumes with actuals.
550	The file should calculate the resulting settlement with Tenaska.
550	I will then update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month.
550	Since we haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet, we may have to do some tweaking with the formulas.
550	Anyway, this should give us a good start and you will be able to see where we closed the month in Logisitics.
550	The file is located in O/Logistics/Cleburne Plant/2001FuelMgmt.xls.
550	If you don't have access, we can look into creating a new location on the O drive.
550	The spreadsheet is attached for this month.
550	This is definitely a work in progress.
550	So, if you have ideas to make it easier, or if you need something added, let us know.
551	Done.
551	Enron North America Corp.
552	I don't know.
552	Check with Settlements to see if they are billing us for Dec and Jan.
553	Done.
553	Enron North America Corp.
554	I changed the demand to a negative value.
554	I don't know if this will work or not.
554	If it does not work, I can put the demand on the sale ticket.
554	Enron North America Corp.
555	That's cool.
556	Deal 606396 is already in Sitara for Dec 2000-2001.
557	I have done deals with John at this point.
557	Why are we not being allocated any volume?
558	That's fine.
559	Hey Ken.
559	How are things going for you?
559	Is the market loving you?
559	We have been really busy.
559	We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.
559	I don't think I had it underpriced.
559	I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the average.
559	Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were happy.
559	Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in Oaks of Devonshire.
559	It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.
559	It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a great game room/sunroom for the kids.
559	It was built in 86, so it needs a little work.
559	But that's ok with me.
559	Anyway, we are closing on both houses on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.
559	We will have you and Linda over for lunch or dinner one of these days.
559	We also had tubes put into Jake's ears this month.
559	We hated having to do that, but it has really made a difference.
559	He had a constant ear infection since October.
559	Now you can tell that he feels so much better.
559	He's learning more and more each day.
559	We have nothing that is "Jake proof".
559	Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets don't hold him.
559	He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over that it will eventually slip or break and then your in. I'm going to install pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.
559	We'll see if that stops him.
559	Anyway, everybody's doing well.
559	I will be alot better after we finish this house business.
559	I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.
559	Talk to you later.
560	What does ooto mean?
561	I will be out of the office on the afternoon of 2/27 and the majority of the week.
561	March 5-8 is better for me.
562	Mike, I don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery.
562	So, why don't you check with Gas Control to see if they know why vol was delivered on that day.
562	I would think that they had to send someone out there to make it happen.
562	Additionally, you can check with Gary Lamphier or Lee Papyoti to see if they made a deal with the plant.
563	You can extend them, but make sure that the volume is zero.
564	Talk with the person in accounting that deals with Teco.
564	See if they are using a different counterparty now at the plant.
565	Fred, Why is nothing being allocated to Alpine?
565	This is a good deal we have in place with them and I really need the problem resolved.
566	Kim, I can always make time for you...
566	Just grab me sometime after 10:30 Monday morning and we can go over transport.
567	Hey, Byron.
567	We may be interested in your sofa.
567	Send me the pictures when you get a chance.
567	Now that we are moving, we've got a few empty rooms.
567	Thanks.
568	mark, Can you look into this?
568	You may need to check with Mary or Trisha on transport capacity tickets for Dec forward.
569	What are the details on the tv?
569	How old?
569	Problems?
569	Condition?
569	etc. Daren
570	I have created deal # 640357 to cover this flow.
571	High zeros...?
571	Is that similar to going flatter?
572	I extended deal 583232 to cover 2/1 and #604056 to cover 2/6.
573	The new deal should have the same price as the deal that you copied.
574	You need to delete the lines with dates prior to 1/1/01 on the new tickets.
575	We are not interested in the sofa.
575	Thanks.
576	Heather, I will be out a 1/2 day today and a full day on Friday.
576	Also will be out a full day on the 9th.
576	I will be here the rest of the month.
577	You can copy the old tickets or create new ones.
577	What ever you need.
578	done.
579	Rita, Since I was out of the office most of the week, I missed reading this e-mail.
579	I am open any afternoon this week except for Friday (all day) and Bob's staff meeting tomorrow (if we have it).
579	Let me know when you want to meet.
580	The deals you listed are transpurt usage tickets that we use to estimate the cost of transport and the fuel used in the transport.
580	This is just an estimate of what we think Lone Star will bill us under the Tenaska transport contracts (We will pay Lone Star and Tenaska will reimburse us.) Enron North America Corp.
581	I extended deal 559483 through Dec 01.
582	done.
582	Enron North America Corp.
583	Rita, I think that we have the pricing worked out now with the suppiers.
583	There were some ammendments to the contract, reducing the demand charges, that we did not have.
583	I don't have any contacts at Lone Star related to allocations.
583	Mark's scheduling contacts may help.
583	Stacey has a trading contact with the pipeline.
583	When she returns tomorrow, I will have her give you a call.
583	The beginning imbalance on Lone Star was around 180,000 owed to Lone Star when we took on the management services in October.
583	Mark should be able to get you an exact number if you need it.
584	Megan, I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to mtr 25000200.
584	These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.
584	The $.11 that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.
584	I'm not sure about the rates for mtr 20014903.
584	The person who can tell us should be in tomorrow.
584	I will leave a note for her.
584	We should have similar deal tickets for Dec forward.
584	I will check with Mark and Trisha.
584	Enron North America Corp.
585	Eric, I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).
585	He is looking to market LNG in Europe.
585	Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I didn't get much specific information.
585	But, I told him I would find someone for him to talk with.
585	His name is Sam Kovacevich.
585	Phone: 847-971-3369.
585	I would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.
585	If you aren't the person he needs to talk to, please let me know.
585	Thanks.
585	Daren Farmer Texas Desk - Gas
586	FYI
587	I have adjusted deal 452491 for mtr 20014903.
587	We agree with Lone Star's
588	The $.10 rate should be correct.

593	Where are you going?
594	What do you mean "leaving Enron"?
594	Where are you going?
595	Congrats!
595	I've been looking for an explanation for the drop of our stock price.
595	This explains everything.
596	We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).
596	ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb. In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.
596	So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.
596	Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.
597	done.
598	FYI
599	done.
600	Thu, I talked with Lee Papyoti about the Equistar buybacks.
600	I created deal 675086 as an ENA buyback.
600	However, after you have allocated the volume between the Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.
601	FYI
602	Tim, Please forward this to the appropriate person.
602	Scott Berkman with Bruggers Bagels is looking to buy gas delivered to their chain of stores.
602	He mentioned locations in Minn, Iowa, Detroit, Pitt, Cleveland, Boston, and Albany.
602	His phone number is 802-660-4020 ext.

608	Does it have a cover?
609	I created deal 682029.
610	I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG.
610	Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.
610	It has a zero nom.
610	You can send that to POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
610	I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
610	Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.
610	It has a zero nom, also.
611	Briant, I'm not going to be interested.
611	I'm looking for a boat that is a little bigger.
611	Thanks.
612	Gary, Do you have any record of this?
613	Gary, Do you have any record of this?

616	No problem.
616	Enron North America Corp.
617	A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.
617	I don't have a record of a spot deal with them for that day.
617	Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.
617	The price difference on that day is significant.
617	(HSC GD mid was 5.245).
617	If you don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.
618	No problem.

624	Deal 706674
625	Gary, Please call Pat Anderson with Southern Union as soon as possible regarding the info listed below.
625	She wants to work a fixed price swap for 25% of their booked volume for July '01 - Oct '02.
626	You need to path the change at mtr 8055.
626	You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume. All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)
627	Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.
627	Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.
627	However, it's going a lot better this time.
627	I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.
627	With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.
627	We'll see how that goes.
627	Bidweek was kinda rough this time.
627	In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.
627	The line has been split into two seperate systems.
627	Handling that has been a constant battle.
627	Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.
627	It's a little harder to get things done.
627	Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.
627	But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.
627	We are extremely busy.
627	The kids are loving the stairs.
627	You ought to see Jake go down.
627	We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.
627	Well, that was too slow for him.
627	Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.
627	He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.
627	Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.
627	Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.
627	It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.
627	Anyway, I need to get back to work.
627	Hope the family is doing well.
627	Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.
627	I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.
628	March Midcon volumes at Mobil should be 30,000 each day.
628	Any swings should be on the buyback HPL has with Mobil.
629	Julie, You need to keep the nom and confirm at 3000 so that the buyback calculation will work correctly.
630	I don't have any problems with this.
630	Enron North America Corp.
631	I believe the counterparty changed effective 2/1/01 to El Paso Merchant Energy.
631	See deals 637225 and 637234.
632	I don't have any problems with this.
632	Enron North America Corp. From: Victor Lamadrid 04/04/2001 03:19 PM
633	You're in the system now.
633	thanks.
634	I believe that I have received your message in error.
634	My name is Daren Farmer and I work in the Texas gas trading area for Enron.
634	If you will send the name of the person and department you are trying to contact at Enron, I will assist you in communicating with that person.
634	Thanks.
634	Daren Farmer
635	You're in the system now.
635	thanks.
636	The 4429 is good.
637	The 4429 is good.
638	Julie, Howard comes from the volume management area, so I am sure that he knows the best way to handle the Shell buyback.
638	You should path the buyback that Howard set up.
639	Please see the attached spreadsheet related to the EEX supply.
639	Let me know if you have any questions.
640	Ed and Lauri, Jill Zivley is needing bids on various wells from EEX.
640	I understand that anything that is captive to HPL will be going with the pipeline after the sale.
640	So, you should probably quote the bids for any of this supply.
640	I have listed the applicable wells and some limited info in the attached spreadsheet.
640	Eric Boyt is working on the structuring of the deal.
640	He may be contacting you.
640	He would like to get the bids to Jill by Friday.
640	Let me know if you have any questions.
641	Jill wants a quote on the supply.
641	This can be given at the wellhead or at a liquid point (with EEX incurring the transport to get the gas to the liquid point.)
642	I have attached a revised schedule of the EEX deal.
642	I have included our bid price and additional notes for each field.
642	If you will re-print the quote sheets, I will enter our bids on them.
642	Additionally, since we are bidding to buy the gas delivered to the "liquid" areas, please make sure that our agreements with EEX state that the gas must be pipeline quality and must be able to be delivered into the pipes specified on the attached schedule.
642	Let me know if you have any questions.
642	Please view the tab labeled "Bid Pts by bid pt".
643	Cynthia, $4.87 is the correct price for this deal.
643	Waha did not trade above 4.94 on 3/23.
643	This is an EOL deal, so Conoco should be able to easily check their records to confirm this.
644	FYI, Our price quotes have changed from those listed on the e-mail that was sent earlier.
644	Please see the Excel file "EEXBids2" in the O:/_dropboxfolder.
644	Let me know if you have any questions.
645	Done.
646	That's fine.
646	We don't have a deal for this point in the system yet, do we?
647	the deal with TGLO should be handled the same way in March.
648	We recently purchased house with a spa in the backyard.
648	After filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels, the water smells like mildew.
648	Is there a way to treat this chemically?
648	I thought that the smell was coming from the cover at first.
648	But, I have thoroughly cleaned the cover inside and out.
648	Could the smell be coming from the air/water lines?
648	It appears that the previous owners did not take care of some things around the house.
648	Thanks.
648	Daren Farmer
649	Rebecca, TXU is correct on the pricing.
649	I have adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.
650	Ed, I believe that Jill was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale.
650	We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized.
650	The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and Jill was going to present them with bids for their total package (Enron and HPL).
650	Let me know what you want to do.
650	If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.
651	Bob, I have made a few adjustments to the wellhead file, with some comments.
651	Please review the file and make the changes in Sitara today.
651	Let me know if you have any questions or if something changes.
651	Thanks.
651	P.S.
651	How do you like the shading?
652	That's no problem.
653	That's fine.
654	FYI.
655	Go ahead and adjust the deals to bring us in balance.
655	What is the daily flow for the Saxet well now?
656	Done.
656	Deal #749217.
657	Gas Daily Waha is the correct price.
657	I have changed the deal ticket.
658	Thanks!
658	This is very helpful.
659	Don't order any new equipment.
659	George can use the existing equipment in the space next to me.
659	EB3210F.
660	Any deals that were confirmed with Equistar for the first of the month should be kept whole throughout the month.
660	On days where they didn't pull the nom, the buyback goes into effect.
660	Any shortages should be allocated to the buyback tickets.
661	Julie, You need to look at any industrial meter that has buyback and swing deals.
661	Make sure that the base volume is allocated to the base ticket and all other swings go to the other tickets.
662	You can extend the deal for one day.
663	Tess, We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.
663	However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.
663	Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?
663	What did we pay?
663	Let me know this and we can proceed from there.
663	Nelson Ferris did these deals.
663	I will talk to him after I hear from you.
664	Ok, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.
664	But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.
664	Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.
665	On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.
665	However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.
665	This is primarily for spot and base deals.
665	We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.
665	The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).
665	This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).
665	The sale and transport will go with HPL.
665	The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.
665	So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.
665	Let me know if you have any more questions.
666	Julie, I don't have all the deal numbers.
666	You will need to run a report out of CPR, or find the deals in MOPS and review the prices in Sitara.
667	This should not be a problem.
667	They can make it up after the outage.
668	You need to talk to Gary Lamphier and Lee Papayoti.
669	OW, It looks like you changed the pricing in deal 413462 mentioned below.
669	Did Gary or Lee ask you to do this?
670	Eric, The Carthage meters to report on EOL are listed below: Tennessee 4603001 Texas Gas (Firm take away only) 4021021 Reliant 4082006 EPGT Texas Pipeline (PGE Texas) 4615002 There are a couple of meters in the hub, but the capacity is limited.
670	So, we should not list them.
670	Let me know if you have any questions or need additional info.
671	Should I roll the flow to Southern Union at Lockhart at HSC GD + .02 for the days listed below?
672	You are so enthusiastic.
673	Done.
674	Done.
675	Mike, I would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.
675	I spoke with Ed the other day and let him know this.
675	Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.
676	I've got it covered.
677	The price should be 4.955.
677	I have changed Sitara.
678	Tess, I have changed Sitara to agree with the contract.
678	This was changed during flash to get around some pricing errors.
679	You can send your things to 3210F.
679	That is Liz's old desk.
680	These flows are due to the timing of the meter change.
680	So, I have adjusted Sitara to cover the 4th and 7th.
680	Let me know if you have any questions.
681	Hey, man!
681	Well, let me tell you what's' going on.
681	Every evening and every weekend for the last month and a half, I have been painting and working on the house.
681	The previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going (pink in one room and a portion of the entry way, lime sherbet green in the other portion of the entry way).
681	There is a lot of trim, 4 doors, and a 20 ft ceiling in the living room and entry way.
681	So it is taking quite a while to complete.
681	One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking (disposal, toilet flanges, alarm system).
681	In the middle of trying to finish painting, we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile (I got the floors ready, we paid to have the tile laid.).
681	Tonya wants everything done now.
681	It doesn't bother her that I haven't finished a single project since we started the whole renovation thing.
681	But, IT'S KILLING ME!
681	I would like just one finished product.
681	One small room would be fine.
681	The house is looking a lot better, though.
681	I'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids, so I usually start after 8pm each night.
681	Plus, when I do work while the kids are running around I pay a high price.
681	Last week I was painting the baseboards in the dining room, with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor.
681	I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle in the middle of the floor.
681	Jake was coming into the room, watching and climbing up and down the step ladder (6 ft; he climbs to the very top like it's nothing. Other people come in and see him up there and freak out. We just let him go.).
681	He is big into cleaning (guts it from his mom), so when he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up.
681	I told him to "take it to Mama".
681	He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.
681	I just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.
681	Then I noticed out of the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.
681	When I turned to look, I just lost my breath.
681	Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the paint can, pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet.
681	White paint was just pouring off the bottle.
681	It looked like someone had poured paint straight out of the can onto the floor.
681	Thank goodness it was latex, after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up.
681	Cole has helped me with some of the work, such as sanding the walls.
681	But, he carried his work a little farther than I wanted.
681	Yesterday, he had a friend over.
681	They got his tools (play sander/grinder, circular saw, screw drivers), climbed up on his bunk bed, and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling.
681	You should have seen the mess.
681	I am taking a break this weekend though.
681	Cole and I are going camping at Lake Livingston.
681	I am really looking forward to it.
681	I'm trying to start something with him (and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger) where we do a guy thing each month.
681	Last month I took Cole to his first Rockets game.
681	He loved it.
681	They are getting too big, too fast.
681	At work, I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader.
681	I will be getting my own book in a couple of days.
681	I'm pretty nervous about that.
681	There's not a lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here (hard to believe, huh?).
681	But, we'll see how it goes.
681	The last of the HPL/AEP people are moving out of the building tonight.
681	Everything is on course to close the sale on June 1st.
681	Anyway, I hope you and Linda are doing well.
681	We'd like to have you over if we ever get the house in presentable shape.
682	Megan, We did the swap with Pan Energy on 4/28-30 only.
682	On those days, we received all the gas at Carthage, nothing at Castle Busby.
682	When we are not operating under the swap, Duke markets the gas that usually comes in at Castle Busby.
682	Apparently, they sold the gas to Highland in April.
683	There are alot of names on that e-mail.
683	I hope you spread all those Pina Coladas over the week and not drink them all at once.
683	Have fun.
684	I wish we could have purchased that gas at 4.18.
684	But, the correct price is 5.18.
684	I have corrected the deal ticket.
685	I have changed the demand fee.
685	But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams?
685	I don't want to pay Tenaska until we get the money from Williams.
685	Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45,000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45,000/day.
686	Mirant had a problem with an EOL transaction where I bought 5,000 from then at $5.10 for the 1st and 2nd.
686	I agreed to let them out of the deal.
686	Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.
686	The two deals should be netted.
686	We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.
687	Take Liz, Gary, and Earl off the list.
687	Add O'neal Winfee and George Smith.
688	Bob, In looking at the trends over the meters, I made a few adjustments (highlighted in blue).
688	Please use these changes and enter the deal changes in Sitara.
688	Let me know if you have any questions.
689	Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?
689	By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.
689	I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.
690	The price should be IF Waha.
690	I have changed the price in Sitara.
691	See below.
691	The deal was priced at Index but entered as GD in Sitara.
691	This is going to give you a $75,000 hit for April.
692	Use deal 399604.
692	This deal was in Sitara, but did not have the meter attached.
693	OW, On deal 399604 I added meter 3425.
693	There was no meter originally.
694	Done.
695	See if you can find Danny's deal book and verify the price for the deal listed below.
696	The deal has been changed.
697	Sandi, I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.
697	If that has changed, please let me know.
697	I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.
697	As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.
697	Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."
697	This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.
697	ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.
697	Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).
697	The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.
697	How do we get this corrected?
698	Carlos, Is this the gas on Blue Dolphin?
699	Deal 717768 should be kept whole.
699	This is a baseload purchase.
699	Deal 544392 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls.
699	FYI.
699	Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.
699	Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings.
700	Done.
701	Channelview I believe.
701	That's where I put it.
702	I believe that Carlos Rodriguez handles this pipe.
703	Attached is a schedule of Tufoco take for May according to our schedulers.
703	Let me know if you have any questions.
704	We did deliver 30,000 per day to Mobil for Midcon for the month of May.
705	Done.
706	Elizabeth, Can you re-send the file with the attachement?
706	I accidentally deleted the first message and I don't have access to the file online.
707	Its working.
707	I love you alot.
708	Thanks.
708	The fax we received from the plant reported the start up at 11:00am, reaching full capacity at 1:00pm.
708	But, we shouldn't have a problem.
709	Bryce, Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.
709	I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.
709	Why were these deals actualized to zero?
710	Done.
711	Megan, I have created deal # 1075281 to cover a sale from Cleburne to ENA.
711	I also repathed Unify.
711	This should clean up the UA4 after the actuals on the old path between Deal 384237 and 502861 are zeroed out.
711	Let me know if you have any questions.
712	Annette, The transport statement we received from Lone Star did not show that this gas flowed.
712	That is why we have not paid yet.
712	We are in discussions with the pipe to find out what happened.
712	I will let you know as soon as something is determined.
713	The supply from the desk-to-desk transaction (#1075281) is pathed to the transport.
713	The 1023 contract is an ENA agreement.
713	So, deal 1075281 transfers the gas to ENA.
713	ENA then transports the gas on it's agreement on Lone Star.
714	Becky, Please change my e-mail address on your distribution list to : dfarmer70@houston.rr.com.
714	Thanks.
715	I don't have anyone.
716	Can you look into this?
717	I never doubted you.
717	Thanks.
718	How does your afternoon look on Tuesday?
718	I'm thinking around 2:00.
719	Tuesday, around 2pm works for me and the Texas group.
720	Hey Sweet Baby!
720	I was just thinking of you.
720	I love you.
721	done.
722	We did not sell to TGL for Sept.
723	Where do you think you're going?
723	I don't know if I can handle any changes in deal validation.
724	I didn't know if you got this or not.
724	I love you.
724	I can't wait to spend the next week with you.
724	Me
725	I'm in.
726	Elizabeth, Texas and Wellhead were grouped under George.
726	I adjusted Texas, but not Wellhead.
726	I also added the market hubs that we trade, under the pipeline section.
726	Let me know if you have any questions.
727	done.
728	The revised weekend nom is attached.
728	Have a good weekend.
729	Just wanted to let ya'll know that we get the attached report each week from Vol Mgmt.
729	We don't have any pending issues (we haven't had many since this started), which I like to see.
729	Thanks for staying on top of it all.
730	Mike Olsen will be the critical user for Texas.
731	FYI.
732	I believe that we did have some activity on Blue Dolphin, but it was done by the Wellhead group.
732	You should send the Vol Mgmt people to George Smith.
733	I know the following: 1) Gulf Plains plant is in Nueces County.
733	2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County.
733	Check with George to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.
733	I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.
733	For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.
734	The entity I trade with is TXU Gas Distribution.
734	I verified this with my contact this morning.
734	So, deal 1085609 is correct.
735	All of the Exxon Katy points are in Waller County, Tx.
736	Hey, Man.
736	Can you fix the schedule so that I can play somebody this week?
737	Done,.
738	Hey, Ken.
738	We are in sad shape, aren't we?
738	I was on vacation last week, through Monday.
738	Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and an SEC inquiry.
738	It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be here.
738	Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.
738	Things really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.
738	I actually started talking to them about it.
738	But on Wednesday, they made a few changes that I'm not so sure about.
738	Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over the origination desk.
738	(I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and Bilberry.) With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading desk.
738	That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.
738	That blew me away.
738	I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the financial risk.
738	Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbus.
738	He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.
738	So, this may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the famThe home-life is going well.
738	We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.
738	My lovely wife signed me up to be the coach.
738	I'm going to get her for that one.
738	It is fun, though.
738	Those kids are funny.
738	They don't care where the ball goes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).
738	Looking forward to Halloween.
738	Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/prisoner.
738	Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.
738	My vacation last week was very good.
738	It was the first extended vacation that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff planned.
738	It was one of the best vacations I have had.
738	We spent 2 days in San Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.
738	The rest of the week, we did things around here (like Children's Museum).
738	Big game coming up this weekend.
738	Do you think your Huskers can pull it off?
738	I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.
738	How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?
738	Later.
739	Please take care of this.
740	I don't know of any days yet.
741	I've been trying to call ya'll.
741	Both lines.
741	One keeps ringing.
741	The other one gives a busy signal sometimes, keeps ringing sometimes.
741	Is the answering machine not hooked up?
741	Or are ya'll not clicking over?
741	Anyway.
741	We're doing fine.
741	Just wanted to let you know that I tried to call.
742	Isn't the deal pathed from Exxon King Ranch (Deal 210722) to Reliant?
743	Megan, We didn't operate HPL in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies.
743	The supply for these sales was the entire HPL system.
743	You can calculate the WACOG on HPL as an estimated cost for each day or month.
743	But I can't give you a specific supply cost or deal.
743	Let me know if you have any questions.
744	Gas Logistics: Mike Olsen Jay Smith Laura Vuittonet has all of their info.
745	We had to get the gas from somewhere.
745	Did Tejas owe HPL gas and make the delivery to settle an imbalance?
745	It looks like ENA transported the gas on Tejas for Feb. Have you checked to see if ENA transported on Tejas for Mar?
746	Hey Cliff, Which Rogue Spear do you have?
747	I have created deal 1150179 to cover this supply.
747	Mike - Please see that this gets pathed in MOPS and POPS and let Megan know when completed.
747	Thanks.
748	OW, What do you think about the orig deduct?
748	How do we usually handle orig on something like this?
749	For.
750	No changes.
751	FYI
752	Karen, Mike Olsen currently reports to me.
752	I fully recommend Mike as a candidate for the Origination Track.
752	I don't think that he has decided which path he wants to take regarding his future, but I know that he would be very interested in discussing this track.
752	Please contact him at your convenience.
752	Thanks.

754	None.
755	hey Ken, Let's do lunch next week.
755	We are moving into the new building this weekend.
755	I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).
755	We had a tough football weekend.
755	It's about time we got beat.
755	We didn't deserve the wins we had.
755	Anyway, I've got to get to work.
755	Trying to break $12.00 today.
755	It's kind of odd...moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...
756	Done.
757	ENE @ 9.90?
757	I don't think I will be able to eat for a week.
757	Maybe you should bring a bullet next week and put me out of my misery.
758	FYI.
758	I set you up as our man.
758	There is nothing that you have to do.
758	I basically just reserved a second desk, computer, etc for us in this building in the case that we have problems with the move.
759	Who does Tanya Smith report to?
759	What will she be doing?
760	none
761	Rita, I began digging further into how this was scheduled yesterday.
761	It does not look very good.
761	I will re-work it today and let you know when I'm done.
762	Are you still there?
763	Done.
764	Mike, I very much appreciate what you have done for our desk.
764	Let me look into the promotions within and out of the analyst program.
764	I want to take the best option possible.
765	Let's og today if you can, or tomorrow.
765	I'm available anytime after 11:00.
765	Are you going to try your badge again?
765	They are reviewing the photos now, along with new scanners.
766	We are in the same building.
766	The move got postponed until next week.
766	Using the same badges.
766	I have the same phone #.
766	Parking is the same.
766	I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.
766	Whew...I think I covered everything.
766	See you in a little while.
767	Rita, In order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).
767	I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.
767	From what I understand, we received the gas at King Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.
767	Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.
767	With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.
767	Let me know if you need me to do anything else.
768	I really like you Eric and would like to spend some time learning how you are such a master of basis trading.
769	Have you seen this?
770	Bob, Mike Olsen - Analyst 1 Jay Smith - Specialist 3 Let me know if you need explanations.
771	Yes
772	Mike olsen will be coming in for the Texas desk.
773	Hey baby, honey-bun, goodlookin, goodlovin, sexy sweet thang!
773	We may need to start talking to Byron or someone about investing and all of that.
773	Can you find out how much he charges, one visit and continuing?
773	he sent out an e-mail about ira's.
773	they are waving fees for those for lifetime thru 12/31/01.
773	Anyway, I love you.
774	This ticket starts with 7/99 production.
774	How were all of the other months paid?
775	none for me
776	I can go any of the 1st 3 weeks of Dec.
777	he doesn't have to go if you will wear the horns and play the buck like he does.
778	Anthony, Can you change the counterparty name on deal 93836 to Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc.?
779	none
780	Hey, Ken We had a good holiday.
780	Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.
780	Last night it took 12.
780	Other than that everything was good.
780	Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).
780	Watched a little football.
780	Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.
780	I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.
780	And the OU game...I love college football.
780	It is so much more exciting than the pros.
780	Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.
780	The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.
780	I think that we are close to the end.
780	Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.
780	So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?
780	20 footer?
780	We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.
780	Jake doesn't know what's going on.
780	But, Cole is all excited.
780	Everything he sees, he wants for "Chrimsas".
780	Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.
780	We'll see how it goes.
780	I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.
781	A preliminary copy of the Cleburne activity for Oct 2001 is attached.
781	Mike will be in tomorrow, and will finalize it.
782	Anthony, Can you take care of this?
783	I sent an e-mail to anthony campos on the 19th asking him to change the counterparty.
783	I don't have the access to do that.
783	If he can change the name, then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path.
783	I just sent him another message today.
784	I just found out that Anthony has changed responsibilities.
784	He said that he forwarded the message to Bridgett ?.
784	I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.
785	Have you taken care of this?
786	I'm here.
786	but barely.
786	last couple of days we've just been battleing problems and putting out fires.
786	hanging in though.
786	this just seems so unreal.
786	i can't believe we are doing this.
786	personally, i've got options, so i'm not too worried.
787	done.
788	Well, I'm here.
788	We are not trading.
788	Actually, we are just hanging around, playing games and shooting the breeze, waiting for the next news story.
788	It's really odd.
788	It really is sad seeing all the layoffs.
788	Especially, when I think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living.
788	Anyway, things are fine for me and the family.
788	I'd better go.
788	We've got a crossword competition starting.
789	Bob, We have the following net-outs in place at the Exxon Katy Plant: Texas Energy Transfer As for contracts we will need as a new company: IT transport (intrastate and interstate) on the following pipes: TXU Lone Star Oasis Channel East Texas Gas Systems (ETXG) Duke Guadalupe Park and Lend contract on EPGT.
789	Hub (or wheeling) contracts on EPGT and ETXG.
789	Let me know if you have any questions.
790	done.
791	What's the big deal?
791	It's only one digit...But, if it will make you happy, I will fix it.
792	where are you going?
793	I'm sure that the Panenergy deal is all yours.
793	I definitely understand your concerns.
793	Good luck over there.
794	Home: 281-288-8251 Cell: 281-503-8732 Cell will be the best way to contact me.
794	I will be out Thurs and Fri of this week.
795	Jeff, I left a voice mail message for you yesterday about our role as agents for the Tenaska IV's Cleburne plant.
795	I wanted to make sure that you got the message.
795	Please give me a call when you get a chance (3-6905).
796	Mike - here you go.
796	You might as well bridge back the pipes now and be done with it.
796	Let me know when you start this and I will help if you want me to.
797	done.
798	Hey Ken.
798	Well, I'm still here for now.
798	It's hard to leave.
798	We have all taken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the week before that.) I'll only be here a couple of hours today.
798	But we had a great Christmas.
798	The kids have been so excited.
798	I made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.
798	You can hear them all through our neighborhood.
798	The neighbors have already asked my what I was thinking.
798	Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buzz Lightyear).
798	He got them all.
798	With each present, he kept getting louder and more excited.
798	Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he didn't care what was in them.
798	That kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.
798	In fact, the other day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.
798	Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.
798	So, he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being about eight feet tall).
798	Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it.
798	After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.
798	You should have seen his eyes light up.
798	You would have thought it was the biggest event of the year.
798	He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."
798	It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.
798	My mom and sister came in the weekend before Christmas.
798	Tonya's parents and sister came in Friday.
798	With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downstairs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).
798	That was my first try with crown molding.
798	It turned out ok.
798	Thank the Lord for wood putty.
798	So, we've been pretty busy.
798	But, it's been fun.
798	How was your Christmas?
798	Was Santa Claus good to you?
798	I guess your kids were in. I hope you had a wonderful time.
798	I'm looking forward to Corn Boys bowl game.
798	Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.
798	Tonya's dad and I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.
798	It doesn't make much sense, does it?
798	But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.
798	Later, Daren
799	Bob, For the Texas Desk, Mike Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.
799	As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.
799	We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.
799	Trading primarily on the Waha, Katy , and Carthage hubs.
799	I will cover Katy and Carthage.
799	Mike will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.
799	I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).
799	What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?
799	Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have Brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002?
799	Thanks.
800	Bob.
800	I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier.
800	But I can't find it in my e-mail anywhere, so here it is: Highest Priority El Paso Gas Transmission Texas Pipeline (formerly PGE Texas and Valero) Hub contract, Park & Lend contracts, inter- and intrastate transport East Texas Gas Transmission (Duke Energy Field Services) Cartwheel agreement, transport Secondary Priority Guadalupe Pipeline (Duke Energy Field Services) Intra- and interstate transport TXU Gas Distribution (Lone Star Pipeline) " " " " El Paso Field Services Channel " " " " Tejas Pipeline The contracts on the pipes listed under "Highest Priority" are required for us to trade in the 3 main areas in Texas (EOL).
800	We must have these on day one.
800	The secondary contracts/pipes will be used soon after start up and are ranked in order of importance.
800	Please let me know if you have any questions.
800	Again, I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago.
800	Sorry for the delay.
801	Bob, Tom is asking aobut the budget info.
801	When do you think that I can get it?
802	We may be able to print this out
803	look on the texas tab
804	This is what we've got so far.
804	Due to our agency activity on Lone Star, I do not want to contact them yet.
804	But, I have a copy of a contract they sent me a couple of months ago we can use.
805	Bobby, Unfortunately, we will not be able to make it Saturday night.
805	We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife, sort of a late Christmas get together.
805	I hate that we are going to miss it, but I will touch base with you later.
805	Also, please change the e-mail addresses you have for me and Tonya to: dfarmer70@houston.rr.com and tjfarmer@houston.rr.com Thanks.
805	Daren
806	Bob, Who is collecting the hard copies or e-mails of contracts?
806	I've got the Guadalupe contracts now.
807	Suzanne, Below are the contracts we will need to ship on Guadalupe Pipeline in Texas.
808	Jeff, The message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.
808	We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.
808	In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.
808	In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines. All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska. ENA receives a management fee).
808	Can we pay intercompany bills?
808	How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?
808	Daren
809	James, I just sent a message to Jeff Hodge asking how we can handle this.
809	I will let you know as soon as I hear something from him.
809	(I left messages with him prior to today to discuss this deal.)
810	OW, I went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves/mapping we can delete (yellow) and those we can change (orange).
810	The only curves we will have left are Katy, Waha, HSC, Agua Dulce, and Thompsonville.
810	I expect to be using Thompsonville in 6 months to a year.
810	If it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it, that will be fine.
810	Let me know if you have any questions.
811	Chris, What credit requirements to you have for a new entity with an "A" credit rating?
811	Daren
812	Jeff, I will be happy to meet with you on Wednesday.
813	Physically...yes.
813	Mentally...I've been gone a long time.
813	I'm trying to make a decision whether to stay or go.
813	How about you?
813	How are things going?
814	Rick, We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.
814	1) Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.
814	We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.
814	This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.
814	As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.
814	We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).
814	In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.
814	For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.
814	2) For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.
814	However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.
814	ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.
814	James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.
814	I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan. We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.
814	I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.
814	But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.
814	Please give me a call or e-mail me.
814	We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.
815	Contract from Oasis Pipe Line.
816	Suzanne, Attached is an updated file on our pipeline contract situation.
816	I haven't gotten much info from credit managers, but I wanted to pass along their names and numbers.
817	Bob, I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen.
817	Mike has been instrumental to the Texas Desk.
817	With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience.
817	Mike took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling).
817	He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the Katy Hub.
817	Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.
817	Mike used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions.
817	Since June, Mike has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe).
817	Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.
817	In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub).
817	Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts.
817	In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.
817	Mike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business.
817	With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading.
817	Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading.
817	Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilities.
817	He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member.
817	Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.
817	Mike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects.
817	He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations.
817	He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen.
817	In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him.
817	In short, Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.
817	His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals.
817	Mike is a superior employee.
817	His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk.
817	Please support him with a promotion.
817	Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.Thanks.
817	Daren
818	Rick, I've had a couple of meetings today.
818	I'm sorry I'm just getting back to you.
818	I tried to call but the voice mail said that you were unavailable.
818	So, give me a call when you get a chance.
819	Ed, ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.
819	Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.
819	This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.
819	In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.
819	Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.
819	ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.
819	Rick Hill is my contact person for the project.
819	He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.
819	If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.
819	The problem with Enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).
819	So, the project is losing value.
819	Please give me a call when you get a chance.
819	Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.
819	My schedule is pretty flexible.
819	Daren
820	Can have a cake with rough blue icing on top (seas) and find a pirate ship to put on top.
820	get a bunch of blue balloons (ocean) to put around pirate ships.
821	Hey, Derrick Thanks for the golf journal.
821	I'm looking forward to using it.
821	I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.
821	Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.
821	I know the tips will help me.
821	Keeping notes is good idea also.
821	Thanks, also for the golf towel.
821	I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.
821	Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.
821	If I play like the last time (when David and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.
821	Anyway, I hope you are doing well.

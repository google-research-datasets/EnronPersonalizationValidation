1	The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.
1	Let me know if you need any thing else.
2	I believe this contract has been executed - Kenton was the lawyer working w Paul P. Let me know if you need us to track it down.
2	Give me a call anytime to discuss the industry in genreal
3	Sheila I may have mispoke - I thought you were talking about the power contracts.
3	I don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w financings, but I could be wrong.
3	let me know what else I can do.
4	not a thing yet
5	Kenton worked on this contracr - do you think you can find this.

11	Thanks Elizabeth Sager Enron
12	Jeff FYI
13	John I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.
13	This is the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC concerns.
13	Let me know whats next.
14	John I'm not in on Friday so is there another day?
14	Also without wantingto be too bold, I will say that we have been down this path before and we just can't have a preestablished termination right (unless it is a Default) with financial payment.

29	Thanks and I hope all is well.
29	Elizabeth
30	"A long time to wait" - thats what Ella says all the time, only she's usually wrong and you are definitely right.
30	In the process of becoming dedicated to nothing but dispute resolution it appears I've lost my civility ....
30	imaging that .....
30	becoming just like so many trial lawyers.
30	How about Monday the 12th?
30	Sager
31	Hi Geoff Sorry for the long delay - Things have been unbelievably hectic.

31	Elizabeth
32	Here is a draft of where we are thinking of going with WSPP Firm.
32	Give me a call to discuss.
32	Thanks.
32	Elizabeth 713 853 6349.
33	Attached is a first draft.
33	It is likely heavy handed but we can chop down from here (don't want to scare NERC away but need to set the record straight).
34	Hi Geoff Give me a call at 713 853-6349 when you get a chance.
34	I'v beend trying to call you today but the number just keeps on ringing.
34	Hope all is well.
34	Talk to you soon.
34	Thanks Elizabeth
35	Brenda Will you please print these out for me.
35	Thanks
36	Please print
37	Mark FYI regarding Jim's new role.
37	Thanks Elizabeth
38	FYI Have a great day
39	Privileged and Confidential.
39	Attoney Client Work Product.
39	Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.
39	Our outside counsel believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP because we know TVA will reject it.
39	Sending this letter is not critical to the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.
39	Before deceiding to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, re acces to transmission through third party transactions.
39	Lets discuss this afternoon.
39	Thanks Elizabeth
40	Hi Dennis called me to attempt to reschedule.
40	Conflicts in schedules led him to leave me a vm saying he will call me when he gaets back in the office next week.
40	I'll keep you posted.
41	Thanks for your email.
41	I'll be out of the office for the rest of the week so when you find an answer, just let Bonnie (37422) White know.
41	Thanks.
41	Elizabeth
42	FYI - I'm out of the office the rest of this week, in on Monday and then out all the following week.
42	My assistant Brenda knows where I am.
42	If you need to reach me either leave me a vm and I'll return the call (I would love nothing more than to be execused from the painful standardized contract meetings I will be attending) or else call me on the cell phone 713 854 5747.
42	Bob Madden is the outside lawyer on the TVA MOPA and control area and you can call him at 713 650 8805 if you need to.
42	He is currently working on the declaratory judgement petition and is aware of the possible timeframe.
42	Have a great week.

44	Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California to continue the slow and steady march towards a standardized, "national" agreement.
44	Schedule C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the following is a summary of where the group is headed.
44	After much discussion, we proposed that the group consider the definition of firm energy that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.
44	The following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP group is currently reviewing: Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.
44	Seller shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under this definition.
44	Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the "optics" are necessary to help traditional utilities).
44	As a further note, the group agreed to do away with all references to C1 and C2 and have just one Schedule.
44	Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where the result of the following discussions: 1.
44	Generated vs. Sold - "Sold" was elected over "generated" because the group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the generator's reserve requirements.
44	2.
44	"Schedule" was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.
44	3.
44	"Reserves" instead of "Operating Reserves" was used because the group thought the word operating may be too restrictive.
44	4.
44	"WSCC reserve requirements" was replaced with "applicable" reserve requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in scope and should not be limited to WSPP.
44	5.
44	References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was excluded because the group thought it was redundent - no control area would accept a non-firm supply as being firm.
44	6.
44	Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision that has already been made.
44	This defintion will be further discussed at the next meeting on Aug 20th in Denver.
44	Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.
44	I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
44	Thanks.
44	Elizabeth
45	I'm available all day on the 23rd and 24th.

65	FYI - Brochure for EEI meeting in November.
66	Here is the draft.
66	As always, thanks for your help.
66	Elizabeth
67	Hi Christian Thanks for the email and voicemail - look forward to seeing you in Oct. This EEI contract is a still a progress in work.
67	Last week's meeting resulted in still more changes.
67	New draft is being prepared and will be distributed later this week.
67	Contract "rollout" is in Nov. Its raining here.
67	First time in over two months.
67	I think I'll leave today in celebration.
67	Sager
68	I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to recommence the project we began in January to review the existing Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.
68	All of you should have received a black binder labelled "Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas Forms" which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, assignement, confidentiality ....).
68	If you did not receive or cannot locate this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.
68	This analysis was done in January.
68	I am aware that some of the forms may have changed since then but have not undertaken to "update" the memo as we will be able to discuss such changes at the meeting.
68	The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based trading forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.
68	The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's "model" trading provisions should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.
68	With this in mind, I would hope to be able to create a "modular type" contract whereby each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language that will be approved by the group.
68	By way of example, Enron's gas contract prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any reason.
68	The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably withhold its consent.
68	At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.
68	This "modular assignment section" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.
68	You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas of a trading contract.
68	Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with other provisions such as credit terms.
68	At the meeting, I hope to further discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.
68	Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to assist us in this effort.
68	Thanks
69	call in number is 888 237 7001, access code 501 104 talk to you later
70	Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; only my "enemies" get to hear or see me.

86	Article as per my voice mail.
86	Thanks Elizabeth
87	FYI
88	per my vm es
89	hi
90	Thank you
91	Christi Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would like more information (Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect confidentiality - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties) *EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.
91	Judge Edgar has been assigned the matter.
91	*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA). *The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery. EPMI believes that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue. *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set. *EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.
92	As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a manner similiar to other control areas.
92	One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against TVA for TVA's breach of NERC policies.
92	In order to make such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC policies are a "contract" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.
92	One concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other, unrelated proceedings if it was determined that NERC policies were indeed "contractual obligations" (e.g., a third party claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC "contractual policies").
92	It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me with any thoughts or comments you have.
92	Thanks for your help.
92	Elizabeth CONFIDENTIAL;ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT;NOT DISCOVERABLE
93	Patty and Harlan I received your emails.
93	1.
93	I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions.
93	2.
93	I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point.
93	3.
93	My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO definition.
93	I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday.
93	If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise given current work committments.
93	I will let you know by Thursday afternoon if it looks like earlier is doable.
93	Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
93	Thanks Elizabeth
94	Into product should be distributed to Andy and Patricia Young.
94	Emails in this email
95	Draft Definitions should go to all the peole on this email both as "to" and "cc".
96	Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product description meeting on Wed.
96	I would guess that the bulk of the meeting will be spent on the "Into" definition, which draft was prepared by David and myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other product definitions (unit firm and system firm).
96	If you have any questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me.
97	Hi Dede Dana Davis is the trader that is coming from Enron.
97	Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
97	Elizabeth
98	Richard Here is where Genia got on fax room search.
98	Lets's talk tommorrow about where to go from here.
98	Thanks
99	As you requested, attached as "INTO4R" is a draft defintion of an INTO Product that I prepared for EEI.
100	Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension of deliveries under the MOPA.
100	Please review and call me with any questions or comments.
100	We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide energy under the MOPA at market based rates.
100	As you are aware, the current plan is to send TVA notice on Jan. 4th.
100	The draft of the control area petition should be ready for circulation on Tuesday, the 28th.
100	Once received, I will forward both the petition and a revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review.
101	please print all
102	please print
103	please print both
104	Andy David Portz and I will be available to attend the meeting in DC.
104	Look forward to seeing you then.
104	Happy New Year Elizabeth
105	Hi Give me a call about Duke's changes.
105	I also disagree w (ii) and really think even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against other Gains and Losses.
105	Happy New Year
106	On?
106	Name the time (400?) and the spot (Met?)
107	At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.
107	As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.
107	At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.
107	Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA.
107	The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.
107	This proposal is conditioned on TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA pending the judicial proceedings.
107	If you have any questions, please call me at 36349.
108	Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, including power deals, that were closed last year.
108	Background information on the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be administered by power trading.
108	Let LindaNoske know if you can make it (lunch will be served)
109	ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or is contemplating taking relating to TVA: Jan 6 - MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event occurred and asking TVA to consider our proposal in order to continue the MOPA in effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Jan 27 and terminating the MOPA by selecting an Early Termination Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of notice) Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint relating to TVA's actions against EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of Tenn. (Judge Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface issues If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me immediately.
109	Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.
109	If we move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody, Elizabeth Sager

120	What time
121	ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected EPMI's offer to continue performance under the MOPA at market prices.
121	Accordingly, we sent a letter to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.
121	Please call me if you have any questions.
121	Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.

131	I will keep you informed as the deal progresses.
131	Thanks Elizabeth
132	nothing I know of
133	Tuesday works great for me.
133	As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet finished, revisions to Product B. I have several questions and will need input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.
133	I spoke w Harlan briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the "one-time, good faith effort" to find an ADI.
133	I will call Harlan and Marjie to further discuss.
133	A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.
133	Thanks Elizabeth
134	Today its my turn to be the goof - today I can't make it.
134	Sorry.
134	How about tomorrow Sager
135	I did say Thursday right?
135	Thursday noon?
136	brenda please set up in mydirectory as the next TVA letter
137	Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show changes from Fred's last draft.
137	The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding; references to the proposal being held "open" have been deleted.
137	Also, I have not attempted to include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).
137	Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of "Green Requirement".
137	Fred - I wanted to stick to "would" instead of "will" as the operative verb in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal.
137	If you have any questions or comments, please call me.
137	I will not be in the office on Friday.
137	In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.
137	Elizabeth
138	Fred I don't think we have to wait, but if time permits we might as well fix.
138	Elizabeth
139	Christi Could you please email the TVA draft letter.
139	Thanks If I don't talk to you before you leave, have a great trip.
140	positively - how about early monday?
140	take care Elizabeth
141	At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's response to TVA's recent letter concerning EPMI's transmission requests.
141	This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from Kevin and me.
141	I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all revisions have been made.
141	Please let me know if you have any comments.
141	We would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this afternoon if possible Thanks Elizabeth
142	Andy As we discussed during the last conference call, attached is a revised Article 8, Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised section for the Cover Page.
142	The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed to during the conference call.
142	I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes.
142	Maybe you will have better success.
142	I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.
142	The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows: 1.
142	Changed the Section entitled "Performance Assurance" to "Collateral Threshold" - Use of PA seemed misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral.
142	2.
142	Added the words "acceptable to Party ___" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a) that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party.
142	3.
142	Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are "Applicable" or "Not Applicable".
142	As always thanks for your help.
142	Elizabeth
143	Thanks
144	this would not print for me.
144	would you try
145	fyi lets discuss later
146	please call me w any final comments
147	A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains "substantive" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the "deemed accepted" language.
147	I have been very vocal against adding this language.
147	The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much of successful politics, dirty.
147	I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner).
147	I will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote.
148	Let me know if there is anything else I can do Thanks Sager
149	Enron votes no.
149	Thanks Elizabeth Sager
150	In what I'm sure is an oversight, EEI forgtot to send me a ballot.
150	After appealing for my right to vote, a ballot was forthcoming.
150	I voted "NO" on the proposal.
150	We will see what happens from here.
151	tva letter w presto change (generator to generation) and fixed typo
152	letter w presto changes and 1 typo ( see earlier email)

166	I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait" (on hard floors) .
166	Any advice?
166	Your experience certainly must have been better.
166	Sad I am.
167	Dear Gail wants a party at a house.

167	Gail said kids or no kids, whatever we wanted.

167	Punt to Ted w/no kids?
168	Tuesday, GAD's only birthday request was for an "old-timey" chocolate cake" (the kind that's not very good but she likes anyway). Today, on reflection, she asked for oysters. Grant's special ones. All my hard work and you get the fame.
169	another request - delegate as you feel appropriate thanks
170	I hope so.
170	GIve me a call sometime.
170	I could have lunch today, the 28th.

175	Hi Dede I got your email about NY seminar.
175	Great idea but sorry we can't be of much help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.
175	I know its time to start trying to use it.
175	Oh well, next week's project.
175	On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) at lunch?
175	Let me know.
175	Hope you have fun on Friday night.
175	Elizabeth
176	As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.
176	This agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.
176	Call me at 713 853 6349 if you have any questions or comments.
176	Thanks Elizabeth Sager
177	John I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.
177	I will be out of the office March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.
177	When you get the draft contract, please forward it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.
177	Depending upon the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer will be able to help you with this.
177	The timing may be awkward because all Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.
177	Once I see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.
177	Talk to you soon Elizabeth
178	Hi John Thanks for the email re TVA.
178	As usual, things got behind me last week so I wasn't able to move the TVA letter forward.
178	I have promised Kevin something by today - so I may be calling you this afternoon.
178	Hope all is well Elizabeth
179	Hi Dede Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a roller-coaster of an airplane for over 5 hours fighting a "terrific headwind" according to the pilot.
179	See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.
179	Elizabeth
180	As promised.
180	Call me when you want to disucss.
180	FYI - The letter is very "lawyerly"; I'm not sure this is the right approach though.
180	Let me know if you think this tone will do more harm than good.
180	Paragraphs for you to consider are in brackets.
181	Hi Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.
181	On Friday, after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.
181	I thought I could do it too.
181	I was playing like a spring chicken until my first big overhead.
181	I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over Grant's head.
181	I thought I was so cool.
181	Up I went to find the ball and out came flying my racquet.
181	On the other side of the net.
181	Cracked.
181	Everybody stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a mess.
181	I think I better work on that shot.
181	Tennis on Wed.?
181	Elizabeth
182	There is no guarantor for NHEC.
182	I have not received the form of LC.
182	Issuing bank is National Rural Utility Coop Finance Corp. Thanks Elizabeth
183	Sounds great.
183	See you on Wed.
183	at 1230 unless I hear from you.
184	thanks
185	good for us
186	Oops forgot to respond to this request.
186	It would be absolutely fine to use our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.
186	My only suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten untold grief for using HOUSTON).
186	See ya at 1230
187	thanks
188	I would love them if still available
189	Robbi Sometime on Wed, Thurs.
189	next week would be fine to get together (I'm out early next week doing the last of the roadshows on the Edison contract - I can't wait for the process to be over - it has been going on for over a year).
189	Call my assiatant Brenda Whitehead at 35438 to schedule a time.
189	Thanks Elizabeth

192	Talk to you soon Elizabeth
193	how about 330?
194	Instructions per SW.
194	I assume she is referring to the time submitted by Taffy.
194	Jeff H is my immediate supervisor.
194	Thanks
195	Chaundra must have accidently forgot to forward to you.
196	Hi How about Tuesday at 1130 ( I'm meeting with all Enron power traders on Tuesday at 400 to explain the EEI contract - oh boy, that will be a blast).
196	If that doesn't work I can also play on Wed.
196	See ya
197	She'll love it!
197	Talk to you soon.
197	Have a great weekend.
198	Hi Brent Hope all is well.
198	I received your email.
198	In the US we do physical power puts and calls, usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).
198	The confirmation for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all the other general terms and conditions.
198	By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.
198	Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston (Thanks Leslie)
199	Lisa Thanks for the notice.
199	Please add Janice Moore and Shari Stack to you list and delete Lou Stoler.
199	Thanks Elizabeth
200	You both have been added to this list

204	The week you are in BI may work out great.
204	We will get back in touch with you as soon as we check the details.

204	Liz
205	Oops.

206	David Can you look this over.
206	Thanks
207	Tues at 930 or 200 would be fine.
207	thanks

210	Janice You could help Christi et all on this Thanks Elizabeth
211	David Could you please look at this?
211	Thanks Elizabeth
212	Hi John Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual interconnect with Southern.
212	In the next week or so we will give them a call.
212	On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.
212	Maybe this is a thawing of relations.
212	Just dreaming.
212	Talk to you soon.
212	Hope all is well.
212	Elizabeth
213	Please print attachment and send copies to Richard Sanders, Mark Haedicke and Bob Madden.
213	Thanks
214	tues sounds great
215	Leslie Can you please forward to the appropriate person
216	Can you print this?
217	Brenda Please turn this into a draft in my TVA letter file.
217	We will work on later this later today.
217	thanks
218	Please review.
218	If OK I will send down for signature.

219	Some interesting background materials
220	per my vm by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 06/08/2000 08:49 AM -----
221	At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an "Into Product" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (this definition is also available on the EEI web page).
221	The only other definition of an "Into" product of which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page or the definition published by NYMEX for its "Into Entergy" product.
221	If you have any questions about the "Into" energy product that is so commonly traded in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg "Into Entergy", "Into TVA", "Into Cinergy", "Into ComEd"), please don't hesitate to call me.
221	Elizabeth Sager Enron Power Marketing, Inc. Assistant General Counsel - Power Trading
222	Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable Hi Tim Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA.
222	PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.
222	At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.
222	On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.
222	After netting all these amounts, there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.
222	Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).
222	Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000 PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors, we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you.
222	Call me if you have any questions.
222	Thanks Elizabeth
223	This is another TVA letter.
223	Can you please put in my directory, add our standard addresses and heading and set up for signature for Kevin Presto VP .
223	I will work on editing letter after you fix format.
223	thanks
224	Hi Cregg Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.
224	Good luck to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better opportunity will present itself.
224	Elizabeth
225	Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship between TVA transmission and marketing.
225	N I will call you later to discuss TVA letter.
225	Kevin does not want to make offer to sell at market based rates.
225	Also want to discuss if there is any way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.
225	Talk to you soon.
225	Thanks
226	Bob Here is a revised draft.
226	Please review and give me comments.
226	Thanks Elizabeth
227	Tennis plan looks great.
227	Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.
227	No problem.
227	I played last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random....
227	in a word, pitiful.
227	So here is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.
227	Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.
227	Did you get it?
227	If not I'll resend.
227	Just let me know.
227	Thanks
228	Hi Smith If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know what does.
228	My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.
228	We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.
228	In March Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring in people internally.
228	Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers move into the group.
228	As a result of this shift, we are not currently looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll let you know.
228	Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, asset development).
228	If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you back.
228	Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand ...
228	other organizations may be hiring.
228	I will be up in Portland, next week.
228	Maybe we can talk then Again, my apologizes on the long delay.
229	pretty skimpy but here it is.
230	please reformat - new tva12 thanks
231	FYI TVA did not send notice of MOPA exercise for the summer 01 period
232	Have a great weekend eating soggy hotdogs in misty, damp weather, dreaming of Genia on her cruise, all the while wondering about the meaning of quality time.
232	See you Monday am, not sharp.
232	Bye
233	Hi Susan How's things going?
233	I hope at least OK if not well.
233	Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .
233	Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.
233	We would, of course, love to come to your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well (wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after all it is your party - mine's next).
233	Let me know what you think.
233	Sager
234	Hi Alex THANKS - Ella rec'd the bathing suit and loves it.
234	She put it on and wouldn't take it off.
234	Perfect size.
234	Perfect gift.
234	WE ARE COMING - hope that's still OK.
234	We finally booked our flight to NY.
234	We are planning on coming up on Sat.
234	July 22nd and leaving on Sunday the 30th.
234	Not sure of the plans from there but will call you later.
234	If this doesn't work for you guys, let me know.
234	SO EXCITED about coming.
234	Talk to you soon.
235	Bob Here is what we sent TVA last year when we were notifying them of the delivery points we would have delivered to.
235	I'm tied up in meetings the rest of the day and we want to start notifying TVA of the delivery points we would have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver energy under the MOPA, Could you please revise accordingly and send back to Bill Rust and me this afternoon, We would like to start sending out tomorrow.
235	As always, thanks for your help.
235	Elizabeth
236	Dede, per your vm, here are our draft West definitions.
236	THESE ARE VERY MUCH IN DRAFT FORM.
236	I WILL DISCUSS WITH YOU LATER Elizabeth
237	I could make 1100.
237	Janice is out today so we can meet today without her and I will update her.
237	Let me know when and where.
238	As always, thanks for your help.
239	Rodgers As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.
239	I drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind.
239	Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly.
239	Thanks Elizabeth 36349
240	Hi Sorry to hear about being SICK - the only good there is re-experiencing the pure joy of being merely healthy.
240	After that nothing bad matters.
240	Would love to see you sometime - maybe next week lunch?
240	The Heights is still grand ...
240	too me.
240	Come by or call anytime.
240	Address 822 Columbia (on Columbia See ya Elizabeth
241	Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable Here is a rough draft.
241	I will also start on TVA letter.
241	Per my earlier vm, I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.
241	I'm not sure if we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the past. According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period. I will try to talk to him tonight.).
241	If TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument, what do we do?
241	Supply?
241	Terminate Again?
241	In either case our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.
241	Let me know what you think.
241	I'll be in early tomorrow.
241	Thanks
242	per my vm
243	Please review and forward comments to me early Thursday morning so we can distribute along with a copy of my explanatory memo.
243	I will forward a redraft of the memo to you for final review prior to distributing to John L and Dave D. Thanks
244	CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Please review attached memo and provide me comments early Thursday morning.
244	Kevin and Rodgers saw an earlier draft and I do not want to recirculate to them for their final review until we have all legal input.
244	Thanks
245	EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.
245	Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed.
245	Under ISDA for financial trading, this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).
245	Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE "the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate".
245	What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap.
245	I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.
245	If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.
245	This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.
245	Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are "artificially" determined after the trade was entered into.
245	While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.
245	I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.
245	So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue.
245	Thanks for your thoughts.

247	Andy Sorry to get back to you so late - I've been out of town and will be out all this week as well.
247	A meeting on 14th/15th in DC would be great for me.
247	Just let me know.
247	If you need to reach me this week - just leave me a voice Thanks Elizabeth
248	FYI I was also helping on this deal as was Jason.
248	Thanks Elizabeth
249	Confidential Attorney Work Product Not Discoverable Attached is a preliminary draft of the Legal Risk Chart.
249	You will need to open this in "Read Only mode" Richard and Jeff - As we discussed, I will need further assistance from you to complete several of the entries.
249	I have put your names by the entries that will either need to be updated or to be completed.
249	I believe Julia and Mark T would be the best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.
249	This document has limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise.
249	Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with your written comments.

250	CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.
250	PCA claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.
250	This amount appears to be based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, and certain "preference payments" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.
250	This claim is in its preliminary stages.
250	I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking.
250	As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount.
250	Bill In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information: 1.
250	Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we received from PCA would have been around May 20th).
250	2.
250	Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.
250	3.
250	The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939) As always, thanks for your help.
251	Hi Andy I received this email but for some reason I can't open it.
251	Today is my last day in the office until the 22nd.
251	Can you resend this to me and I will look at it when I get back next week.
251	If it can't wait that long, go ahead and send to David Portz and he may be able to assist you.
251	Look forward to talking to you soon.
251	Elizabeth
252	date has changed
253	lets discuss later today
254	Hi Carol!
254	Thrilled to hear all is going well.
254	I would love to play tennis anytime (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of that lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).
254	We can play at the Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.
254	Weekends would also work.
254	Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?
254	Call or write.
254	See you soon Elizabeth
255	Hi Peter Hope all is going well.
255	I received your message about a meeting today, August 30th.
255	Because of a prior commitment that starts at 3:30, I will not be able to attend - I will be in Thursday and Friday, so if there is anything I can do, just let me know.
255	Elizabeth
256	Confidential Not Discoverable Attorney work product I spoke w Richard - he agrees that Stuart should wait until after 5 BD to talk to the City and that it is ok to manage the position as we see fit.
257	Hi Harlan Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.
257	In that vain, I'd love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into meeting.
257	I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.
257	He would propose that he, Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.
257	Let me know what days would work for you.
257	Happy trails Elizabeth
258	Thanks for your voice mail.
258	In case you are wondering what my former secretary and long time friend thinks of me ....
258	This goes with a bigger story I will tell you about sometime when I can.
258	Talk to you later.
259	Dale and Nicole I unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the document you sent Can you either resend or get me a hard copy.
259	Thanks Elizabeth 36349
260	Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an "Into Product" is and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.
260	Attendees from Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.
260	If you think somebody else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I can talk to Harlan.
260	Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet with Dynegy.
260	As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define what an Into Product is.
260	Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined.
260	Dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that EEI's Into product was flawed.
260	Their position, while not completely expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area).
260	Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical.
260	At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product.
260	Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.
260	I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals: 1.
260	Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.
260	We trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading.
260	Critical to clear up this ambiguity.
260	2.
260	Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice against the Into definition.
260	3.
260	Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate.
260	Additionally, it is critical that we start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an RTO) Call me with any questions/thoughts.
260	Thanks Elizabeth
261	Hi Carol My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call any time.
261	This heat is unbelievable.
261	I've become weak in body and have recently only played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.
261	Just FYI I will be out of town next weekend but around after that.
261	Anytime you want to play, just give me a call.
261	Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme volatility in Western power prices, I can think of nothing more pleasant then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.
261	Go Davenport.
261	Lets hope Martina fares as well.
261	Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
261	Elizabeth
262	Hi Harlan Tuesday, Sept 12th from 2:30 to 5:30 at your offices works fine for us.
262	Lets reconfirm Monday afternoon.
262	Thanks Elizabeth
263	Mark Attached is the draft memo.
263	After you have had a chance to review, please call me with your thoughts/comments.
263	I would also like to briefly speak with John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this policy works in the east as well.
263	John is going to call me early this afternoon.
263	Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).
263	Finally, it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should distribute the memo.
263	Thanks Elizabeth
264	You vastly overstate my role but thank you nonetheless.
264	As always, an irreplaceable learning experience for me when we are communicating.
264	And so, I too, thank you.
264	Have a great weekend.
264	Maybe take a shower.
265	Attached is a rough draft, but I wanted to get you something before I left.
265	Please review and call me with any comments.
265	I will review again tonight and make final comments.
265	I will be out tomorrow but we can work with Kim to make final changes Thanks Elizabeth
266	No pre meeting necessary - we can just talk on way over.
267	Shari FYI Here is a confirmation I prepared (very quickly) for use with Entergy (that weird customer who will only use WSPP) when we need to do a firm deal under the WSPP.
268	Mark had the memo sent of Friday to the Executive Committee and all VPs.
269	Hi - Thanks for Sat.
269	- that was fun.
269	Can you play Tues or Thurs lunch?
270	see you on court 2 at 12:00
271	Leslie Do you have a hard copy I could take w me tomorrow to DC (valuable plane time work) Thanks
272	Melanie In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to arbitration for all issues.
272	When we first started trading power we limited arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going.
272	Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.
272	I only raised the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject to the arbitration provision or not.
272	In conclusion, based on today's policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any reason for us to be concerned with preserving an argument of limited applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.
272	I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.
272	Thanks Elizabeth
273	Thanks Anything fine but if individual orders are being followed, a large salad with vinaigrette dressing and some maque chou (sp?).
274	per our discussion yesterday
275	Shari Can you follow up and see what they want us to do on this ( I know its AEP but since its west, I thought you could do it most easily ... let me know if I'm wrong)
276	Hi I really enjoyed playing yesterday -thanks.
276	Can you hit on Wed.
276	afternoon or Thursday lunch or afternoon?
276	Talk to you soon
277	Hi Sheryl Hope all is well - we missed Eleanor on Sunday.

277	Give me a call when you get a minute.
277	Sager
278	SCEM - Sonnet Edmund's can be your first stop.
278	She has a new person who you will likely work with but I forget his name.
279	Hi Melanie I received your draft answer and am still trying to verify numbers.
279	When do we need to file?
279	Thanks Elizabeth
280	Hi John Thanks for WSJ article.
280	Now if only you could notify senior management over here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as well).
280	TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you now.
280	We have to send out on Thursday.
280	Do you have time to review and we can discuss tomorrow.
280	Thanks
281	great
282	John and Sam It would be great if you would follow this for us.
282	Please forward things to me.
282	Just FYI, PCA has sued us in the bankruptcy, for among other things, wrongful termination.
282	Call with any questions.
282	Thanks Elizabeth
283	Hi Andy I read through all of your Article this weekend .
283	What a job!
283	I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to me by Dede.
283	After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.
283	Thanks Elizabeth
284	Sheila FYI.
284	I will forward to you the written reviews I have done.
284	Thanks Elizabeth
285	Hi Will you call you later to discuss
286	Hi Leslie I would love to but I'm not sure right now about my schedule.
286	I'm moving offices and everything is a mess.
286	I will call you if it looks like I can get away.
286	If not I'll call (or please call me) in a couple of weeks (I'm out all next week).
286	See you soon Elizabeth Sager
287	this may help thanks
288	So sad.
288	No questions at all on EEI?
288	I'm dying having to write a 2 hour presentation on this despicable contract and I know not what to do it hurts me so bad.
288	Oh my.
288	Nice day for a run, even a slow one.
289	Mark This memo was sent to the Executive Committee, all ENA VPs and all ENA lawyers.
289	Thanks Elizabeth

303	If this doesn't work, I'm very flexible that week.
303	Let me know.
303	Thanks and I look forward to playing.
303	Elizabeth ps I'm out the rest of this week so lets confirm early next week.
304	Hi Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a lawyer could love ...
304	OK tolerate.
304	I'll send you the presentation by mail.
304	Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.
304	Looking forward to seeing you Friday.
305	Can you send him a hard copy (He is w Constellation) thanks
306	Could you also please send a copy to Andy
307	The 17th at 630 works great for me.
307	See you there.
308	sounds great - enjoy ps - Statement of Commitment sure looks interesting - what ever happened to indicative pricing and terms
309	Here is a draft of the PCA brief prepared by Dewey (head law firm of group effort).
309	Sam Behrends at Laboeuf is reviewing ( we just got today so he has not done so yet).
309	Sorry I didn't call you earlier about this.
310	Janice Moore and I have been helping Mitch w a proposal to connect Caledonia to Southern.
310	There is another project to expand the facility that we are not working on - I think maybe Sheila's group has that one.
310	Call me or Janice with questions.
311	This request from Shari is fine with me.
311	Could I also request a flat screen for my new office?
311	Thanks for your help.
311	Let me know what else I need to do.
312	Tennis on the 17th at 630 sounds great.
312	See you there.
313	fyi if you did not receive from shari
314	can you arrange this for after 200 or on friday thanks
315	Thanks for the update.
315	So far, we are still trying to schedule meeting s w PCAs lawyers so there is no date certain by which I need the information.
315	When we have one I'll let you know.
315	Thanks again.
316	Hi John Thanks for the call.
316	I'll be in Thursday all day after 10:00 (dentist in the am - yuk).
316	Lets try to get together then on the agency stuff.
317	Per keegan's vm, here is the only thing we handed out.
317	Let me know if you want to discuss.
318	Just in case Hope all is well
319	See you between 200 and 230
320	Janette Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting in Houston last week.
320	Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.
320	As you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for ISDA.
320	Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future meetings.
320	Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master for all trades.
320	I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.
320	Thanks for your help.
320	Elizabeth 36349 PS Mark At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.
320	It seems that there is alot of interest in this idea.
321	Hi Tim Thanks for your message.
321	We absolutely will forward to ISDA your message so that you can receive notices of the Energy Product meetings ( I thought you were already getting them).
321	Look forward to seeing you again soon.
321	Elizabeth
322	I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our relationship w Calpine is sensitive.
322	We do not need to push the EEI Master unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.
322	Just FYI, depending on the trade we would likely like to add product definition (eg West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).
322	John When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved.
323	Hi Dede Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week?
323	How about Monday (anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?
323	Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO language which I have not yet reviewed.
323	Maybe we can also schedule a real meeting on Monday to finalize.
323	Let me know if that works for you.
323	See ya.
324	Welcome back - hope your sojourn was not alarming (NY is not that bad a place to happen upon independence),and the autumn leaves made you smile.
324	Talk to you soon.
325	lets do Mon at lunch.
325	call you to confirm.
326	Still on for 1200 today?
326	Court 3.
326	See ya there unless I hear from you.
327	$20 gift certificate to Oshmans (I'll start Ella's career with only the finest racquet available).
327	I wonder what the A PLAYERS get.
328	Hi Stacey Outside counsel wants to schedule a meeting on the PCA calculations this Wed, the 25th.
328	Will you be able to have the data retrieved by then?
328	Let me know asap.
328	Thanks for your help.
328	Elizabeth
329	I thought this was to go to Dina.
329	Sorry
330	OK w me thanks
331	Hi Andy I was hoping when you get a chance, you could give me an update on where things were left at the recent meeting in DC and where we are going from here.
331	Also, are you are anybody else thinking of going to Ontario as they try to work through creating a Master Power form.
332	please print also
333	Hi Charlotte Thanks for your message.
333	I can't play Tues (Halloween night with the kids - they would never forgive me).
333	How about Wed, Thurs, Friday, the weekend or a week from this Tues.
333	Let me know what works for you.
334	Thanks for your help - the comments were great.
334	The only one I didn't understand was to "D".
334	Please review my revised draft and let me know if you think this works.
334	Thanks again.
335	sounds like fun
336	Looking forward to playing at 600 on Wed, court 12.
337	good luck.
337	please acquire food.
338	Hi Carol Was just wondering if you wanted to play tennis, maybe sometime next week (I'm trying to get excited about something next week - work has been very busy and I need to fill in it with other things).
338	Let me know if you want to try and play.
338	Hope all is well.
339	reservations for the 19th
340	Elizabeth Sager with Enron will be attending

342	any interest
343	Hi Carol How about Wed, the 8th?
344	Hi Melanie On PCA, the dates proposed w Richard are generally fine with me, so .....
344	On the Rockets, thanks very much ......
344	my husband and I would love to go to the Hornets game (16th).
344	Thanks again for lunch and I will talk to you soon.
345	Hi Christian Is this thing for financial or physical trading Thanks Elizabeth
346	Mark - for your approval 1.
346	Trip for me to San Diego to attend WSPP meeting.
346	2 Trip for Shari to Portland in November while Christian is on Thanksgiving holiday.
346	Thanks ps - I will schedule a meeting with you this week to discuss Shari/staffing in Portland office.
347	Meeting on 9th from 10 -12 has been scheduled.
347	Thanks
348	please schedule for me.
349	Can you please forward this to all lawyers in the power trading group.
349	Thanks
350	Mark As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.
350	The Canadian Master is based upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, differences in product and jurisdictional issues.
350	EEI has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th in Ontario to advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.
350	Peter Keohane, I know, wants the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you.
350	Do you think I should set up a meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.
350	At that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences.
350	Thanks Elizabeth
351	Janette I'm not sure what you are looking for but here is brief description for power trading ENA's Legal Power Trading group supports all of Enron's U.S.-based, wholesale trading legal requirements.
351	Enron is the largest marketer of wholesale power in the U.S. This group currently has 6 lawyers (one located in Portland).
351	Responsibilities include negotiating master trading agreements and structured power transactions, interfacing with industry trade groups to develop business practices and managing risks associated with the world's most volatile commodity.
351	Let me know if this is sufficient
352	Great!
352	The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance" to the Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the right).
352	Met is on the 6th floor.
352	I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be fine - just let me know.
352	Looking forward to playing.
353	THANKS
354	I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.
354	While Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely will eventually make the EEI contract the "default" contract if there are no other arrangements in place.
354	I would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.
355	5:30 would be fine - I've changed our court time.
355	See you then.
356	please send thanks
357	I will be there.
358	please print
359	There are cheap tickets to DC (160) this weekend and I was wondering if I should go.
359	My mom says she is just far too busy for me to come.
359	She is alone and Bob is not coming back until next week.
359	What do you think.
359	Ugh
360	Jim - Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
360	While I'm still checking, I am not aware that there is a "formal process" for being a board member of a non-corporate entity like SPP.
360	We would, however, want to look at the equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, protecting the members.
360	We can talk to SPP and see what there is.
360	Let me know if you want us to request/review documents.
360	Thanks
361	Chris Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?
361	Shari has had numerous conversations with a Greg Malcolm there and he has said that they are very interested in contracting with EPMI using EEI.
361	He and Shari have a call scheduled for Nov 20th.
361	Just curious.
362	Steve and Christian Could you please review and let me know what you think of this?
362	There is a call on Thurs at 200 (Central) to discuss.
362	Do you want to participate?
363	I'm available on the 8th
364	Tickets were still available so I'm going.
364	Commitment.
365	Regrettably, Enron also can not participate today - Monday does not work for me either but in my absence Shari Stack could participate.
365	Let me know and I will coordinate schedules with Shari.
366	I'm glad you cancelled.
366	I agree that the changes are much broader than we intended.
366	More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to DC this weekend, and likely out next week.
366	A short interlude but that's all.
366	On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).
366	Are you supporting the use of EEI in Canada.
366	I think I have our Canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to "Canadianize" it, thereby creating an EEI Canadian.
366	Any thoughts.
366	PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.
366	Still not going?
367	Hey I just realized I have babysitting on Friday.
367	Any chance you can play?
368	how about anytime between 2 and 3 Houston time.
368	If not, I could also do 1130.
368	Let me know
369	2 hours later my crown is on, my teeth are happy but for the #3 upper right molar, which the dentist says, unbeknown to me, is abscessed.
369	I now need a root canal.
369	Soon.
369	That will make 562,003 to 1.
369	Happy playing
370	please sign me up
371	please print
372	please put on my calender
373	love to - let me know what time on Tuesday works
374	as always you crack me up.
374	thanks for the help this am.
375	Just FYI - I'm going home.
375	No tennis tonight for me.
376	Hi Do you want to try and hit on Wed, either at lunch or after work
377	See you at 1130 unless I hear otherwise.
377	Thanks for getting it set up.
378	looks great.
378	thanks for your help.
379	is the tournament on Sat or Sun or both?
379	round robin?
379	thanks looking forward to hitting tomorrow
380	lets discuss this later thanks
381	Peter, just a follow-up to your email.
381	1.
381	I would agree that OPG is mistaken.
381	After the meeting, Chris and I and others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power.
381	On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ a product definition that works with the physical master.
381	I know Chris is already working on this.
381	From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not that different from NEPOOL.
381	In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master.
381	2.
381	I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).
381	This is what we did in UI.
381	This is what we do in the California pool.
381	This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.
381	I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct.
381	With the California product (CAISO energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix.
381	We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future.
381	In general, fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product.
381	When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated: Fm is only possible if the pool fails.
381	Just FYI, the god awful "Into"product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable.
382	Harrison called this am at home.
382	He said that you'all had discussed plans for Sat.
382	Because it's his B-day he wants to go out - He seemed to suggest that you were on board, so I said OK too.
382	Hope that's OK.
382	There may be a basketball game and dinner in the offing.
382	Talk to you soon.
383	done
384	I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might have to cancel - I would know by lunch).
384	If you want, we could maybe try hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.
384	If this doesn't work, just let me know and we can find another time.
385	see you there at 4:00 unless I call you
386	yuk.
386	so sorry to have to cancel that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 430 call to wrap it up don't they know we have better things to do here is to getting back on track after thanksgiving sorry again
387	per my vm
388	see you there on court 10 ps I may have to come back to work for a 615 call
389	no problem
390	Hi Mike I am definitely coming out for meeting on Monday - if you want to hit/play before meeting let me know and I'll bring my stuff.
390	See you there.
391	sounds great .
391	see ya there.
392	Hi Carol I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.
392	I used a service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).
392	Good luck on your search.
392	ps - Thanks for playing last week.
392	I look forward to playing again after Thanksgiving.
393	I would think so but not sure - it sounds like DP is in US
394	Thanks for the documents.
394	If OK w you, I will look at during my flight on Sunday and will call you on Monday am if I have any comments.
394	If this isn't OK, please leave me a voice mail and I will try to review earlier.
394	Thanks Elizabeth PS - Chris, I agree with your comment re the EEI copyright and references - I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it an""EEI Canada"? Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in the name of the organization that "approves" it? Is that OK w EEI? Maybe you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to
395	Jeff I enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to Houston.
395	As promised, here is the information about the Ontario meeting regarding the creation of a Physical Power Master for Canada.
395	Don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts or comments.
395	Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager
396	Attached is draft escrow language for Black Hills that I made up in an attempt to be sympathetic to Black Hills's desire for certainty on the release of funds - please review and call Shari with comments first thing on Wed.
396	I will be travelling Wed but will check messages on Wed afternoon.
396	Good luck
397	At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).
397	Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review.
397	Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.
397	Thanks for your input.
398	Hi We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 1st.
398	That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.
398	SO I'm writing invitations now.
398	Here it is: Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?
398	Around 10:00?
398	We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer to .....
398	shop.
398	PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday.
399	Thanks for your message Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.
399	Coaching seems to be his real passion.
399	I'm sorry I can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are scrambling to find a birthday concept.
399	On a better note, I can play all this week.
399	Any day, any time works for me - let me know when you can.
399	Talk to you soon.
400	Welcome back - I will call you later this afternoon.
400	Do you think you or Steve could look at this stuff relating to something in the WSCC
401	Let's try for thurs at 1130 - call me if you need to change time/date.
402	Sorry for the delay but here it is - A good landscape architect in the Heights is Pam August (husband name Todd) who lives on Cortdlandt (sorry no number) between 7th and 8th.
403	HI Just got this message - email at home couldn't open attachment.
403	Go ahead a send rest when you can, no problem.
403	Hey, will you send me your new address.
403	thanks
404	I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.
404	My mom wants us to stay at a hotel while in DC.
404	I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.
404	Bob is out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend to stay with Mom while Bob is out.
404	What do you think.
404	PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.
404	Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.
404	What do you think.
405	Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable Top Legal Risks 1.
405	Power Forms - Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.
405	Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination damages, broad performance outs.
405	2.
405	Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent acting on behalf of several operating companies.
405	This creates uncertainty as to which entity is liable for which trades.
405	3.
405	Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.
405	4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.
405	5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on a very tight time schedule.
405	6.
405	Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on how to document transactions involving power.
405	7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure everybody understands risks associated with transactions.
405	Documentation Projects 1.
405	EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen reliance on WSPP.
405	2.
405	One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual transactions that are not part of a master.
405	3.
405	Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power product definitions.
405	4.
405	Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 5.
405	Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading - work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll that into single contract for physical and financial trading
406	Mark , I assume that I should continue work on this.
406	If its OK with you, I would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for physical/financial(maybe) trading.
406	Thanks Elizabeth
407	I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of the standard to be applied - I quickly revised your section to give you an idea of what I was thinking.
407	In any event I think you are absolutely on the right track.
407	Good luck and let me know what else I can do.
408	Chi is now confused.
408	She want to do the wedding but is feeling overwhelmed by all the issues: Mom Her sickness John Short notice for all involved creating tension She and Douglas feeling stressed as a result of above Mom She seeks advice from a sage Midwesterner.
408	What do you think - Delay or hasten onward
409	Sorry I didn't get too far but What I read I think is looking great - good luck
410	Hi John Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a meeting.
410	The Black Hills deal is still stuck in credit land so I will call the Denver office if need be.
410	Thanks again and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
411	Hi Charlotte I'd love to play but I can't this week.
411	Yuck.
411	Let's try next week.
411	PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a different rhythm.
411	Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too See you soon

417	Hi Phil Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000 with the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all - You are invited with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more leisurely morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them home.

417	thanks
418	I'm going to DC at 400 on sat.

420	Kaye Please forward the attachment Thanks
421	I'll get on it Mon.
421	Have a great weekend.
422	Please forward to person who is looking at Midam Thanks
423	Janice Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting issues.
423	Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.
424	Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.
424	Concept is fine, but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of a draft confirm that we use with TVA.
425	Any way you think Andrew might like power trading?
425	His resume looks strong.
426	Thanks for resending message.
426	I look forward to playing later in December
427	Yeah - go ahead and see if he wants a challenging position in a rewarding place.
427	Thanks
428	absolutely.
428	see you on sat around 530.
428	ps - wildfires not just there - I've heard as well over here.
428	Congratulations
429	I'm not sure about Sat - Grant has been trying to get a sitter - he called Lynne and Cecilia.
429	Are you going?
430	Hi Thanks for the good news - It pleases me to know end to be creating EEI babies throughout the world - bandwidth is also using it.
430	Hooray Brenda should have sent a presentation I did that summarizes EEI - Hope its helpful;avoid the DISASTER - it only applies in the US.
430	Also, Andy's article may be helpful.
430	Have a great weekend.
431	Elizabeth Sager and Grant Cox 822 Columbia Houston Texas 77007
432	yes
433	Mark Attached is a draft of the chart of power risks.
433	Let me know if there is anything else you would like me to do on this.
433	We are still in the process of reviewing top exposures with credit.
433	Elizabeth 36349
434	Hi Charlotte Hope you had a good trip last week.
434	Work has been horrendous - power and gas prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the same onslaught.
434	When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) or Wed next week.
434	Let me know what works for you.
434	See ya
435	sounds great but let me check w Grant and I will call you tomorrow
436	Dinner on Sat would be great.
436	Lovely xmas card.
437	So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring in the Dr office) - she wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.
437	If she asked I would likely give her some barbiesque items for the reasons you stated (she's going to get them from somebody someday).
438	FYI - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on finalizing Shari's move to Portland.
438	Shari is looking for a "relocation" package.
438	HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that works.
438	HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H and then present to Shari.
438	End of Feb is still the target date.
438	Hope all well (despite the press).
438	Elizabeth
439	Hi Shari I need help as well from JS on those two issues.
439	On the LDC supply we need to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we discuss.
439	Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from LDC.
439	CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but?
439	..
439	I put a call into JS
440	Thanks for your message - sorry to hear your schedule ( I thought mine was bad).
440	No problem from my side not playing until 2001 - let's talk that first week and arrange a time.
440	Hope you have a great holiday in NY.
441	enjoy the snow
442	With pleasure.
442	822 Columbia Houston Texas 77007
443	Hi I'm thrilled you are also speaking at ISDA.Thanks Any chance you can hit on Wed?
443	If not we may have to resume our REGULAR WEEKLY SCHEDULE after the holidays.
443	Let me know.
444	Thanks for dinner on Sat - As always, Grant and I really enjoyed getting together with you guys.
444	Lets pretend its my birthday in January and go again.
444	See ya
445	Hi I would love to but don't think I will be able to - we leave for DC on Friday morning.
445	How about the following week?
446	Still waiting on numbers, but wanted to see if this explanation would work, Give me a call when you get a chance.
446	Elizabeth
447	Mark Attached are my comments to your Hypotheticals.
447	Call with any questions Thanks Elizabeth
448	Attached is a chart showing how I thought the PGE assignment could work.
448	Let me know what else we can do.
448	Thanks
449	I think attachment is missing since I didn't get confirm.
449	Check w genia re paper - I think we have something but is skimpy
450	You are correct on the facts PGET pays a higher price to Morgan than EES pays to PGET - hence the payment to EES
451	thanks we will likely need to simple corporate help as well to work on assignments/termination - if possible maybe you could get somebody to assist to also be on call.c
452	As promised.
452	THANKS
453	per my vm
454	David Could you work with Joe Wagner on this.
454	thanks
455	Attached are drafts of documents that we prepared and LLGM fixed.
456	This chart shows Morgan as CP - we are also doing similar deal with Avista.
456	We are trying to sign Avista tomorrow.
457	Primary Document with Avista
458	Hi David FYI - Janice is out until the 22nd of Jan. so when you are finished with comments, please send them to me as well.
458	As soon as we have the "live" deal give me a call and we will see who has availability to assist you.
458	Thanks Elizabeth 36349
459	please call after reading
460	All done?
461	Hooray
462	hooray
463	Credit contact person is William Bradford at 713 853 3831 or you can call me
464	thanks
465	John I think the letter looks good.
465	I made a few changes which I am enclosing.
465	thanks
466	Preliminary draft not yet reviewed by EES - let me know if you have comments PS - Powerx deal is not one of the assigned transactions.
466	thanks
467	Please deliver to Peter ASAP thanks
468	I think it would be better in a side letter so as not reinvovle Avista at this point and raise any new issues - is that ok
469	CY please work through w Tim thanks
470	Thanks again for all your help
471	Hi I am here.
471	We are closing tonight.
471	Call when you can.Thanks
472	Here are the revised documents that we will need EEMC to sign.
472	Please coordinate signatures w Travis.
472	Thanks Elizabeth
473	FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction that are being sent out for signature tonight.
473	Thanks for everybody's help in getting this done.
473	I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.
473	Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing to all parties.
473	Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.
473	Also PGET must release cash collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.
473	Thanks again.
474	Hi Angela Sorry I did not get back in touch w you earlier - my mom passed away over the holidays and I have been out of the office and don't know exactly when I will be back (definitely out the week of 15th).
474	I look forward to playing and will call you when I get back to play.
475	Bill told us last night the true up payments run to PGET
476	documents prepared by Shari w LLG help, sent to Avista (i just found that out)
477	Any idea where EES is on this this am - I'm meeting w Mark H now to discuss.
478	please print
479	fyi - we have right to terminate EEMC power positions assumed by EPMI and have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if they don't help us on the collateral issues.
480	Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable A. PGE I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the underlying contracts": 3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million 4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a threshold (either $100 million or $50 million): 2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million) 5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 million - see contract 2 above) 6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million 7. PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent (PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000. We have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due. Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01. Before terminating, we would need to verify actual contract language. B. SCE Default SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to a power sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then terminate and accelerate amounts due. Amounts payable could offset amounts owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland General.

508	Hi John Thanks for the offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out LLGM.
508	I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I still liked my job.
508	I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it could be better.
508	I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when I asked him if he liked his job.
508	Oh well, any connections there?
508	I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you and Jim.
508	I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.
508	Let me know what time works for you.
509	Richard just told me that we settled PCA.
509	That's great news but I will miss the opportunity to work with you.
509	Thanks for all your help on this matter and I hope we get to work together again on some other matter in the near future.
510	I don't know much but I think Dan Lyons is well versed on this.
510	Also maybe Dale R in Portland.
510	Hope all is well.
511	I'm open all day
512	please send my bio
513	badge no 11592
514	How about meeting for lunch on Tues at Ruggles (on Main) at noon?
515	how about 400
516	I do have a conflict so 400 would be better
517	after would work great for me
518	Hi John You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time so....).
518	Now that you are back, I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be shattered.
518	Meanwhile, I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.
518	And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at 900 Houston time to discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?
518	If not, no big deal.
518	Talk to you soon.
519	sounds great meet you on Smith at 1145?
520	EPMI/Comed capacity deal was never filed (EPMI has no current requirement to file).
520	The owner of the facility never filed anything on the assumption that there was an oral, short term arrangement.
520	FERC requires approval for assignments in excess of $50,000.
520	Does this help?
521	chart distributed to isda
522	Hi Andy I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the 1st panel and I would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.
522	Also, I'd be happy to do products on day 2.
522	Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.
522	PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have met during this process.
523	Harlan cancelled lunch - How about playing tennis earlier and skipping lunch
524	power marketers are not required to file
525	Hi Chris - Hope all is well.
525	Are you and Tracy coming to Texas ...
525	for the conference?
526	Andy I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.
526	I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak.
526	If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one available) I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye surgery in am so.. but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron building. His number is 713 853 9239. Thanks Elizabeth 36349
527	yep -hooray!
528	I think it would be a good idea to distribute a sample MNA - maybe you could forward it to Liz Sullivan and see if she can get it in the "package".
528	I'm not sure about overheads something would likely be nice but I'm not sure what yet.
528	Lets talk on Monday Thanks

529	Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in. Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend.

546	Andy Sorry I missed you on Friday.
546	My panels are fine the only problem is that I'm on the 12:10 flight back to Houston on Friday (So is Dede I think) Is there any way we can make second talk on Friday earlier or else Dede and I can speak first and then step off panel?
547	CY I'm not sure - I kind of think we need to keep going to some of these meetings, if nothing else to educate the industry and to listen to the western crowd.
547	With limited resources we will need to figure out which ones but ...
547	Talk to you later ES
548	Can we talk about this in am (tues)?

557	My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.
557	A trusted companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet "O's", he looking for food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' voices began.
557	Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month feels.
557	Hopefully this to will pass.
557	Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.
557	ps - Great work on WAPA; I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR will close.

566	Peter Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe harbor provisions.
566	If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.
566	Hope all is well.
567	Ship it up.If you want it we could look up blue book value and then figure out an appropriate valuation.
567	If you don't want it, you are Chi could sell it in DC or you could use it for a trade in. If shipping is expensive and you want to fly down and drive up, I will pay for flight.

623	Looking forward to seeing you in Newport.
624	no survey present when I open site - please advice
625	Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about product but without definition).
625	OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.
625	We do not commonly use those definitions
626	Mark I am not aware of any contracts similar to those described by Sharon.
627	Only 53 signed up so far but here it is - frequently more arrive at last minute.
627	Steve Marcus Nettelton is doing EOL while Leslie is on maternity leave.
627	Have a great weekend
628	fine with me
629	After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM and other rights to interrupt.
629	Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).
629	ps if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.
629	Thanks Have a great weekend.
630	I'm sorry I thought you might still be here.
630	I'm travelling the rest of this week so how about April 24th or 25th next week?
631	Lets do it when you are in Houston on Monday
632	Hi Mike Dede and my husband and I are all bringing our racquets hoping to get in some tennis on either or both Wed and Thurs?
632	Can you join us?
632	Let me know.
633	great
634	One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently make us forget how good life is.
634	So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where.
634	After trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.
634	And then it came to me.
634	An epic.
634	A history.
634	A sense of time, commitment and value.
634	A place where my roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).
634	And of course there is the hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in the Casino.
634	And the Gods must have seen this coming too.
634	Being meager and always wanting to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.
634	Not to be found.
634	Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.
634	Other than in the sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.
634	I knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out of my hands.
634	I fought and won.
634	I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.
634	At this rate I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.
634	May Shelby be with us all providing sustaining .......
634	es
635	Can you get EEI and cover sheet and riders to Carol thanks es
636	I'm out this week giving a seminar - the head of the rival power form WSPP and me Miss EEI are giving presentations on why our documents are the best.
636	Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the better form) so it looks like we will have to push it till the week of the 23rd Any day that week is good.
636	Way to go again on your sweet victory this weekend.
637	Thanks for yesterday - It's a wonderful tradition that I look forward to every year.
637	Also, I spoke w Pam and does Tues at 700 work for you?
637	Thanks again
638	Thanks for the book and bikes - Ella is in love with the bike with the basket.
638	How about lunch next week?
639	absolutely - see you at your house as darkness falls
640	I'm thrilled - see you in Newport (when do you get in?)
641	how about Wed, April 25th
642	Thanks for the explanation.
642	Can you also get the actual interest rate used for each group on terminated transactions (eg the financial trades, the power trades, the US gas trades and the Canadian gas trades).
642	Thanks
643	Bill I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.
643	He is currently trying to get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us to take back our security in light of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, court has not been willing to allow us to remove.
643	Richard continues on the case.
643	In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to expire without drawing down.
643	So we should go ahead and renew.
644	Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E.
644	In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all the matters in one letter.
644	For each product line, I thought we could attach all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do).
644	Each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter: 1.
644	Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC 2.
644	Copy of transaction confirmations 3.
644	Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E 4.
644	Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s) 5.
644	Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same 6.
644	Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated trade 7.
644	Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle) 8 List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the extent available, written confirmation of such quote I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.
644	Thanks for all your help.
644	Elizabeth Sager
645	THANKS
646	Go ahead and sign it - I did.
646	The law in Va. is that once appointed you can not revoke (I spoke w counsel on this).
646	Mom's probate estate is very small.
646	thanks
647	Hi Any chance you could hit Thursday or Friday?
647	By then I'll also have the scoop on Newcombe's clinic.
647	Talk to you soon.
648	great - how about Thursday lunch
649	Still on?
649	Hope so - let me know where you would like to go (I can meet at 1230 or thereafter)
650	See you at Redwood Grill at 1230 (I've never been there!)
651	CONFIDENTIAL/NOT DISCOVERABLE Attached is letter that went to PG&E yesterday - It will not likely get disclosed unless PG&E elects to go public with it.
651	We are continuing to have discussions with PG&E about this letter and are planning to meet next week.
651	Call with any questions.
652	ISDA language.
652	Thanks for your help.
653	I have never heard of Jeff.
654	Thanks for everybody's help on this - while we are at it we may as well puttogether 5 additional sets so we can distribute to those on whom the powershines.
654	To: David Portz/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marcus Subject: Re: Mid May EAS In-Service for Power Group David, Yes, please identify the principle background items that Carol needs as therest will have to be done after the conference.
654	Thanks, rol St Subject: Mid May EAS In-Service for Power Group Genia -- May I have your help in readying a binder for the above referencetraining session?
654	Carol St. Clair has requested materials to be assembledbefore the Enron Law Conference next week so she can begin reviewing them athe conference, if possible.
654	(If this will not be possible, lets get her thprinciple background items available, which I'll be glad to identify for yofrom those gathered as of Tuesday.) I'm thinking that to we can update materials already assembled in a past binder*.
654	Please organize the materials, on double-sided copies where possible, and put together the tables of contents.
654	Proposed contents of the principal binder with full titles each item and dawhen available stated in TOC (as opposed to the shorthand utilised below), would be: EEI Master Agreement with schedules EPMI format of cover sheet "Riders" Current form of Enron Corp. Guarantee Note: Marcus maintains the above in a velo binder for easy reference.

658	Peter I just remembered I have a Dr appointment on the 10th at 400 - can Derek make it at 300
659	not yet but soon
660	Attached is draft agreement - If possible, I would like to get this out to Larry within the next hour ( I promised to send it first thing Monday am).
660	Thanks for your fast review.
661	Larry: In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on Wednesday.
661	My comments primarily involve the following: (1) As you and I discussed last week, I thought it made sense to specify areasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.
661	I proposed a one month period to do that.
661	If the parties can,t come to anagreement in that time period, then the &mechanics8 in the MPA for resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be&reactivated.8 Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can always extend the date.
661	I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period tomake sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolutionAssuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of theextension of the &stay8 would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself (as opposed to this letter).
661	(2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, andthat requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.
661	Thus, the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the &Initial Extension Period8 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).
661	Your draft had provided that Enron would be required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to breached.
661	My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreedto by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by the parties, rather than as part of this letter.
661	Also, we note that, as a contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to kein place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of a termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part See Sec.
661	5.5.
661	(3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron &agrees8 to enter into new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on &commerciallyreasonable terms.8 The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiationstowards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron,s part to efa contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the parties, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed tthis letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eacof the parties.
661	Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoinor on the revised letter.
661	Thanks in advance for your help in moving thisforward.
661	Elizabeth Sager "Witalis, Lawrence (Law)" , "Wan, Fong (Corp)" , "Sena, David", "Foley, Jack" , "Pearce, Karola (Law)" , "Harvey, Kent" , "Bar-Lev, Joshua (Law)" Subject: Stand-Still Agreement Ms. Sager: Attached is my draft of an agreement memorializing the parties' respective commitments as we negotiate the amount of the Termination Payment and of other claims Enron may have against PG&E in Bankruptcy Court.
661	I do not havyour mailing address; yet, PG&E would like to receive assurance soon that Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement.
661	After reviewing the draft, please indicate Enron's agreement by return e-mail to me.
661	Or, please call me (415-973-3817) to discuss.

807	Hi Peter We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.
807	I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.
807	Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at?
807	Thanks Elizabeth Sager
808	Can you help me figure out how to get access to this.
808	I get this message everyday and don't know what to do.
809	DItto
810	yes

821	Hi Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.
821	At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.
821	In the darkness of early morning, we continued.
821	A temporary calm exists; the tropical depression looms.
821	Call you when the rain ceases.
821	ps Boston was great, thanks
822	Hi Larry Thanks for the email and the first draft.
822	I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.
822	Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.
822	Thanks again for all your help.
822	Talk to you soon.
823	Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.
823	Larry is fine with all changes.
823	Please review and let me know if you have any comments.
823	Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).
823	Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this?
823	Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?
823	Elizabeth Sager
824	Unbelievable - thanks for the call.
824	How about lunch the week of July 9th?
825	(in my directory 2001/pg&e/extension1.doc) thanks Elizabeth Sager
826	Hi Larry I haven't talked to Bill, but everyone else is OK with letter.
826	I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.
826	Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.
826	If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.
826	Thanks
827	Hi Here is report revised to reflect my changes/additions - call if you have any questions or would like for me to do this in a different way in the future.

833	thanks for the vm incredible!
833	lunch next week?
833	have a great 4th
834	Hi Chris 1.
834	We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.
834	It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.
834	Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.
834	2.
834	Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.
834	(ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).
834	Hope all is good and Addy is doing well.
834	Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.
834	See ya all soon I hope.
835	Hi John Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate mom's IRA into 3 accounts.
835	Can you email me your SS#.
835	Thanks
836	Interest on the 17th?
837	please print thanks
838	great - can we still get the 17th?
839	Hi John Thanks for your voice mail.
839	Way to go on Site.
839	Lunch on Wed sounds great if you are still planning on coming.
839	Talk to you soon.
839	Elizabeth Sager
840	Do you have Doris's (the accountants) last name and/or telephone number.
840	The accountant in VA continues to piss me off and I wanted to see if Doris might be able to help.
840	Elizabeth Sager
841	Hi Andy I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending "adoption" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).
841	This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.
841	I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th.
841	Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.
841	Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.
842	Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.

842	Hope all is well.
843	oops
844	The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat ....
844	on your trip ......
844	tomorrow.
844	It really is cold you know.
844	My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ...
844	they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).
844	They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.
844	Which by the way, I hope you got to see.
844	Monday's match was unbelievable.
844	Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ...
844	oh, never mind.

851	no problem
852	Hi Martin Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.
852	I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US) Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.
852	Good luck.
853	Sounds great - thanks for your help.
854	GREAT THANKS
855	Are you attending for Christian per his dire request - if so, fyi.
856	Hi Ken In accordance with Lisa's call to you, here are revised drafts of the Modification Agreement and LC for your review.
856	By copy of this email I am at the same time circulating the documents for review by others at Enron.
856	I apologize in advance for not sending a blackline (a glitch here prevented me from making final changes in blackline) - if you are unable to make a marked copy from your prior version, let me know and I will attempt Tuesday morning to send you one.
856	Thanks again for your help in getting this finalized.
857	Honored speaker invitation only

865	She is out today but will be in Friday and Monday.
865	Thanks.
865	Elizabeth Sager
866	Just in case I forgot earlier - good luck (materials I promise are on the way DOWN to you)
867	Dear Mark While your judgment is normally so sound, do you really think we are headed in the right direction here with next Friday's designated speaker.
867	Is this appropriate for this super important, interested, motivated and highly discriminating group?
867	Enthusiasm is evident but ....
867	Your dutiful, obedient servant, only desirous of what's best for Enron.

891	Hi Cindy My name is Elizabeth Sager and I work with Carol St Clair at Enron.
891	She and I play tennis periodically and she said that you may be looking for players for a 4.5 singles league at Memorial on Wed nights.
891	If you need players, I would be interested in playing.
891	I'm traveling most of this week and out for the weekend but if you still need players let me know - if you want we could arrange a time to hit.
891	Thanks - talk to you soon.

894	work wise, nothing jumps to mind (Azurix as I'm sure you are aware is the best move you never made),, but I will keep my ears open and my thinking cap on.
894	Elizabeth Sager
895	Ellen We did not sell anything until after June 30th.
895	Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.
895	Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use?
895	I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.
895	If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.
895	Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?

899	Nothing to date has been communicated to PGE re settlement.
899	I'll keep you posted (that's a joke).
899	Elizabeth Sager
900	I agree - a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.
900	To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.
900	From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.
900	Elizabeth Sager
901	please process for payment - thanks Elizabeth Sager
902	Elizabeth Sager
903	Hi thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w CY.
903	Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought, rolled.
903	Now we know it doesn't.
903	I don't think our other products roll.
903	How about a brief call w you me and CY.
903	Sorry to add layers off confusion, but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...
903	Elizabeth Sager
904	Elizabeth Sager
905	sounds great - meet you there Elizabeth Sager
906	Hi Can you get these to Ed Thanks Elizabeth Sager
907	Hi Travis I already told Mark that I wanted you and Kay to go and he seemed to think that it was a good idea.

907	Thanks Elizabeth Sager
908	Elizabeth Sager
909	I'll call you later in this Thanks Elizabeth Sager

918	Hope the rest of you weekend went well.
918	Talk to you soon.
918	Elizabeth Sager
919	I could only get a court from 5-6.

924	Hi How about trying to hit on Wed (afternoon) or Thurs (lunch).
924	Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager
925	Hi Limor The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of the DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written agreement of all parties involved.
925	We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, starting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters together and permit setoff on a square basis.
925	This undertaking requires a fairly extensive due diligence review.
925	Hope this explanation helps.
925	Call if you want to discuss further.
925	Elizabeth Sager
926	see you there Elizabeth Sager
927	Elizabeth Sager
928	My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.
928	Upon Clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.
928	(CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).
928	But in the meanwhile a preview.
928	The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally, taking credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).
928	After hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.
928	Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.
928	He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.
928	I asked why.
928	He said too painful.
928	What pain.
928	He said Shari Stack.
928	I said one bad day in Newport.
928	He stopped talking.
928	He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP.
928	, I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....
928	Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet another name for himself.
928	Elizabeth Sager
929	Elizabeth Sager
930	Hi Big news.
930	We will make a settlement offer.
930	$102.

931	Vicki As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.
931	There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES.
931	Some of these have been outstanding since November 2000.
931	There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.
931	Some of these have been outstanding since March 2001.
931	The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.
931	Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation.
931	Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.
931	Thanks in advance for your assistance.

933	Hi Ellen I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.
933	Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.
933	Right?
933	I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.
933	What is happening in the VA probate?
933	When will I receive a draft of the return?
933	I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax?
933	is that right?
933	Elizabeth Sager

952	To the best of my knowledge the following are the settlement numbers for PG&E: Enron Canada Corp. March receivables unchanged.
952	Enron North America Corp. No physical flow in April.
952	All receivables from March.
952	No change.
952	Enron Power Marketing, Inc. March receivables unchanged.
952	Please call if you have any questions.
952	Bill Elizabeth Sager

960	Sorry for the confusion.
960	Elizabeth Sager
961	Cindy I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before.
961	I don't know the rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.
961	I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile....
961	do you know what the rules require.
961	I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.

968	Elizabeth Sager
969	Ed As you requested attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.
969	This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.
969	The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.
969	This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.
969	If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.
970	fyi talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager

993	Hi Here are Relaint's comments - let me know if there is anything you want me to do on this.
993	Thanks Elizabeth Sager
994	Hi Scott Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.
994	Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.
994	I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.
994	We also add others from time to time.
994	Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.
994	Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.
994	On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.
994	(We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.) If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page.
994	This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments Elizabeth Sager
995	here are some sample letters - this one is Mary's start - she did not go all the way through it.
995	It is based on the PG&E letters.
995	Elizabeth Sager
996	David I read this article and it looks ok to me - can you also read it (for legal issues and general correct information to the extent you know but not grammer, good writing...) and let me know if you see anything, Thanks.
997	Susan Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft.
997	I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.
997	Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.
997	Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response
998	article is ok with me

1051	HI So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing.
1051	I like the proposal to merge the discussions but...
1051	You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.
1051	After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.
1051	I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.
1051	What do you think is the next best step?
1051	ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.
1051	Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.
1051	We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.
1051	Lets talk about this also.
1051	Hoping not to stay the course, again.
1051	Talk to you soon.
1051	Elizabeth Sager
1052	Attached is the PG&E schedule.

1078	Elizabeth Sager
1079	I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.
1079	For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.
1079	As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.
1079	Elizabeth Sager
1080	thanks Elizabeth Sager
1081	Yuck - The hearing just got cancelled (I was on the way to the airport when notified) and rescheduled for Tuesday.

1083	intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.
1083	I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.
1083	This issue needs to be addressed soon.
1083	Elizabeth Sager

8	Jay, I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed to me.
8	I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th of each month if possible.
8	I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).
8	Please help.
8	Thanks.

17	To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books: ENA-IM Mid Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.
17	It would be helpful if we could have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.
17	The two traders involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

26	I'm glad he is staying.
26	I think it says something about his commitment to the program he built.
26	It also says a little about the Big XII.

34	Jay, I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual funds.
34	Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.
34	And I really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.
34	It looks like the transfers worked properly.
34	But are the automatic purchases of mutual funds in place?
34	I don't see the activity on the web page.
34	Lastly, and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.

48	I plan on bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.
48	I can't believe it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.
48	We are doing well here in Houston.
48	Everyone is getting ready for the school year.
48	In fact, Kristi has already started back.
48	The kids begin on the 9th.
48	Enron still seems to monopolize my time.
48	But it's a great place to work.
48	Let me know about that weekend.
48	I hope you will be in town as I am looking forward to seeing you all.
48	DG
49	Kim, How are you?
49	I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it worked.
49	I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.
49	I plan on taking the whole group up for the KU-UT game.
49	I hope you will be in town as well.
49	Let me know.

52	Call if you have any questions.
52	Thanks DG
53	Kevin, I just wanted to mention a few things.
53	I'm sure you are doing them already most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.
53	Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for every EOL deal Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, just let me know and I'll follow up.
53	Thanks.
53	DG
54	I have a friend who is looking to change employers.
54	He is in the IT field.
54	I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.
54	Although, he would be interested in any similar job.
54	I will attach his resume.
54	What is the best way to get his resume in front of the proper people?
54	I would appreciate your opinion.
54	I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron that does.
54	Thanks in advance for your help.
54	DG
55	I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.
55	So I am sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and have asked for help from the HR dept.
55	I didn't think this would take so long.
55	I appologize, but I am still trying.
55	DG
56	Thanks.
56	I'm obviously not very observant.
56	DG
57	Well, I hate to write this, but I found out last night that I will have to be in Chicago next Wednesday thru Friday.
57	Call me.
57	DG
58	I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.
58	I held back $1,087,409 from the MEH book.
58	The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was $20K added to the P&L last Friday.
58	I did not add that amount back in tonight.
58	I don't know what it is.
58	I'll talk to you in the morning.
58	Let me know if there is something you want me to send you.
58	Thanks.
58	DG
59	Could you please follow up on this.
59	Thanks.
59	DG
60	Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get them to calc.
60	So they are not in these numbers.
60	They will be tonight.
60	See you guys later today.
60	DG
61	I'm in the office.

61	Hopefully for a weekend the Cubs are in town.
61	I love you.

62	He started to cry last night when you said you were not going to sign him up.
62	I think we can.
62	Starting Sep 1, I will not be running a book.
62	I will be able to leave at a decent hour on scheduled days.
62	So I will be able to help.
62	Let me know what you think.
62	DG
63	Daniel, Laura Luce would like to send the latest Enovate DPR to the chairman of People's Corp. But the copies we receive have some sort of protection which I'm sure you are aware of.
63	Will you please send her the latest so that she can forward it to this guy?
63	Let me know if that is a problem.
63	Thanks.
63	DG I am in Chicago today.

65	Remember to look at your school schedule so we can book our flights to Kansas.
66	OK
67	How was class?
67	I'll see you tonight.
68	It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.
68	I also don't receive statements in the mail for the account.
68	It looks as if the automated transactions worked this month.
68	DG
69	Yes.
69	Just after lunch if possible.
69	It's bid week.
69	Thanks.
69	DG 3-9573
70	I'll see you at 1:00 DG
71	After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of questions.
71	So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.
71	I was hoping to get this done today.
71	But for sure by the end of the week.
71	I want to ask you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.
71	See you at 1:00.
71	DG
72	Kristi wanted me to send you a note saying we will be there for the game on Saturday.
72	See you there.
72	DG
73	I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.
73	Sorry.
73	Like I said yesterday, I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.
73	I just need to follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.
73	I'm also working on OA issues for July.
73	I will teach a class on Thursday and next Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, and liquidations).
73	In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the Trunkline deal.
73	When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain the deal to her.
73	That's about it.
73	Once again, I apologize about missing the meeting today.
73	DG 3-9573
74	You should see this from Luchas tonight.
74	DG Enron North America Corp.
75	Susan, Do you have a ticket for the above referenced deal?
75	I am trying to find Sitara numbers, but I don't have a ticket for the deal.
75	Let me know.
75	Thanks.
75	DG 3-9573
76	Did you grant the $750 in orig from the ticket I gave you yesterday?
76	Let me know.

78	I killed 279644.

81	Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal?
81	I don't even know his last name.

86	Steve, Attached is a list of the Hub Deals we have currently in the system.
86	I tried to reconcile them to the sheet you sent me but could not.
86	Please take a look at these and give me a call.
86	Thanks.
86	DG
87	Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to make.
87	I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system: Enovate LLC.
87	Under this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg: FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.
87	The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.
87	The FT-ENOVATE book will be a flat book only used for the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT book to be confirmed).
87	The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the interest rate group.
87	This book will be used for EMW related deals not specific to Enovate.
87	The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the following books in Tagg: FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra TP.
87	FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.
87	The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.
87	The other columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.
87	I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to set up a new entity as well.
87	I have run this by accounting and have their approval.
87	Let me know what you think and we will start the process.
87	We will have this completed by the end of this month.
87	Thanks.
87	DG
88	Mark, I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have booked for the HUB deals.
88	He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.
88	Richard suggested I contact you since Steve is out.
88	Attached is a list of deals we currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.
88	They need to be verified before I can calc them for value and positions.
88	I will be out tomorrow, returning on Monday.
88	Thanks for your help.
88	Please call me with any questions.
88	DG
89	Gary, I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.
89	I submitted a request this morning to create a new counterparty: Enovate, LLC which will be an Enron entity.
89	Under Enovate LLC I need two books: FT-ENOVATE and INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).
89	I also need a book which will fall under the current Enron MW, LLC counterparty: FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).
89	And as usual I need these as soon as possible.
89	I will be out of the office on Friday but will return on Monday.
89	I really need to get deals moved to these books by the end of next week.
89	Please let me know if there is anything I need to do to help.
89	Thanks as always.

91	Jay, There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.
91	I wanted you to buy more of the existing mutual funds.
91	Also, I am going to write a check out of my CMA account for more than the current cash balance.
91	Do I need to sell some mutual fund shares?
91	Or is it automatic?
91	Let me know.
91	Nice game in Palo Alto.
91	Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.
91	DG
92	Susan, Attached is the completed book request form.
92	I just want to clarify a few things.
92	The first three books are for Tagg.
92	The last two are for Sitara.
92	I will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.
92	Do you do this?
92	Or can you point me in the right direction.
92	I really need this completed by the end of the week.
92	Let me know if there is something else I need to do.
92	Thanks for your help.

94	Enron North America Corp.
95	Regina, I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.
95	The region can be called Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.
95	They are part of the other Chicago books: Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.
95	I have attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.
95	Let me know if there is anything else I need to do.
95	I want to make sure that the books are not only in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.
95	Thanks so much for your help.
95	DG 3-9573
96	The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name change.
96	It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.
96	If this has caused a problem, let me know.
96	I didn't think that just changing the deal number would have this effect.
96	Thanks.
96	DG 3-9573 Enron Global Finance
97	Scott, Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name while retaining the other books already set up.
97	This counterparty name Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.
97	But wants to be able to differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest.
97	Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem.
97	Thanks.
97	DG 3-9573
98	Steve, Congratulations.
98	Welcome back.
98	I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the deals we have booked in our system.
98	I was trying to reconcile them to your list of deals.
98	I could not.
98	But I think the best thing to do is to simply start over and book the deals you tell me to.
98	I just need the exact terms.
98	I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you get a chance, please give me a call.
98	Richard wants me to have these deals valued by the end of this month's P&L.
98	Thanks.
98	DG
99	Genaro, The Sitara was not updated for Aug. I just corrected Sitara.

102	I was getting the tickets out last night so I wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the airport, not the office.
102	So I'll call you when I get in later this afternoon.
102	I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that they get lost in the Enron building.
102	I hope you travel via 290 to Austin because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and you could pick them up on you way out.
102	I also have a couple of EndZone passes with the tickets.
102	Sorry for the screw-up.
102	I'll talk to you this afternoon.
102	DG
103	I think you forgot to attach the file.
103	Send it to Kevin.
103	I spoke with him about your questions.
103	DG
104	Unbelievable!
105	Don't worry about it.
105	If you can't go, you can't go.
105	You are not going to pay for the tickets if you don't use them.
105	Hope you feel better.
105	DG
106	I'm in Chicago right now.
106	I'll get with you on Monday.

108	I thought you might like this.
108	DG
109	Jeremy, I want to move all deals currently in the INTRA-EMWMEH book into the FT-IM-ENOV book.
109	Attached is a forwards detail by risk of the deals in question.
109	Let me know if you have any further questions.
109	I need this done this week if possible.
109	Thanks.
109	DG 3-9573
110	Regina, As we discussed yesterday, I need access to West deals in Sitara.
110	At a mininum I still need access to all Chicago/Midwest deals also.
110	Thanks.
110	DG 3-9573
111	It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.
111	Take a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a similar manner.
111	If you have any questions, please let me know.
111	Thanks.
111	DG
112	I'm with you.
112	I told my wife I thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 49 point margin is unacceptable.
112	I was at the game and it was as if the Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.
112	They were out of position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.
112	I like Brown and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to coach.
112	I lay this all at his feet.
112	Obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well.
112	I really don't know what to expect for the remainder of the season.
112	They obviously are not as bad as they showed on Saturday.
112	But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated.
112	I was very wrong.
112	Something has to change.
112	The fact is they are 3-5 in the last 8 games.
112	And were favored in all but one.
112	Lack of talent is no longer an excuse.
112	I think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this Saturday.
112	If they play as poorly as they have all season (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of the question.
112	For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game of Brown's tenure at UT.
112	What do you think?
113	Mike, How goes it?
113	I was thinking about you guys this weekend.
113	We were in town for the game (if you want to call it a game).
113	We ended up staying at a friends place.
113	I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't seen you on this particular weekend.
113	We are still plugging along.
113	How about you?
113	I thought I heard you were buying a new house.
113	Is that right?
113	Well, I just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message from Sean.
113	We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.
113	I can't believe it has been 4 years since we were up there.
113	Take care.
113	DG
114	Lets try to get together this week if possible.
114	Kyle wants to go as well.
114	Let me know.
114	DG
115	Lets do it on Friday DG
116	Chuck - I am now working on the West desk.
116	In the future you can send these requests to Scott.
116	DG
117	The date is good for the West desk.
117	I will forward a headcount later today.
117	DG 3-9573
118	Let me know sometime today if you want to do this.
118	DG 3-9573
119	Put the West desk down for 5 people.
119	DG 3-9573
120	Are we still on?
120	Where do you want to go?
120	I was thinking Mexican, but let me know what you think.
120	DG 713-853-9573
121	Mike, The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is that the postid in question did not have a net position.
121	The procedure Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports we run using Excel queries.
121	If a postid has a net position and is not officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.
121	It will not, however, if the postid does not have a position.
121	I understand the importance of officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.
121	Thanks.
121	DG 3-9573
122	Have you seen this?
122	It's from Kevin, an Aggie.
123	Scott, These places carry the Onkyo receiver.
123	I don't think they carry Polk, but ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.
123	The place I got mine from a couple of years ago no longer carries them.
123	I'm still looking.
123	Lee's Audio & Video have the Onkyo listed at $629.
123	Their sight is at leesvideo.com J&R Music World 800-221-8180 Lee's Audio & Video 425-643-5555 DG
124	It should reference the EOL number.
124	It looks af if Kevin did not link it up.
124	I'll remind him.
124	DG
125	Kevin, Please remember to link up all deals.
125	By this, I mean Tagg numbers in Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL numbers in Tagg.
125	I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.
125	You need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.
125	Thanks.
125	DG
126	Mike, We are currently looking into a query which will allow us to see all of our officialized books each night.
126	It is not ready now, but should be soon.
126	I'll let you know.
126	DG 3-9573
127	Please make sure we stay off the "list".
127	Thanks.
127	DG
128	Try this and see if it does any good.
128	DG
129	I don't think I am in the market for any stereo equipment.
129	But I was thinking about trying to sell that land we apparently have through mom.
129	What do you think?
129	I will never use it.
129	Let me know.
129	DG
130	Gather this info when you get a chance and give it to me.
130	Thanks.
130	DG
131	The macro in this file will query all official books for given Portfolio and Book codes.
131	Use it to make sure all your postid's that need to be, are officialized each night.
131	Thanks.
131	DG
132	I will be there.
132	Thanks.
132	DG 3-9573
133	Jeff, If we give these reviews in late Jan or Feb of next year, I think I could review Chris, Jason, Anne, and Jennifer.
133	I don't think I should review Dawn, Greg, or Kim.
133	Although, if I were in their shoes, I would want you involved in some capacity.
133	What do you think?
133	DG 3-9573 Enron North America Corp.
134	Put me down as primary with no secondary contact.
134	Thanks.] DG 3-9573
135	Greg, I have some tickets available for the Missouri game at face value.
135	Do you want any?
135	DG
136	Jeremy, Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.
136	I would like to move them all to the GD-NEW book.
136	I don't want to change any price or basis portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.
136	Please let me know if you can do this.
136	If you have any further questions, please call.
136	Thanks.
136	DG 3-9573
137	Sharon, I have the support you requested.
137	I am at EB3262B.
137	DG 3-9573
138	Jeremy, I have added two curves in Publ Names: WY/WELLHEAD and WY/MKTZONE.
138	They are in curveview.
138	Please add them to Tagg.
138	Call me if you have any questions.
138	Thanks.
138	DG 3-9573
139	Doug, The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of each deal in Tagg.
139	Do you have access to Tagg Deal Capture?
139	The Sitara numbers are 344737 (NS3520) and 344952&343785 (NS4159).
139	If you don't know where to look for these, let me know.
139	They were both available in the systems.
139	DG 3-9573
140	Jeremy, I need to have access to calc all books on a minibook level.
140	Please let me know if you need any further information.
140	Also, how my proposed index book move coming along?
140	Thanks.
140	DG 3-9573
141	We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books.
141	Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.
141	You don't need to request minibook access individually.
141	I have, so if needed we can run them on my machine.
141	Thanks.
141	DG 3-9573
142	Burton, Call if you have any further questions.
142	DG 3-9573
143	I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.
143	The reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question is 06/00.
143	When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price.
143	And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct.
143	Please let me know what you find out.
143	Thanks.
143	DG 3-9573
144	This book is for the West desk.
144	Please call if you have any questions.
145	You can start asking me about the West desk.
145	We don't have any new books for this month.
145	DG 3-9573
146	What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?
146	Either at night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.
146	Maybe four times a week.
146	Running and some weights in the garage.
146	I would really like to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this.
146	I love you.
147	I thought you might like this.
147	Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?
147	I don't think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.
147	We pretty much rule anyone out without prior experience unless they are internal candidates.
147	However, I have forwarded her resume to Settlements and Volume Management.
147	I think she should get a call from them.
147	How's life in Dallas?
147	Also, what is your new cell number.
147	The Houston Cellular number no longer works.
147	DG
148	This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.
148	Neither the Sitara or EOL number is in Tagg.
148	Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.
148	It is very important that you always put this information in Tagg.
148	In addition, make sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.
148	Thanks.
148	DG
149	Here's what happened.
150	I think it will be a very close game.
150	Except for the fart against Colorado, you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.
150	OU is obviously a very good team.
150	But I think more importantly, they are just playing great football.
150	They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.
150	When the QB heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, the football Gods are smiling on you big time.
150	But regardless, you've got to admire Stoops and the job he has done.
150	They have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country.
150	And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above average team.
150	They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.
150	They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best team in the country) good team they have played.
150	And lost to a bad Stanford team.
150	But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a T+1 win.
150	But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.
150	But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.
150	They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.
150	DG
151	Kathy, I don't think I will be able to make our meeting tomorrow.
151	Can we pick it up again next week?
151	Thanks.
151	DG
152	What time are you arriving on Friday?
152	We got box seats to the Bears game on Sunday.
152	DG
153	Hector, I don't believe I am set up to review as a supervisor in the PEP system.
153	How do I get this changed in the system?
153	Let me know.
153	Thanks DG
154	Please add Carole Frank to the list.
154	Her NT username is cfrank2.
154	Thanks.
154	DG 3-9573
155	How was your morning?
155	I hope not too bad.
155	I didn't get to sleep until 3am.
155	I miss you and love you.
156	Will you two please get this info to Dutch.
156	Thanks.
156	DG
157	I can't remember if I forwarded this to you already.
157	Thanks.
157	DG
158	I am in Chicago today and tomorrow.
158	I will look at this more while I am here.
158	DG
159	Let's make sure we are doing this every night.
159	I think Jason has been running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last person finished do it every day.
159	I sure can crank out the emails when I get some uninterrupted time to myself!
159	DG
160	Jeremy, I don't have access to run this book.
160	Will you please get me authorization?
160	Thanks.
160	DG
161	We are flying in on Thursday.
161	We plan on renting a car and driving to your place.
161	I'll update you on specific times early next week.
161	Because me and the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on the same flight that the three of us are on.
161	We are all looking forward to seeing you.
161	DG
162	Thanks.
162	You can tell Phillip I'll have it fixed when I return on Monday.
162	DG
163	The first email was what I sent to Burton and Susan.
163	This is the confirmation from them that the book was set up.
163	DG 3-9573
164	Hector, Kimberly S. Olinger is listed as reporting to me in the PEP system.
164	She should be moved to Jeff Gossett.
164	Thanks.
164	DG Enron North America Corp.
165	On election day, you have to vote in your own precinct.
165	You need to find your precinct number and then you can find the location on the web.
165	DG
166	Sharon, I missplaced the info we were speaking about yesterday.
166	Please send it to me again so I can follow up.
166	Thanks.
166	DG
167	Jeremy, I can calc postids for FT-NW but cannot print.
167	Please help.
167	Thanks.
167	DG 3-9573
168	The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.
168	Because of work commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.
168	The 3 of us will get a rental car and make our way to your place.
168	Are you going to be home then?
168	Then we will go pick up Kristi later.
168	We have no plans at the moment (other than going to the game on Saturday).
168	We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, though, 6:30am.
168	They didn't give me many options using reward travel.
168	We are all looking forward to the trip.
168	See you on Thursday.
168	DG
169	I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.
169	We are arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.
169	Other than the game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.
169	See you soon.
169	DG
170	Sharon, We Schedule C'd the $50M difference.
170	Let me know if you need further info or backup.
170	Thanks.
170	DG 3-9573
171	Please get this info to me and I will pass it on to AA.
171	Thanks.
171	DG
172	One more for you.
172	Because you're special.
172	DG
173	Me and the kids get in at 10am, Kristi has to stay a little later for work and will be in at 3pm.
173	I was also thinking we could buy tickets at the stadium.
173	Don't worry about not taking time off.
173	See you Thursday.
173	DG
174	I see Jennifer Bagwell in the system, but not Christopher Walker.
174	DG 3-9573
175	Will, Jennifer Bagwell Jason Wolfe Chris Walker Anne Bike Carole Frank DG
176	Don't worry about picking us up at the airport.
176	I will be careful and brave the elements.
176	See you tomorrow.
176	DG
177	It's done.
177	I appologize for this taking so long.
177	It won't happen again.
177	DG 3-9573
178	Yes DG
179	Connie, I appologize for the tardiness of this list.
179	I was out of the office last Thursday and Friday.
179	Please call if you have any questions.
179	DG 3-9573
180	Connie, I believe I misinterpreted your request.
180	I have updated the list to include every book we officialize each night.
180	DG 3-9573
181	OK, so the classes start this week.
181	The first one will be on what to look for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.
181	Will Kelly and I will present the class.
181	We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the most beneficial part will be individual questions.
181	So bring them if you have them.
181	We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.
181	Our breakout is as follows: Carole Jennifer Jason Anne Chris Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 11:30am.
181	We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.
181	Thanks.
181	DG
182	Susan, I believe this is all of the Enovate/EMW books that are officialized each night.
182	Call me with any questions.
182	DG 3-9573
183	Here is another one.
183	It will be another Chicago book.
183	We will never officialize the book.
183	Thanks.
183	DG 3-9573
184	I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.
184	We had a great time.
184	Only wish we could have stayed longer.
184	It was cold but the game was fun.
184	It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they did.
184	We will try and make it a regular trip.
184	We also spoke about maybe getting together in Dallas sometime next year.
184	I need to go, but will talk to you later.
185	Eric, I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.
185	I talked to ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.
185	She does not specifically know about the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of a reserve behind the scenes.
185	I don't know for sure, but this has to be how the $ got in the West P&L.
185	It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).
185	I hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.
185	She ran the transport book at that time.
185	The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are booked correctly in Sitara.
185	EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.
185	However, the end date remains '08 in Sitara.
185	I don't know why the term was changed.
185	I have meetings almost all day.
185	I will still try and investigate, but I know you were looking for some answers today.
185	You may want to try and get in touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.
185	DG 3-9573
186	Put me down for the 15th also.
186	Thanks.
186	DG 3-9573 Enron North America Corp.
187	I am still trying to recruit.
187	It seems everyone is out of town that weekend.
187	When is the deadline?
187	Let me know.
187	Oh, I almost forgot, Congratulations!!
187	DG
188	We would love to do this.
189	I relpied to mom already, but thought you would want to see it.
190	Daniel, I show a net open position of (15.9) contracts.
190	DG 3-9573
191	In addition: expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - checking the OA Flash tab.
191	I am sure there are some others.
191	DG
192	P&L is OK.
192	Open position is 39.0 contracts.
192	DG
193	Kathy, I tried calling but could not get you or your voicemail.
193	Tomorrow is the first day of bidweek and I also have some other meetings to attend.
193	I think we need to skip this week and pick up next Tuesday.
193	Sorry for the inconvenience.
193	DG
194	Russell, Here are our portfolio and book codes: Port Book L A P A Call me if you have any questions.
194	DG 3-9573
195	Done.
195	I did the 1999 changes as well.
195	DG 3-9573
196	Uncle Clark, It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.
196	All four of us had a great time.
196	It was so good to see all of you and especially great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.
196	I really regret that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).
196	But even given that, I feel as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's like we have always spent alot of time together.
196	I guess that's why they call it family.
196	So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.
197	Russ, I got this from Regina just before she changed groups.
197	DG 3-9573
198	Russell, These are all of our book names: For Basis, add -BAS to the end of the book name.
198	For Gas Daily, add -GDL to the end of the book name.
198	Call me if you have any questions.
198	DG 3-9573
199	I'll try and find out today.
200	I hope you have a good day back at school.
200	I love you.
201	We'll see you there.
201	DG 3-9573
202	I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was going to be free on Saturday.

214	Shelly, I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.
214	I am the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.
214	I think a Book Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.
214	We have had success in with Analysts in our group.
214	I think it presents a good opportunity for them as well.
214	Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential candidates.
214	I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.
214	Thanks for your help.
214	DG 3-9573
215	You're welcome.
215	I had a good time also.
215	We should play again sometime when it's not so damn cold.
215	Looks like you were right about OU.
215	I really thought they would lose to KState.
215	DG
216	First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.
216	They keep proving me wrong.
216	Second, sorry this is late.
216	Friday was 1st day, our longest of the month.
216	DRAFT This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine Currently there are 5 deals in Tagg and 1 in the transport model.
216	EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the West desk EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will not let us out of the firm contract EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ???
216	will reveal details not known at this point in time (Bid/Offer) Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 thru Oct-23 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued at approx $12M in the West Desk After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder will be granted out in orig.
216	This is my first go at it.
216	Let me know of any revisions you want.
216	DG 3-9573
217	I saw that about Mackovic - He's a good fit in the Pac10.
217	Who do you take in the Orange Bowl?
217	FSU is -11.
217	That sure seems like alot of points.
217	DG
218	Kathy, Attached are two files: a mini-book of EC3952.O run for Nov-08 thru Oct-23 and a copy of the deal in the transport model.
218	The file is too large to email.
218	There are two tabs: the first contains deal terms and the second is a copy of the P&L sheet as of 12/4/2000.
218	Call me with any questions you may have.

219	I will be at the dinner tonight.

220	I vote for next week.
220	And since I didn't get involved in the prior discussion, I think a class on craps is in order.
220	DG
221	Pull this together and then call Sharon so they can come get the copies.
221	Thanks.
221	DG
222	We want to, but I'm not willing to put up the cash.
222	I'm also thinking how mad I'd be if I did spend the $ and we got punked.
222	DG
223	It was good.
223	There were about 20.
223	It took too long, we didn't leave until 10pm.
223	They sure can spend the $ DG Enron Capital Management
224	Dawn, Jay and Randy are on the list, but I left them blank.
224	I also populated Paul Lucci and the Chicago traders.

235	Thanks for the info and letting us slide one in. DG 3-9573
236	I want to run something by you.
236	It sounds like we have some sort of budget for Friday night.
236	I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it all.
236	I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am willing to pay for her.
236	I would like to do the same for everyone else, but don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a little $$.
236	Let me know what you think.
236	Thanks.
236	DG 3-9573
237	I just would not want to be the only person to bring someone.
237	So if we don't offer this to everyone, I won't bring her.
237	I don't have a problem with it, just wanted to see what you thought.
237	DG Enron North America Corp.
238	We released more tonight.

239	Dawn, Kam is out so I checked for Central also.
239	DG
240	Quick, give me a cheap stock that looks promising.

241	DG
242	Thanks.
242	Bought Travelocity.com.
242	I had some extra cash sitting around in my DG
243	I watched the second half.
243	He is a stud.
243	Westlake actually had a good defense also.
243	I think he wast the first back to run for 100 yds.
243	We know some people from Midland.
243	They say he is a gangsta.
243	But they also say Roy Williams is a great kid.
243	Thanks for the info yesterday.
243	DG
244	Please read.
244	DG
245	Dawn, The deals look good in both Tagg and Sitara, but the link field in Tagg has not been populated with the Sitara number.

251	It would help if I attached the file.

252	I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.
252	The automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of time; especially during bidweek.
252	I know there are others who deserve thanks in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as well.
252	I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.
252	When do you think we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?
252	Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?
252	Thanks again.
252	DG 3-9573
253	OK
254	Happy Holidays!
254	It looks like we will be going skiing in Colorado from March 11-16.
254	I wanted to see if you were going to be in town during that time and see if we could come by and see you.
254	It would most likely be on the 10th and then the 16th.
254	We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru Thursday night.
254	Let me know.
254	I hope Santa was good to you all.
254	DG
255	Jim, I didn't top level that amount tonight.
255	The Central desk has the other side of the transaction and if I backed your portion out, then the loss would be double counted.
255	It will correct itself tomorrow.

299	I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.
299	And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD changer.
299	I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 range.
299	It is also huge.
299	I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you know of the downside.
299	Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an issue.

325	Jay, I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously discussed.
325	It is effective Feb 20th.
325	I need to change the amount transferred to account 586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 from $175 to $200.
325	I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA account.
325	I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and account 586-94019.
325	This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.
325	Let me know if I need to do anything else.
325	Also, when are the recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?
325	I will need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.
325	Call me if you have any questions.
325	Thanks.
325	DG
326	Yes we did.
326	DG
327	Shawn, Unfortunately, I am out of the office this morning with a sick kid.
327	I will not be able to make the 10:30am interview.
327	I appologize for the short notice.
327	DG
328	Troy, I'm out of the office this morning.
328	I'll get back to you later about the variance.
328	But just so you know, Kevin's reported P&L was understated by the $188K on the OA Flash tab.
328	He made an error in the sharing calculation.
328	DG
329	I think everyone got the list.
329	Make sure we are using it.
329	Thanks.
329	I should be in later this afternoon.
329	DG
330	Rick, Unfortunately, I had to cancel.
330	I had a sick kid and just made it into the office.
330	DG
331	Jim called me about this and I asked him to email me.
331	But all these storage facilities are on the East desk.
331	DG
332	Joe, Call Pat Ryder for West desk requests.
332	DG
333	I will be able to interview at either time.
333	I selected the late time on the email, but wanted to respond to make sure you received it.
333	DG
334	I received the item.
334	DG
335	How are you feeling?
335	I'm very tired and stiff.
335	I've been thinking, and I know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes to $.
335	So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes to financing.
335	I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.
335	And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know that I value your judgement and ideas.
335	Have a great day.
335	As always, I love you very much.
336	It's a funny joke, but obviously not written by a married guy!
336	DG
337	Jay, Give me a mutual fund to buy for the Ed IRA accounts.
337	DG
338	I just looked at their sight.
338	They seem like a reputable company.
338	It's a store in Manhattan, NY.
338	The only thing to be concerned about when ordering by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.
338	It is more of a pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best Buy.
338	But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.
338	I'd pull the trigger, that's a great price.
338	DG
339	Chris, I'm sure there are some I missed.
339	I beleive some of these books have not been used for quite some time.
339	Let me know what else you need from me.
339	Thanks.
339	DG
340	Hey, Brent has started a softball team to play on Sunday evenings.
340	He wants to know if you are interested.
340	DG
341	I just approved the 13th and 14th.
341	DG
342	We are taking a hit of $28,900,000 on tonight's P&L for Dec-00 production.
342	DG
343	How goes it?
343	I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for March.
343	I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the four of us.
343	He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying with us.
343	I hope this is OK.
343	He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out one night.
343	Let me know.
343	Also, I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad school.
343	He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.
343	Talk to you soon.
343	DG
344	Yes DG
345	I have 3 new employees and they are working on the first unit.
345	My 3 existing employees are working on their second and third.
345	So far so good.
345	I think it is good that we have put the responsibility on them to learn the material.
345	I have not heard of any negative response.
345	I'll keep you posted.
345	DG
346	Sheri, We are going to NO for JazzFest at the end of April.
346	April 27th-29th to be exact.
346	Let me know if you're going.
346	DG
347	We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).
347	We will stay that night and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.
347	We will return to Denver on Friday the 16th and stay the night.
347	Our plane back to Houston is early Saturday morning.
347	We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.
347	I think we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within 15 miles).
347	How's the weather in Denver these days?
347	We look forward to seeing the two of you.
347	Thanks.
347	DG
348	If you have any questions about this let me know.
348	It will be a pain in the ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to manage.
348	There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.
348	Again, let me know if you need anything.
348	DG
349	I will attend DG
350	Please make sure this guy gets what he needs.
350	Thanks.
350	DG
351	Chris, We are taking $100M to Schedule C tonight.
351	I don't know when it may be released.
351	DG
352	This deal is related to the long term transportation that was sold to Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin.
352	DG
353	Please take care of this if you have any to be flipped.
353	Thanks.
353	DG
354	Please read DG
355	We are removing the $100M from Schedule C that was put there on Friday.
355	DG
356	I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.
356	It was selfish and I sincerely appologize.
356	I don't know what I was thinking or why.
356	Well, I just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.
356	Even though you may not believe it.
356	I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.
356	I love you very much, and will call you later.
357	Get this to Jim.
357	DG
358	Sean, I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of Granby, CO. It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south of Granby along Hwy 40.
358	We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night (11th) thru Thursday night (15th).
358	I indicated we would like to go to Winter Park because we have been there and it is close.
358	We want to ski 2 days in Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.
358	If you can make it during the week to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.
358	I would love to go to an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on Sunday.
358	Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.
358	That's pretty late so we may or may not be able to do anything that night.
358	We will leave on Sunday (11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).
358	Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.
358	If you can get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.
358	Thanks for all your hospitality.
358	See you soon.
358	DG
359	No, we will go to Keystone instead of WP.
359	We are paying either way, and so it doesn't matter to me.
359	Also, I have never been to Keystone and would like to go.
359	And I will have a rental car.
359	We are looking forward to seeing you.
359	DG
360	Mike, This is the email from Bryce, who is the Manager of physical gas settlements.
360	Attached is my summary for the West.
360	DG
361	Thanks.
361	I noticed Lisa indicated that Linda was getting additional info.
361	Is it ready?
361	Mike Grigsby, who is the head physical trader on the desk asked about Tenaska.
361	He thinks that they also charged us.
361	Please let me know.
361	Thanks again.
361	DG
362	I do DG
363	OK, that's funny.
363	DG
364	Jennifer, Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.

376	Yes we did.
376	We had a great time.
376	I heard Christine is pregnant again.
376	How are you doing?
376	After a week off, I realize how much work sucks!
376	DG

384	Thanks.

385	Jennifer, NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to NGI-SOCAL.
385	This curve will probably show up every month because the West Coast is very volitile.
385	The change is due to a change in the market.
385	IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.
385	The change is also due to market changes that drove up the curve.
385	Call me if you have any questions.

398	Here it is.
398	Let me know if you have any questions.
398	DG
399	Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?
399	Who is confused?
399	Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?
399	I don't want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.
399	Let me know what you think.

402	We need to get together for lunch again.
402	Can you on Friday?
402	DG
403	Irena, One thing that would help me out the most is when new people start in the group, we have all of their applications and passwords ready to go.
403	Other than that, I think you guys do a great job.
403	Thanks.
403	DG
404	I won't blame you if you don't get that requested info to me.
404	I migrated to Windows 2000 and it had an old address book.
404	Sorry.
404	DG
405	No, I sent the email to you by mistake.
405	We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.
405	How do you know her?
405	Is it through Dawn?
405	When Sheri sent the message to everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't pick up, and I didn't leave a message.
405	DG
406	We granted a total of $320K ($220K to you and $100K to credit reserve) by mistake.
406	We will take the extra $100K in orig from you tonight.
406	I appologize for the error.
406	DG
407	I changed the deal to $14,028 DG
408	We are updating the pricing today.
408	I'll let you know when it's finished.
408	DG
409	You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good.
409	I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.
409	You can also just put your own package together.
409	If you do this make sure the speakers are of the same brand.
409	This is what I did for Scott.
409	Many of the speaker packages use 5 small speakers and a sub.
409	But I suggested larger front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.
409	Any decent receiver will have a decoder built in. And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on how much you are willing to spend.
409	I'll go through my stash of magazines tonight and see what I can find for you to read.
409	DG
410	Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.
410	I actually have already done this on the web.
410	What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase of APGCX for $340 begining this month.
410	Also, any idea if I am going to receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?
410	I noticed online that the Roths are now zero.
410	Thanks.

414	The NYMEX was closed on Friday so I was off.
414	We can try this week if you're available.

415	No interns.
415	As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August.
415	I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new.
415	I do like having analysts though and think we would rather be long than short.

416	Greg, Transport Deals/Transport Model Excel, Access, Pub Posting, TDS) These are mostly basic.
416	DG
417	Jeff, I think Risk can do two things to improve the process: have more of us involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.
417	This last one I am particularly bad about.
417	I will see a variance that is rather small and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.
417	I think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in preventing problems rather than just identifying them.
417	But I know that is easier said than done.
417	DG
418	Done DG
419	Mom, Are you leaving on Saturday or Sunday?

422	Kristi said you called on Saturday.
422	I was golfing.
422	What did you think about the draft?
422	I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.
422	Everyone seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.
422	As long as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.
422	But what do I know?
422	DG
423	Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.
423	I really can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.
423	I won't offer an excuse.
423	Guys on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.
423	But the worst part is, I didn't realize what I had done until later the next day.
423	It was disrespectful and I sincerely apologize.
423	I do have a conflict tomorrow.
423	And I will understand if you want to stop the sessions.
423	Thanks.
423	DG
424	Jennifer, The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of March compared to February.
424	That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and NGI-PGE CG.
424	As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.
424	Other Rocky Mountain points were similar.
424	Please call if you have any further questions.
424	DG
425	Sorry.
425	I just did.
425	DG
426	I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.
426	His answer was the same.

433	Have you seen any of the sights yet?
433	I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we are in Chicago.
433	I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me know.
433	They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.
433	We leave Wed night and return Sun morning.
433	It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and getting them to school.

450	I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood.
450	I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon.
450	These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer.
450	The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver.
450	And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price.
450	The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com.
450	You also need to look at audioreview.com.
450	You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased.
450	It is a great site.
450	They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid.
450	On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone.
450	They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet.
450	Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.
450	I leave for Chicago later this afternoon.
450	DG
451	It's good to hear from you.
451	The game is November 10th.
451	And we hope you come down, it would be alot of fun.
451	We are getting ready to go to Disney World on Saturday.
451	The kids are pumped.
451	First I guess you should see if I'm the coverage area.
451	We are at: 14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
451	Right now, we just have dial-up internet service and a local calling company that also gives us 100 minutes of long-distance.
451	We get off pretty cheap on this, but I would be willing to give this ION a try.
451	Let me know.
451	DG
452	To be consistent, make the FT books ENA - FT West Keystone, etc...
452	DG
453	I heard you had an email address and wanted to see if it worked.
453	How are things.
453	We are pretty wet here, I've heard you are as well.
453	We got back from Disney World last week.
453	Things are OK here.
453	The kids are excited about summer.
453	They will probably get in the pool everyday.
453	More to follow.
453	Try and stay dry.
453	DG
454	I'm sure you know by know, but Houston got it pretty bad over the weekend.
454	We were OK, but the flooding was unbelievable.
454	We were at Lake Conroe (K's parents live on the lake) on Friday night.
454	It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.
454	My boat is on a lift out of the water.
454	In the morning it was floating.
454	Their dock is underwater.
454	I've never seen anything like it.
454	I hope everyone over there is alright.
454	Have you seen the newest edition?
454	We hope to get down your way sometime this summer.
454	Until then stay dry and take care.
454	DG
455	Kristi wants to know if you are still willing to have the kids for a week in July.
455	If so, we need to make plans.
455	Let us know.
455	DG
456	Please call us ASAP regarding the possible trip to Georgia for the kids.
456	We are looking at July 23rd or 24th and returning July 28th.
456	But we need to talk to you.
456	Home 281-304-8303 DG
457	Jim, After our conversation on the phone yesterday, I confirmed that we are not able to provide delivered gas at the citygate for a competitive price.
457	Therefore we do not wish to make an offer of this package at this time.
457	Thanks for your consideration.
457	Sincerely,
458	I may be in Austin later this summer.
458	I'm in no hurry to get the tickets.
458	If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.
458	Thanks.
458	DG
459	How goes it?
459	I hope good.
459	I just found out that Enron is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.
459	Isn't this the group you are working for now?
459	They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).
459	Do you have this?
459	If so, how do you like it?
459	Did you hear about Jessie?
459	Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.
459	I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.
459	Take Care.
459	DG
460	FYI...My latest check stub does not reflect a change in pay.
460	DG
461	Reminder to get me set up as an authorized user.
461	DG
462	A lady walked into a pharmacy & spoke to the Pharmacist...........
462	She asked: "Do you have viagara?"
462	"Why yes," he answered.............
462	She asked, "Does it work?"
462	"Why yes!!!!!!!"
462	He answered.
462	"Can you get it over the counter?"
462	she asked......
462	"I can if I take two," he answered.
463	It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.
463	I'll probably just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.
463	I will verify this with you next week.
463	I can't believe the season is already upon us.
463	Any word on OU?
463	Thanks DG
464	If you can FedEx them, that would be great: Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street Thanks.
464	DG
465	Attached is ENA's proposal for the Nov-Mar Ventura gas package as requested.
465	Please call if you have any questions or concerns.
465	Thanks.
466	Attached is ENA's proposal for Package 3 (ANR SW) Nov-Mar supply.
466	Please call if you have any questions or concerns.
466	Thanks.
467	Thanks DG
468	I just got the tickets.
468	Thanks for sending them.
468	I paid for 4 OU tickets, could you only get me 2?
468	Let me know.
468	I also wanted to ask you about the possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.
468	I know you get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.
468	Thanks again.
468	DG
469	I believe it was $610.
469	That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).
469	The two I have are Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.
469	I meant season tix.
469	But would probably also try to get OU as well.
469	I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.
469	I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.
469	I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.
469	I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.
469	Let me know.
469	DG
470	I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.
470	So just disregard that suggestion.
470	I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term.
470	Because I will commit to purchase the current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.
470	It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.
470	I'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself.
470	How did you end up with so many?
470	Is Mark still getting the two next to mine?
470	Just curious.
470	Don't worry about the OU tix, I will find you on Saturday.
470	Thanks as always.
470	DG
471	I am happy with my seats.
471	I just wanted to make sure you were willing to continue allowing me to buy them through you long term.
471	See you Saturday.
471	They should be pretty good this year.
471	But I've certainly heard that before!
471	DG
472	You're welcome.
472	It's really no problem at all.
472	I want to see them succeed.
472	DG
473	Here it is.
473	Let me know what you think.
473	DG
474	Thanks.
474	DG
475	DG
476	Kristi work: kristi.giron@cfisd.net
477	They are going to install the system on 9/29 (9am-11am).
477	My brother-in-law got it recently and seems to like it.
477	He lives even further away from the city than me, so it should be OK.
477	See ya.
477	DG
478	Do you have any xtras for the above referenced.
478	I'm just looking for one for Tech, but as many as 6 for Kansas.
478	Thanks.
478	DG
479	More than 6,000 (more than 4,000 American citizens) innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life.
479	If that is not worth fighting for, then what in your opinion is?
479	I will admit, I am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues.
479	I am glad that life in our country allows for dissent.
479	But I think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice.
479	I honestly believe that if we do not respond, and with calculated deadly force, that we ultimately lose.
479	And I am not talking about losing a war, but our freedom.
479	I agree with you that war will bring unintended consequenses, but these consequences in my opinion, are the price we must pay to defend our way of life.
480	Congratulations on the latest member of the family.
480	Kim sent me an email with website address that has the pictures.
480	I hope everyone is doing well.
480	Take care.
480	DG
481	Let me know what you think.
481	Please add any changes you want.
481	DG
482	Irena, Please print the attached file on Enron letterhead and give it to Carole.
482	Thanks.
482	DG
483	Thank you.
483	That was quick.
483	DG
484	I would like to know my seat location when it has been assigned.
484	I ordered 4 tickets.
484	Thanks.
485	I remembered to bring them.
485	Maybe we can get together later today.
485	DG
486	I love you,
487	10/12/01 ABC Beverages ($24.37) 10/11/01 New York Pizza ($14.50)
488	Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.
488	I will be in the great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.
488	If I was going, it would be Zydeco all the way!
488	DG
489	Anne, It looks like Crosstimbers had a phys trade with us at NWPL Rox + $.025 and they also had fin trades (Nymex and Basis).
489	We combined them to essentially make Jan01 a fixed price deal.
489	It appears the customer is questioning this.
489	Why they are 8 months after settlement date, I have no idea.
489	I already spoke with Carole about this and she has the deal tickets but if you have any questions, just ask.
489	Megan, Anne should be able to explain this to you.
489	She runs the West desk now.
489	DG
490	Diane, Heartland Energy Group, Inc. We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3 Twister Gas Services, LLC This is more complicated.
490	We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.
490	We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).
490	They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7 I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.
490	They want one similar to this for these two deals.
490	Please call if you have any questions.
490	I appreciate your help.
490	DG
491	I leave Thurs morning and return Friday night.
491	I don't know why I typed Friday.
491	DG
492	About a third, that's why I'm being shipped to OK.
492	DG
493	That sounds very bad.
493	Did I read that correctly?
493	It basically says that the series is on the brink of collapse.
493	DG
494	Thanks.
494	We had a great time and are already looking forward to Jazz Fest.
494	DG
495	The current exemption is $675,000.
495	So that means that the first $675,000 of an estate is tax free.
495	Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.
495	So the effective rate will be a little lower.
495	The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.
495	This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.
495	Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.
495	I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.
495	Chris loves it when you are at his games.
495	He was pretty proud of his play at second base.
496	Maybe you should stump for president of the series.
496	Actually, that would be a great job.
496	You couldn't do much worse, it seems.
496	DG
497	I don't mean to hound you, but the customer is asking.
497	Any luck on completing this?
497	Please let me know.
497	Thanks DG
498	Thanks.
498	DG
499	I have to leave the office early for a trip with Bryant and won't be back until Monday.
499	DG
500	I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.
500	For Twister, the payment we made on 9/26 ($116,700) corresponds to all five (three partial and two full) terminations.
500	DG
501	Thanks.
501	Did you get it signed?
501	DG
502	Looks like this was made more difficult than it needed to be.
502	The customer wanted a termination letter and because of this we need to kill these deals.
502	I should have just killed the deals in the first place.
502	Sorry for the extra work.
502	DG
503	Are you still planning to come down?
503	I need to get a head count because tickets are sometimes tough to come by.
503	Let me know.
503	DG
504	Will you please ask this person doing Diane's work if the termination letter was completed?
504	Thanks.
504	DG
505	14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
506	John, Per our phone conversation, here is how to get in touch with me.
506	I will follow up tomorrow with a quote.
506	Thanks.
506	Manager Telephone: 713-853-9573 Cellular: 832-524-6091 Fax: 713-646-8453 Email darron.c.giron@enron.com
507	I just wanted to remind you how much we love you and appreciate everything you do for us.
507	I hope you have a great day.
507	Only 6 more to go.
507	I saw where Sears is laying off over 4,900 salaried jobs.
507	I hope Jan is unaffected.
507	This economy really is starting to get me worried.
507	I love you.
508	I didn't go to Colorado.
508	My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.
508	They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.
508	But I'm not complaining.
508	I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.
508	He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.
508	I think the next three are locks.
508	Then it comes down to T+1.
508	I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).
508	Texas should be very good next year.
508	The only problem area I see is the OL.
508	I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.
508	Let's do it.
508	ENE is a piece of shit.
508	That's really all there is to say about that.
508	DG
509	John, Enron's NYMEZ offer for the following volume is $3.115: Contracts Total 630 As I stated in our phone conversation, this offer would be contingent on my ability to clear an internal hurdle.
509	We do not have an ISDA in place and I am waiting for a reply from our credit department on the best course of action to take.
509	Thanks for your consideration.
509	Sincerely,
510	I think Phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business.
510	Enron's stock is down sharply again today.
510	It's trading at $16.
510	Remember in March we got out at $71.
510	My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.
510	If I seem depressed lately, that's why.
510	Anyway, I love you.
511	I didn't have an exact email address for Kent, so I guessed.
511	kkopetzy@utilicorp.com It was just returned undeliverable.
511	Please forward the info to him.
511	Thanks.
511	DG
512	I just cancelled it.
512	We need to let people and companies that the address has changed.
513	Reagan, Lucy wanted me to let you know that I will be handling Utilicorp from the gas end.
513	It is a territorial issue.
513	I gave John a quote on the Cal 02 strip and am following up with credit because we don't have an ISDA in place with them.
513	Let me know if I can be of any assistance on your end.
513	Thanks.
513	DG
514	First, what the hell are you doing working at 12:09am?
514	Second, it obiously will, but to what extent I'm not sure yet.
514	See ya.
514	DG
515	Carol, Attached please find our proposal for your inquiry to purchase Nov01 baseload gas on Reliant.
515	Please call me if you have any questions or concerns.
515	Thanks.
516	Sorry it's late.
517	There are some pissed off people in this building.
517	The outlook I got this morning at a meeting is pretty fucking bleak.
517	Amazing.
517	DG
518	I aim to please.
518	I'll pay you in my Enron stock options.
518	DG
519	Carole, Attached please find my proposal to sell AEP on behalf of SWEPCO winter swing gas at Duke-Carthage.
519	If you have any questions or concerns, please call.
519	Thanks.
520	Carl, Although both dates will most likely work for me, I would prefer choice # 1: Nov 13th in the morning.
520	Thanks.
520	DG
521	OK.
521	Sometimes the CFISD mail server is very slow and messages get returned.
521	I'll tell her.
522	Diane, I have another termination for you.
522	We killed Y30499.1 and Y55771.1 and made a payment of $94,200 on 10/29/01 which is booked on Y30449.3.
522	Let me know if you need any additional information.
522	Thanks.
522	DG
523	I will attend.
523	I'm putting the finishing touches on the Powerpoint presentation as we speak.
523	Just make sure you brush up on off-balance sheet financing and limited partnerships..........
523	DG
524	I'm having lunch tomorrow with some college fraternity friends.
524	This is what they sent out to everyone.
524	DG
525	Oh, alright.
525	Dropped a check in the mail this morning.
525	When you get it pay no attenting to the white powdery substance..............
525	DG
526	Laura, I will be out of town this weekend.
526	Actually, in Chicago.
526	Sorry.
526	DG
527	The Kansas crew is not coming down for the game.
527	Can you still watch just our kids that Saturday?
527	Chris has his first playoff game tonight @ 6pm at the West Little York field.
528	I am in the process of transitioning into Bryant Frihart's area of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.
528	I also have just begun working in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Kansas.
528	Largest customers are Minnegasco, MUD, Great River.
528	Thanks.

529	Address to the hotel Driving directions from Midway
530	Sorry to hear that.
530	I hope everything goes well at work.
530	My company is crumbling.
530	It's pretty scary.
530	A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.
530	I ended up getting a cable modem.
530	I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.
530	And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.
530	DG
531	Carl, I see if I can pull this information together for you.
531	I'll let you know later today.
531	Thanks DG
532	It probably goes without saying, but just face for the two tix again.
532	DG
533	No. We are going up without tickets.
533	People who have been say there are usually plenty available.
533	Don't worry about the $.
533	I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.
533	The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.
533	But the fun thing about it is I really don't care who wins.
533	DG
534	Carl, I was traveling on Friday.
534	The Doubletree is the closest.
534	I'll get you a number.
534	Dinner on Monday is a good idea.
534	If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal.
534	DG
535	Doubletree Hotel Houston-Allen Center 400 Dallas Street
536	Laura, Will you try and carve out 15-20 minutes to talk about what's going on and what to expect?
536	Thanks.

537	Carl, These are the only hotels located in the downtown area: Doubletree Hotel Four Seasons Hotel Hyatt Regency Houston Crowne Plaza Downtown DG
538	What did you decide?
538	DG
539	I've got 2 in Sec 106 Row 25 @ face value if you're still interested.
539	DG
540	Thanks for the pictures.
540	I forwarded them to Kristi.
540	I hope everyone is well.
540	DG
541	I have 2 in Sec 106 Row 25 @ face value
542	I just sent you an email about 2 tickets @ face value.
542	This email address is at my place of work.
542	I'm leaving work early today so if you respond after around 2:00pm, send it to dgiron1@houston.rr.com.
542	That's my home email.
542	Thanks.
542	DG
543	Sorry to bombard you, but I forgot to mention that the tix will come with 2 wristbands to the EndZone club as well.
543	DG
544	Is Gary's company hiring?
544	DG
545	Yes, by Skilling mostly.
545	I can't believe that a handful of people brought the company all the way down to the point of bankruptcy.
545	Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, India, Azurix, etc...) I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.
545	I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.
545	I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.
545	Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.
545	DG
546	Carl, I was supposed to be traveling this morning, but because of the crash in NY it has been postponed to tomorrow.
546	I will be in a Dallas airport at the time of our call tomorrow morning.
546	Should I use 763-241-2490 as the number to use for our conference call?
546	If not, let me know.
546	I look forward to our conversation.
546	Thanks DG
547	Thanks Carl.
547	I'll call your number @ 10am tomorrow.
547	DG
548	I was sorry to hear about your mother.
548	I tried to call last night but you were not at home.
548	I told mom and she asked for your number.
548	I don't know if you have heard, but Enron was purchased by Dynegy on Friday.
548	The deal will not close until Q3 '02, but this will obviously affect me in some manner.
548	We will see.
548	Take care.
548	DG
549	Thanks.
549	I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.
549	I just talked to him.
549	Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.
549	I'm glad you like it over there.
549	I guess it's just wait and see.
549	DG
550	I was out of the office on Friday.
550	I'll call you later this morning with a quote.
550	Thanks.
550	DG
551	Birgit, Rather than respond to your questions, I would rather meet face to face.
551	When are you available?
551	Let me know.
551	Thanks DG
552	1pm is best for me.
552	DG
553	Maryland, Florida, Kansas, St. Joseph's, and Kentucky.
553	All Top 10.
553	All lost.
553	DG
554	Not anymore.
554	This is the ESPN poll.
554	Not AP.
554	DG
555	Patrick, Terry Brownrig and I did a small phys basis deal this afternoon.
555	It was 988/d ANR/SW we are selling @ NX1 - $.155 He called later saying he may want to also do a Jan02-Mar02 deal also.
555	This is just giving you a headsup for when he calls.
555	If so, you would need to get the quote from Andy.
555	Have a good Thanksgiving.

556	Mike, We are going to be in Dallas for the Big XII Championship game on Saturday night.
556	I just wanted to see if you guys were going to be in town.
556	If so, we would like to come by and see you guys.
556	Especially the newest edition.
556	Let me know.
556	DG
557	Good.
557	The game is in Irving, so I will try to find a hotel around there.
557	It is also at 7:00pm.
557	We will get into town early so we can come by and see you guys.
557	You moved to a new house, right?
557	I'll keep you posted.
557	DG
558	I bought the tickets the week of the Texas-OU game.
558	Up until Sat night, I was planning on selling them to a guy I work with who went to OU.
558	I never thought about a hotel because I really never thought UT would be in the game.
558	I really don't want to put you guys out, especially with a new baby.
558	We are bringing Christopher (he is really excited about going) and a high school aged neighbor (his girlfriend's brother is on the team).
558	If you truly don't mind, then I will talk to Kristi about it.
558	We'll see.
558	How's the new house?
558	Is Flower Mound a little west of Lewisville?
558	I'm not good on Dallas geography.
558	DG
559	I just talked to Kristi.
559	She said no way we are staying with you because of the baby.
559	She is pissed I thought abour taking you up on your offer.
559	I am in trouble.
559	DG

561	thanks DG
562	As I stated on the phone, the deal is valid and Enron will honor its terms .
562	I will get a confirmation sent to you.
562	Thanks DG
563	These are the three that came to mind.
563	I had trouble with my email from home.
563	Let me know what else I need to do.
563	Thanks DG I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.
563	It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.
563	I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.
563	I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.
563	In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.
563	It was a $24MM/Year deal.
563	I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.
563	I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.
563	I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.
563	I also created invoice models.
563	I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.
563	We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.
563	I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.
563	I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.
563	This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.
563	I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.
563	Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.
563	Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.
563	On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.
563	I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.
563	After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.
563	This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.
564	Where are you now?
564	Good luck.
564	DG 281-304-8303 Home 832-524-6091 Cell
565	Congratulations!
565	Enron will most likely file Ch 11.
565	Either today or tomorrow.
565	It's pretty crazy.
565	I really don't know what the future holds.
565	I will just have to wait and see.
565	We definitely want to go skiing.
565	Most likely in the spring.
565	I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.
565	I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.
565	They sure kicked the shit out of the Huskers.
565	I'll keep in touch.
565	DG
566	you got one?
566	DG
567	Absoulutely.
567	When the Texas Monthly article came out, ENE was around $30.
567	We have been told basically nothing.
567	Which is not unlike what has been going on during the entire collapse........At least they are consistent.
567	But we did have attorneys describing what Ch 11 would be like, so I suspect it is only a matter of time until the filling.
567	We shall see.
567	DG
568	We are going to Dallas.
568	I bought the tickets the week of the OU game.
568	Thought I would be selling them until last Sat evening.
568	I think a 5% chance at Pasadena.
568	I think it comes down to Miami-VT.
568	Florida should cruise at home against Tenn and anyone in the SEC west on the carpet in Atlanta.
568	But stranger things have happened........
568	DG
569	Just in case I'm not here much longer, this is my home info: Thanks, DG
570	In case you need the details.
570	These numbers are as of 11/28 curves.
570	DG
571	832-524-6091 Cell 281-304-8303 Home
572	No, I don't.
572	Thanks for the note.
572	DG
573	Alive and kicking............barely.
573	DG
574	Did they accidentally deposit my cut of the $55million in your account?
574	Just put a check in the mail for me.
574	Thanks.
574	DG
575	If it wasn't already obvious to me before all this (and it was), it was a mistake to leave your group.
575	I know you didn't have to step up for me and can't thank you enough for doing it.
575	DG
576	I believe I already have it.
576	I'll look.
577	Yes
578	they need to cheat better
579	Jay, I hope you had a good Holiday Season.
579	Hopefully 2002 will be better than 2001!
579	I believe that this year the limit has been raised on the Education IRA's.
579	Is this true?
579	If so, I would like to contribute more than the $500 that it has been.
579	Please let me know.
579	Thanks.
579	DG
580	Either week is good for me, but lunch is better.....I finished shredding weeks ago.
580	DG
581	Attached is a file that has all of the Central Region EOL products.
581	EOL needs to reassign trader names and books to these products.
581	I realize that not all products will initially be active, but we are in the process of getting everything ready for the restart of trading business.
581	Just put a trader name in column H for the corresponding EOL product.
581	If you have any questions, let me know.
581	Thanks.
581	DG
582	The one I just sent had some East products.
582	DG
583	I'll be there.
583	DG
584	I'll be there.
584	DG
585	Haven't moved my phone yet.
585	Until then, tell the person who answers my # to messenger me to call you back.
586	It looks like the Lagrasta deals are valued at -$7.6 million on ENE's books.
586	I attached the file.
586	I'm still working on the weather deal.
586	DG
587	The HB was pretty wild.
587	We went to the Big XII CG.
587	Good game, bummer outcome.
587	I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.
587	Can I transfer either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??
587	I just tried to call, but no one answered.
587	With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.
587	If you call, ask the person to messenger me.
587	DG
588	I just wanted to drop you a note and ask what's going on and what you plan on doing.
588	I hope all is well and that you had a good Holiday under the circumstances.
588	Take care.
588	DG
589	I'm still here.
589	I saw where they got the QB from Madison as well.
589	Maybe we can get together for lunch early next week.
589	Let me know.
589	DG
590	Here is a link to the schedule.
591	Yes.
591	I talked to Carlos yesterday so I'm pretty sure he is too.
591	I'm just waiting on the fallout from the UBS purchase of my organization.
591	It is supposed to be in front of the bankruptcy court today.
591	I'll let you know.
591	Carley has learned to ride her bike.
591	She is pretty excited about it.
591	We will come see you this weekend.
591	DG
592	Done DG
593	It's pretty sappy.......but I think you will enjoy it.
593	DG
594	thanks DG
595	Could you send me a tracking number for the speakers.
595	I still haven't received them.
595	Thanks.
595	DG
596	I'm in. I'll be shredding 'till 11am so I should have plenty of time to make it.
596	DG
597	This is it.
597	It should be self explanatory.
597	There are values for Jan02 and Feb02 in the file.
597	The value increased a little more than I expected.
597	I didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in December.
597	I will in the morning.
597	I also still need to find the true value on the weather deal.
597	DG
598	This is it.
598	I am leaving the office for the rest of the morning.
598	I will return after lunch.
598	DG
599	His list does not include any of the transport positions.
599	It also includes some deals with the Chicago office that should not be included in the deal value.
599	DG
600	Please take notice of the red cells.
600	These Tagg numbers were incorrect and I have changed the cells to the correct Tagg deal number.
600	All of the deals on this list have been moved to the bankrupcy book.
600	DG
601	Sorry.
601	I've got a UBS meeting all day.
601	Catch you later.
601	I was looking forward to the conversation.
601	DG
602	Here is the file.
602	It contains only financial trades in the active NG-PRICE book.
602	Also these are only Price, Basis, Index, and Gas Daily values.
602	They don't contain any Options.
602	I will get another book set up so we can move only positive net value deals with counterparties.
602	Let me know if you have any questions.
602	DG
603	The file was too big to email.
603	It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.
603	It does not contain any option deals.
603	I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.
603	Let me know if you have any questions.
603	It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.
603	DG
604	Susan, I need to set up some books for the Estate.
604	Ed McMichael wants to separate some of the existing deals into two books.
604	Please let me know if there is anything else you need to complete this.
604	I need these as soon as possible.
604	Thanks for your help.
604	DG
605	I just got an out of the office resopnse from Susan.
605	Will you please begin the process?
605	Please let me know if there is anything you need from me.
605	Thanks DG
606	Nevermind.
606	We are just going to use an existing book.
606	Thanks.
606	DG
607	Attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from NG-PRICE into ENA-WT-SOCAL.
607	Please move only financial deals only.
607	Please let me know when this is complete.
607	Thanks.
607	DG
608	Cecilia, In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.
608	I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?
608	If you have any questions, please let me know.
608	Thanks.
608	DG
609	Done DG
610	These have been moved to the Bankruptcy book.
610	DG
611	Send me a final list of who will be trading on your desk.
611	Thanks.
611	DG
612	thanks DG
613	I put Storey for all of Ruscitti's products.
613	DG
614	This is done.
614	DG
615	Elena, Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.
615	We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.
615	We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.
615	There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.
615	DG
616	better watch out for hunters DG
617	Well, have you been taken care of????????
617	DG
618	I just got the latest and greatest: Storey Lewis Williams Assuming this is accurate, I would like to get from you, as soon as the decisions have been made, what products/regions each trader will be assigned to.
618	This is not only for EOL setup, but also for curve files and P&L/Position reporting.
618	There will be two people, not including myself to run the Central books, so I also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book.
618	Thanks.
618	DG
619	No Gulf Coast?
619	DG
620	Kristi and I planned on going also.
620	Is that OK?
620	We got a dog this weekend.
620	A mutt at traders village.
620	The kids named him Titan.
620	They are pretty excited.
620	How was you're weekend?
621	The GD Options (both calls and puts) are booked year round.
621	They are all in N17872.9, N17872.A, N17872.B, N18064.6, and N18254.4.
621	I will begin looking at the unwind problem.
621	DG
622	As long as accounting doesn't have a problem with it, I don't see why not.
622	The P&L will probably need to be redone for the 31st (Jan) and 1st (Feb).
622	It just depends on what deals change.
622	If it is only annuities, then only last day will need to be recalced.
622	DG
623	This is the last file I sent Dierdre.
623	It has four tabs.
623	One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).
623	The monthly values are PV'd.
623	The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.
623	The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).
623	The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.
623	Transport is just that.
623	I hope this helps.
623	DG
624	Everything is lumped together, meaning price, basis, and index, in that file.
624	DG
625	I wanted to communicate further about a refinancing loan I submitted.
625	Thanks.
626	Transaction ID 610 Product ID 35729 did not book correctly.
626	It is a two leg deal.
626	The first leg is a GD index deal and the price component has the wrong book.
626	It has AB-PWR-ST-GD and should be FB-CENT2.
626	The second leg is a F4F deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component.
626	Previous nights price settle should be in price and $.02 should be in basis.
626	The deal has $.02 in price and $.00 in basis.
626	DG

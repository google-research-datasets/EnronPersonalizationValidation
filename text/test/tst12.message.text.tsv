0	Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent assignment of PGT capacity.

0	ENA and Calpine will formalise % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or annuity amount.
0	As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points.
0	( to be confirmed ).
0	ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine which allows you to request that the period 2 volume be no less than the period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1.
0	ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed).

1	For your information.
1	please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to Calpine for their consideration.
1	Action: Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.
1	At this time, Peter and I are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will discuss on Monday.
1	Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again.
1	The real producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our numbers may be too low to Calpine..
1	even with the counter offer, the front end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal.
1	Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves for a package out to the producers for early next week.
1	Stephanie..
1	one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals...
1	overview...
1	do we have anything available.

30	BT
31	Guys, has there been any arrangements made for a send off for Phil....
31	We need to get him a card and a wedding gift ( I assume you would agree).

31	Pls advise.
31	BT
32	Yes,

33	BT

34	The four of us should still meet asap and agree on paper with PG&E and present this to them.
34	BT
35	Jessica, are we scheduled to have our video conference today..Is the room available.
35	BT
36	Todd, I have gone through all of these resumes and will not pursue a next step at this time.

36	Thanks, BT
37	Jessica, pls contact Robert Ayres @ 713-661-4551 and schedule him for a 1 hour meeting here at the office.

37	BT
38	I sent this document back by fax.
38	BT
39	Dave, the fundy's report is saying that both Kaiser plants are closed, the one in Mead and the other is in Tacoma...
39	are they not buying gas from us on a monthly basis and if so, is this for process?
39	BT
40	Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do?
40	I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there..
40	So, can you pls advise.
40	I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a "Stand Still" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for.
40	By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.
40	Current economics....
40	approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.
40	Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02.
40	There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.
40	None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ).
40	Give me a call.
40	BT
41	pls advise group that we will be meeting today and advise the video staff to ensure it is up and running.
41	BT
42	Jaime, further to our conversations earlier.
42	I look forward to our proposed meeting and will coordinate efforts with Stephanie Miller to prepare for ENA's discussion items.
42	I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times )..
42	As such, we should work towards the end of the month as a timeline for us to come down.
42	We can nail down specific dates soonest.
42	BT
43	thanks, BT
44	Didn't you trade uranium at one time.
44	BT
45	yes but can you spell...
46	has there been a big run up in the pricing on this metal.
46	BT
47	I am track you down on more details or your ability to get them...
47	stay tuned.
47	Thanks, and please disregard spell check comments.
47	evn I mak misstackes ounce and a wile!!
48	Jeff, I believe that your total loss payable equates to $55.00.
48	John and I netted out so you can pay me directly.
48	Thanks, BT
49	Mark's address at home is mawhitt@aol.com BT
50	Mara, it appears that the PGE Topack curve is pulling in the wrong file in the swap spread model....
50	pls fix.
51	I hadn't heard about his changes....
51	did he swith co's...
51	I will confirm meeting time.
51	Thanks, BT
52	We should get together and put this package together...let's plan on spending some time today.
53	Yes, once I complete, I will send over.
53	BT
54	I am sure I will be here...
54	Let me take you out for lunch.
54	BT
55	Thanks for looking after this.
55	I am not as interested in who or how we spent the money, but more so on where our estimates were off.
55	The whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan.
55	Give me a call....
55	when you have a moment.
55	BT
56	Steph, what do you think about RFPing the PGT capacity if and when we get a standstill from Suncor...I was thinking we could send to SMUD, Morgan Stanley, Calpine, perhaps avista.
56	It might be a bit radical...
56	but perhaps can drive out the highest value.
56	BT
57	Jessica, as part of the process when updating or adding items to my calendar or stephanies, pls send a note to me advising who it is and what the planned agenda is.
57	thanks, bt
58	Dave, We believe that Avista has been kicking tires on picking up some term PGT, Nova and ANG capacity...
58	We may be selling it.
58	Pls hunt down a contact who handles this and find out if they want to see our piece.
58	We will probably have 10,000 MMBtu/day.
58	starting out of Nov 2002.
58	23 years.
58	at expansion rates.
58	Call stephanie or myself to discuss.
58	BT
59	I was in Denver when the attacks occured and then I drove from Denver to Houston ( 15 hours ) to get home...
59	I was not in the office until thurs afternoon.
59	BT
60	Are you still using the Access Database for PC and if so, do you think this could be applied to Utility Usage , portfolio MTM etc?
60	BT
61	Were you referring to my lunches.....
61	?
61	BT
62	Can I have a look at this resume please.
63	Ray...
63	seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....
63	and of course so much has happened since then.
63	I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking.
63	I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.
63	With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..
63	1.
63	Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral..
63	I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket...
63	we can get you trading access to EOL.
63	Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront.
63	I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required.
63	( let me know ) 2.
63	As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity.
63	I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.
63	I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.
63	Barry Tycholiz
64	I think that this note did you receive you the first time...
64	Sorry, BT
65	I am available from 1:30 - 2:30 Houston time.
65	BT
66	Jessica, pls book a room and send a notice to Jane Tholt, Stephanie Miller, Phillip Allen, Beck Cantrell.
66	Get us a room at 11:30 pls.
66	Further to our conversation yesterday, Phillip has asked that we meet today to update him on the general and specific efforts related to regulatory concerns on El Paso pipeline.
66	Pls be prepared to discuss the major items we had identified last session and what our position and repsonse is planned to be.
66	If there are any questions give me a call.
66	BT
67	Can i have a copy of these forms pls.
67	BT
68	Pls set up a 15- 30 minute meeting with John and Mark Whitt ( Denver ) to discuss Williston Basin ( storage blowdown).
68	Pls advise.
68	Barry Tycholiz
69	If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements.
69	Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review.
69	I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.
69	Call if you want to discuss.
69	BT
70	Dave, I have read the proposal.
70	Pls coordinate a tele conference with yourself, mark and me.
70	sometime this a.m. Call jessica to set up a definative time.
70	BT
71	Hope things go ok for you...
71	make sure you stay in bed....
71	soon enough you can get up and boss people around.
71	Kim and I wish you the best!
71	I am sure tammi will contact me to schedule.
71	BT
72	Good morning....
72	is all of Nevada Powers generation territory served from Southwests full requirements off of El Paso, or do you get some load from them at Kern?
73	Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.
73	There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc...
73	Let's discuss needs...
73	Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc. BT
74	Pls review
75	Mark, we purchased a gift certificate from the group for Polsky's Wedding...
75	if anyone is interested in chipping in from your place, pls send to stephanie..
75	the total gift was $ 200.00.
75	BT
76	San Diego at Dallas......this weekend.( i think)....
76	Road Trip
77	With the crack team of developers that you had.....
77	you should be able to fetch a pretty premium.!!!
77	..
77	didn't she write code while eating her lunch and breast feeding her kids?
78	Kay, sorry I missed your call.
78	Tell Dave I am in on Sunday ( assume it will be around 7:00 or so)....pls advise on particulars.
78	BT
79	Please print out two copies in COLOR.
79	BT
80	Make sure we charge the proper cost of funds ( int. rate ) for basically putting money out the door for the deal.
81	I just received this from PG&E and wanted to make sure others received document also.
81	Pls distribute as required.
81	BT
82	thanks, I will review in detail and get back to you to discuss a plan....
83	Mark, Dave, I talked to Lavorato regarding a non-compete...
83	he was fine with proceeding to negotiate a commercial deal but did not want us to commit to a non compete ( just yet) for these reasons.
83	1.
83	He wants to not restrict EES in their abilities to market in that region ( I will discuss with Delainey).
83	2.
83	Unless we have an exclusive he thinks we are boxing ourselves.
83	Pls digest these points as you proceed and keep me posted on where Cascade is even with the paper we showed to them.
83	BT
84	As we had talked about yesterday....
84	any deals cut by El Paso are going to be opposed by the shippers ( when it comes to adding new capacity or expanding ) until the existing issues are resolved.).
84	BT
85	FYI Mark, I talked to Fred..
85	this meetingis cancelled until further notice...
85	and for sure you and your people were going to be invited.
85	BT
86	Paul, let's try to find some time on Friday to discuss next steps.
86	BT
87	When you talk to Robert Neustaedter, ask him about the Montebello storage field in Socal's territory that was blown down this year.
87	I would like to know what application they filed, when it started and a summary of the details regarding this deal.
87	There was about 14 Bcf blown down.
87	BT
88	Can you see if you can float out these tickets for tonights game...
88	I cannot make it.
88	I have all 4.
88	BT
89	Leslie, further to our conversation.
89	I don't think the prize in $$$'s is going to give us the leverage we had hoped but I will know better early next week exactly what that looks like.
89	At the very least, we are going to position ourselves with El Paso such that we can have a commercial discussion.
89	BT
90	In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk.
90	I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.
90	Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.
90	If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise.
90	thanks, BT Enron El Paso Scope Barry Tycholiz Gerry Strange / Al Clark Commercial activities regarding EL Paso Pipeline, current issues - negotiations.
91	Todd, further to your voice message.
91	Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday.
91	He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week.
91	As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.
91	At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact.
91	Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.
91	BT
92	Looks like I lost another game...
92	In total I lost $85.00 on sunday.
92	Isn't this fun !!!
92	PS...
92	nice race car in the lobby....
92	can we take it for a spin?
93	Pls print out copies for my files.
93	Thanks,
94	Mark, I was looking at that pricing sheet and would like to suggest that the shading in the commentary boxes...
94	under the assumption that this becomes a printed document and that it is printed in black & white, it is very difficult to read.
94	Perhaps a more solid background would work better.
94	BT
95	Steph, further to our discussion, Pls review.
95	I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.
95	You might want to use an analyst to figure this out.
95	Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this.
95	Pls review and let's discuss asap.
95	BT
96	I talked to Robert Ayers, he is going to accept a job with another co.
96	BT
97	I am available..
97	pls put on my calender to block off.
98	Barry, trust all is well.
98	I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.
98	1.
98	The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002.
98	appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party.
98	2.
98	It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.
98	ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006.
98	( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of " Payment " from ENA to SMUD.
98	Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006.
98	Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest.
98	Thanks in advance, Barry Tycholiz
99	Peter, Eric....
99	I talked to Bradford this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E.
99	He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E.
99	He was going to discuss internally and advise.
99	I am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines Eric and I discussed this a.m. BT
100	Pablo, I did infact lose my "d" drive on my Dell computer so it does not recognize the set up.
100	Should i go re-install my hard drives..
100	and if so, how do i do that.
100	BT
101	Good news on the CMS Deal...
101	How much will this be?
101	BT
102	Mara, pls ensure that everyone takes the time TODAY to fill this out with all the customers that we can market this to, including names and action plan.
102	I will need to review with Phillip and John later today.
102	BT
103	Mike, for your info...
103	we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.
103	As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like...
103	For sure, there are alot of hurdles...
103	It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..
103	1 month, 2 month etc..
103	but we will keep you posted as we move forward.
103	BT
104	FYI, Miquel has decided to not pursue anything with in my group..
104	He did say that he was still considering yours..
104	Good luck...
104	I did tell him that we were hopefull that he would stay within ENA wholesale...
104	BT
105	Amy, pls send the daily pricing sheet to the west gas trading - traders every morning.
105	I think jessica can get you their names and e-mail addresses.
105	BT
106	Benny, I don't know if you knew Brad or not...
106	but he used to work at Coral in Calgary.
106	I think he traded Merc.
106	Anyways, he has contacted me a couple of times to play hockey and really wants some players..
106	I told him I would forward this note.
106	I am going to try to get out one of these days.
106	TIC
107	Ty- can you send to me a copy of the latest producer package that we had sent out.

108	Good job...
108	let's keep it going.
108	BT
109	Louise, further to our meeting last week, the contracts have been executed and the Rockies transportation has been sold to CMS.
109	Origination and trading participated in the P&L.
109	Orig = $ 1,045,000.
109	Trading approx $310,000.
109	We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.
109	Please call if there are any questions.
109	BT
110	Good morning...
110	There is NO issue on your e-mail that is going to get in the way of Family issues...
110	so don't worry about that.
110	Don't knee cap the band because you guys owe me $ 4,000.00.
110	I was just checking on what your decision was...
110	keep me posted.
110	BT
111	Sonya, further to our conversation the other day...
111	I am still not able to read the first couple of letters on the left hand side of the page under Headlines...
111	Have you had a chance to look at this.
111	BT
112	Never did...
112	but glad we were here to ensure it was captured.
112	BT
113	Can i have copies of this.
114	I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount...
114	10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high.
114	BT
115	sure
116	Eric, I have at least 2 tickets and possibly 4 tickets for tonights game....
116	I believe it starts at 7:00 PM.
116	I did ask eric boyt...
116	have not heard back.
116	Can you see if you or any of your people would like to use them.
116	Let me know..
116	I want to make sure they get used.
116	BT
117	we are working on it...
117	but I have been distracted and slowing the process down.
117	BT
118	Good morning...
118	Tim Belden ( Trading) and Chris Calger ( Origination) are in charge of all power issues in the West U.S. I would also think Paul Kaufman may already have a hand in these issues ( if PUC related ).
118	BT
119	Sorry I couldn't pick you up on the call...
119	I would love to play.
119	BT
120	Interesting....
120	and probably true...
120	I was watching the news last night and it is unbelievable how much scrutiny all of these assets are going to get in the next little while, the reality is that everything could be a terrorist target...
120	Nukes, water, tall buildings, stadiums,electrical generation assets, fuel depo's, crop dusters...
120	Pls keep us posted..
120	the implication here is that expansion projects like TransWestern could receive pressure on their ability to expand as the generation equation gets stirred up.
121	Sonya, can you please contact Frank Vickers ( VP East Orig).
121	He was looking at my screen and was interested in getting it.
121	Also, can you provide for him a report on what systems his group currently has and whether or not there is an opportunity to reduce some of his costs by using the system that you set me up with.
121	No need to reply, pls contact Frank.
121	BT
122	ozzie....
122	???
122	he doesn't golf...

129	BT
130	Jacy called me the other day and said you guys met...
130	He is a really good guy..
130	they have three young kids...
130	For right now, the best thing that we can do is try to find a nasdaq related fund and possibly by half of that and the balance in some sort of term bond fund.
130	I have not set you the documents back as of yet.
130	BT
131	Eva, I was talking to Jean the other day and she has advised me that you will be working in the Producer One group.
131	I would like to talk to you about some of the things you worked on this year as they relate to storage development etc...
131	Can you contact me early next week to get together for 1/2 hour.
131	Thanks in advance.
131	BT
132	I thought you guys might like this one.....
132	I am trying hard to defend ourselves...
132	but they might be right..
132	BT
133	These are pretty good.
134	FYI, I have invited a couple of my marketers and their customers to go to this on Sunday..
134	ENA ( my RC ) will not be charged back.
134	Who is paying the bills....
134	and how much are they?
134	You would have to believe it is a lot.
135	I did not know she had resigned.
135	BT
136	Mark, do you have any customers that we could invite as a guest to this event.
136	I would be more than happy to host.
136	I have tickets for the Sunday race....
136	Oct.7.
136	Let's discuss on Monday.
136	BT
137	Paul, can you please advise as to who you are directing these packages to and the status of their interest.
137	BT
138	Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday...
138	here is the latest.
138	You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price...
138	is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.
138	Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas.
138	I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.
138	He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04.
138	( that's with no orig to Canada).
138	That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together.
138	Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).
138	At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey....
138	then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.
138	Call if you guys want to discuss.
138	regard, BT
139	Marc, you had left a message on my voice mail last week from one of your customers at sclumberger...
139	I am forwarding his name and number to Frank Vickers group to follow up as this customer requirement is not part of my service territory.
139	Thanks, BT
140	Any news this fine monday morning...
140	BT
141	Louise, please review and if you require more verbage I can add a lot more than this...
141	I believe this captures the basic scope but if you think otherwise, let me know.
141	BT
142	thanks.
142	BT
143	For the most part the term of the back to back was 23 years.....with step up volumes.

148	pls advise.
148	BT

156	Kim, Russel Diamond is going to provide to you a complete overview of deals, power and gas, and MTM positions, plus contractual status.
156	You should get a copy of the master documents.

156	BT
157	Mark, I have not read these documents but Gerald and I did discuss scope...
157	let's start to go through this with actual details.
157	BT
158	Yes that does sound a lot like your structure....I fill address from here...
158	BT
159	call me when you get in please.
159	I have a couple of questions on this.
159	BT
160	Louise, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer ( George Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest....
160	the reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and EES would help them create or structure ..
160	This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help.
160	Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts....
160	Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.
160	I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.
160	Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.
160	regards, BT
161	Here is the schedule...
161	next game Oct 20.
161	against Nevada.
161	Not the most exiting schedule.
161	BT
162	Patrick, sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in L.A. this week.
162	As mentioned, I am responsible for the Gas Marketing efforts in the West.
162	For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing.
162	My groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc...
162	.items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.
162	We spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc. You had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.
162	Please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim....
162	if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.
162	Thanks in advance.
162	Barry Tycholiz Vice President Enron North America
163	I am a believer....
164	marge, I went in and registered but my name is coming up as a director...
164	should be a V.P....
164	I don't really care but if you are updating files pleas have this changed.
164	Barry Tycholiz
165	I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage...
165	I will advise.
165	I think fuller was doing some leg work also.
165	Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?
165	Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen?
165	BT
166	I should no longer be on this circulation.
166	Can you please have me removed.
166	BT
167	Mark, I have approved this expense report..
167	With regards to the Wyoming Gas Fair.
167	What is the total cost of that trip for you,looks like $ 3,000 or so including airfare, hotel and ancillaries, also ( I believe Paul was there ).
167	What are his expenses going to be for this?
167	Thanks.
167	BT
168	That may be a better date for me anyways...
168	pls put me down.
168	BT
169	Kim, I will attend.
169	Jessica, pls add to my calender.
169	BT
170	Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver.
170	I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.
170	For sure we want to know what they are up to.
170	I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty.
170	( is it edison), or DWR?
170	It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan.
170	Do you know the CFO ?
170	regards, BT
171	John, If possible I would like to talk to you regarding two deals this morning.
171	1.
171	JM Huber - hedging deal / prudency issues required to protect some risks in 2002.
171	2.
171	El Paso Transport assignment discussions and plan.
171	I can be there any time....
171	need 10 minutes.
171	BT
172	As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day.
172	The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing...
172	Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)...
172	and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded...
172	they hold 35,000/day in 2003.
172	Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion.
172	Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together.
172	As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.
172	As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on...
172	pls do same.
172	BT
173	Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of.
173	The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed.
173	In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.
173	Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk...
173	plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals.
173	In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks.
173	I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.
173	I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..
173	Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.
173	BT
174	pls copy
175	Eric, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium.
175	In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement.
175	I.E.
175	if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.
175	BT
176	Yes, I had also heard that Calpine/NPG have passed on the early start date...I think PGT will show this to the market....
176	no change regarding the 02 issues as of yet.
176	BT
177	BT
178	Latest doc's.
178	pls review and comment on wording applicable to regulatory indicator that triggers events.
178	BT
179	Ty and Phil, can you please advise as to the status and provide me copies of all documents related to payment # 1 and # 2 regarding the kern shippers.
179	What I really want to do is tie out paper work, signatures and ensure that we are tight on all fronts.
179	Pls advise ( by co. name ) the status of all pending documents and a plan to get signatures as required.
179	BT
180	Thanks, I have taken a quick look at this and will think about other applications.
180	I will follow up soon.
180	BT
181	absolutely.
182	Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.
182	I would like to discuss the details of a bill.
182	What is this base fee, are there other plans available?
182	Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan).
182	How many minutes are we getting what are the long distance and roaming rates?
182	In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high.
182	Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.
182	Thanks, BT
183	Pls coordinate a vacation schedule planner for me for all of the staff from now until the end of the year ( including Jan ).
183	Pls include Denver BT.
184	Can I get all this printed out please.
184	BT
185	I just sat down this a.m. and have been either in a meeting or working on a deal.
185	I should be able to get back to you in the next hour or so.
185	BT
186	Ted, it's that time of year...
186	I would like to meet with a few good a/a's to try and place in my group for year end.
186	Any comments on the process or path I should take on getting this done.
186	BT
187	you know, can't trust those lawyers.....
187	BT
188	Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices and load.
188	As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.
188	The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.
188	Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.
188	Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.
188	With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you.
188	One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.
188	Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.
188	I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.
188	regards, Barry Tycholiz
189	Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday...
189	here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.
189	In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is....
189	otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.
189	Pls review and advise if you need anything further.
189	BT
190	please keep me posted on progress....
190	and if there is any way that I can help...
190	photo sessions and baby kissing are my Forte !!!!
191	Please include in this annoucement that the West continues to be managed by me and Mike Grigsby.

195	Give me a call at your convenience to discuss any matters you were wanting to talk about.
195	thanks, BT
196	Jeff, I did leave you a message on Friday that I was unable to meet with DWR on monday...
196	You and I need to hook up on Monday to discuss plan of attack regarding gas and as per your original message I agree with you, it starts with some basic discussions around their intent, vs trying to bang out a Master agreement that may go no where.
196	Talk to you today I hope.
196	BT
197	Let's try to get out soon.
197	Also, I ran into Mike Roberts ( the weather guy) and he would like to join us some lunch hour...

204	If not, pls call me when you have a moment.
204	Thanks, BT
205	I was going to add a footnote to this note but thought I didn't need to as I know for a fact ( by individual ) that we do not have any issues in West Gas Orig.
205	This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that Mike holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.
205	Your work hours are not in question...
205	nor are those of Denver, and Houston based origination.
205	However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity.

209	or is Balwin's co.
209	going to carry the ball.
209	I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..
209	Further to our conversation of last week...
209	let's meet with these guys soonest.
209	BT
210	you are up early....
210	This Friday, Monday a.m. or Tues will be fine.
210	Mark is in San Fransisco...
210	who were we going to see in Sacremento.
210	BT [Tycholiz, Barry]
211	Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like.
211	The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation...
211	other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.
211	Pls coordinate and let me know.
211	BT
212	There is a cool screeen saver here that I want to save.
212	BT
213	That was pretty funny....
213	he is doing research on NW utilities, however that is not their mandate to market to them...
213	so I say, then why are you doing research...
213	he say's ...
213	" I'm not... who said I was"...
213	it was about that time I started to laugh...
213	oh well.
214	Can you find the gas daily article from Yesterday ( related to DWR purchse practices ) and e-mail or fax to jeff please.
214	Thanks, BT
215	Don't forget to drop the software box back to me..
215	I need to install my printer.
215	Also, the roadrunner e-mail address seems to have disappeared off of my mainframe..
215	do you now why and do I have to re-install or talk to roadrunner.
215	Thanks, BT
216	Louise, I presume that this note was for Thurs A.M.
216	Is it still scheduled.
216	BT
217	I need to get paid out for this years efforts first...
217	if that isn't forthcoming..
217	then I can start tommorrow.
217	otherwise Q1/02.
217	BT
218	Ozzie and I are going to the Front porch after work...
218	5:00 PM..
218	I thought I would invite you, I know we could all use a couple.
218	I will buy.
218	BT
219	Jeff, Just looking at teeing my a schedule..
219	any feedback from either/ both.
219	BT
220	Make sure Fuller pays up.....
220	I know he has some money hidden somewhere....
220	thanks.
220	BT
221	I have put down 2:00 - 2:30 on Nov. 6/01.
221	Pls come by 3206b.
221	If this is not a good fit, just let me know and we can re-schedule.
221	BT
222	I am not waiting for the stock...
222	just cash now.
222	Don't know if I will get enough of that either.
222	I don't mind working for a few more years..
222	just don't want it to be 20 more.
222	I don't think I will be in Denver that early....
222	What's going on?
222	Calgary, Who knows?????
222	Stock meltdown is a long story...
222	perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment..
222	we are in preservation mode right now....
222	but I believe things will be fine.
222	All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.
222	Better run, let's talk soon.
222	BT
223	Is there an action item with regards to the preparation of agreements?
223	If so, I would like Dave Fuller in Portland to work on the creation of the appropriate gas contracts and the discussions with Puget.
223	Please advise.
223	BT
224	Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.
224	I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.?
224	Are the QF's generating power today?
224	BT
225	Lorelie, I had sent to you last week a amending doc regarding a one month extension that the customer was looking for in order to exercise the option on some of that small volume.
225	They have contacted us and I beleive they will be exercising and would like to get the paperwork back in order to get this process moving.
225	Can you please have document signed and returned to me soonest.
225	Thanks, BT
226	Hi there...
226	can you do me a favor and get me the Home, Cell and work numbers of the following people in Canada.

226	BT
227	pls load into my cell phone.
228	thanks mike.
228	BT
229	what about a contract position....
229	3 months or something.
229	I was talking to Steve South..
229	I know steve would like to pick his brain for a while.
229	BT
230	Oz,....
230	i am going to pull the shoot early today (3:00) ....
230	sorry about that...
230	as such, drinks is going to have to wait.
230	BT
231	Guys....
231	as discussed, I am going to be tight on time tommorrow as such, I am going to take my own car up...
231	and would suggest you two carpool together....
231	I am leaving houston at 8:00 AM and need to be back by 3:30...
231	thanks.
231	BT
232	Mark, I have reviewed this file and believe it is accurate up to the end of Q3..
232	Can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance..
232	I am not worried about 10 or 20,000 either way because I don't think we will manage down to that level anyways.
232	BT
233	Thank you for meeting with us this week.
233	Speaking on behalf of Enron U.S. I know there was some very good clarification, information and hopefully action required by all the parties.
233	I look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss.
233	I have also met with our legal team to discuss the commercial and legal issues related to the GISB ( under 30 day firm agreement ) and need to discuss the details with you to see if we can get the proper paper completed.
233	I have also raised a draft Master Firm agreement ( to handle term structures) and will begin to review this for early next week also.
233	Thanks in advance, Barry Tycholiz Vice President Enron North America
234	Same....
235	I think I had the wrong address for you Veronica...
235	trust this finds you this time.
235	BT
236	Mark, I was talking to Jay on Friday and he was telling about Kerr McGee shutting down their operations.
236	Is there any play here for you guys.?
236	BT
237	Let's try to get together today.
237	BT
238	Morris...
238	if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front...
238	for example $ 10MM $'s....
238	would that be considered taxable income?
238	We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.
238	BT
239	Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us.
239	I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.
239	I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.
239	Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.
239	Pls keep me posted.
239	BT
240	I am out of town tues, weds..
240	pls schedule for some time on thurs.
240	BT
241	Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.
241	SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues.
241	Don't know if there is a deal here or not?
241	Thanks, BT
242	Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento...
242	I can make that.
242	Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city.
242	Any word from SOCALED.
242	Give me a call this a.m. and we can figure out travel plans.
242	BT
243	Mark, let's discuss letter to BP prior to it going out this a.m. BT
244	Faizal,....
244	did you ever get a refresh of numbers from us for gas supply on the new IPP you were working on?
244	If you have time, give me a call and you can update me on things you are looking for.
244	regards, BT
245	Can you get me a map / printout to get to this location and also to SMUD 6301 S Stree, Sacremento.
245	BT
246	Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight.
246	I have a car and will talk to you enroute to Sacremento.
246	I am staying and meeting with SMUD at 11:30 - 1:00 and then probably meeting with PG&E on tues at 3:30.
246	I will either leave for Houston tues night or weds a.m. pending any possible meeting with SocalEd in L.A. If we cannot meet with them this week, then I may reconsider that trip for next week.
246	Thanks, BT
247	Jaime, thanks for setting up last weeks meetings...
247	I thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties.
247	We will follow up directly with Pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals.
247	Did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters?
247	Is there any specific action required by west gas at this time, if so, pls contact me to coordinate?
247	regards, BT
248	We need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations Pemex believes they will have in the next 1 - 5,10 years.
248	The more obligation they have at the border, the better off we are..
248	What they used to deliver upstream of the border, we can replace for them synthetically.
248	Pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days.
248	BT
249	Jessica, pls schedule Chris for Thurs.
249	BT
250	Can i have copies of all of these resumes pls.sort analysts, assoc...
250	etc. BT
251	I don't believe that the agreement you had sent to me for Cochrane is the latest version.
251	I thought we executed a new agreement with tiered volumes...
251	can you have someone re-check this and get back to me.
251	BT
252	Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.
252	Do you have any recon....
252	on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on.
252	As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.' There is a zero sum game on fuel...
252	but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it!
252	Any thoughts.
252	BT
253	Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in. I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers...
253	and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs..
253	and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink...
253	it is long overdue..
253	Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour..
253	then out for a drink...
253	what about next tues....
253	Pls advise.
253	BT
254	Meeting with PG&E went OK...
254	they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.
254	PROGRESS I guess....
254	Flights were good..
254	got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day...
254	IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on..
254	.that would be great.
254	BT
255	Steph, why did you have two tickets for L.A....
255	and why will one be used for Future travel?
255	BT
256	I don't know about a speech...
256	but a few words of encouragement and a kick in the ass is inorder.
256	BT
257	Pls make sure that you guys are attending the fundy's meeting....
257	mara and yourself .
257	Thanks.
257	BT
258	I thought we were going to show them a number to work with....
258	What is this conversation about option values on the pipe?
258	BT
259	received your phone message, call me on thurs.
259	BT
260	that was today...
260	I had heard they were sniffing around about optionality values?
260	It is not in the agreement.
260	just a question.
261	Heh....
261	What's going on..
261	I was talking to Kevin the other day and he asked how you were and I soon realized that I never called you back to take you up on the beer.
261	Are you around this weekend..
261	I have tickets for the Golf tournament...
261	for Friday and Sunday, was thinking of going.
261	Any interest..
261	I will probably go sunday a.m. Drop me a line...
261	PS...
261	work is OK, I think we will be fine..every day is a new day but overall, my guys tell me we will be alright.
261	BT
262	Ina, please make the tour arrangements for our group for Tues Nov, 6 at 3:30.
262	West Gas trading and West Gas orig.
262	( I can get you the names if you need them).
262	Let me know if this is booked and I will put on my calender.
262	Other than Mike, the group does not know we are planning for this tour.
262	Thanks.
262	BT
263	Jay, what is status on credit worksheet for MGI.
263	Pls advise.
263	BT
264	My location number is 3206b.
264	pls forward packet.
264	Thanks.
264	BT
265	Pls do not restrict my ability to kill my career....
265	the problem with me sending this note internally is that they would probably want to hire the writer of this note to help restructure some of our outstanding agreements.
266	for your review.
266	BT
267	Today is my 6 year anniversary...
267	I have yet to get a 5 year belt buckle and inlight of the fact it may be the only thing I get out of this co...
267	would like to know what my choices are....
267	pls advise.
267	BT
268	here it is...
268	BT
269	In a couple of years, I may not be employed...
269	but I am sorry to hear that you cannot make it..
269	I am probably going to slip out on friday and catch 9 holes and then probably on sunday..
269	I a go, i will let you know so you can watch for me on TV.
269	See ya.
269	BT
270	Mark, thanks for seeing us this week.
270	I am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe I am making progress.
270	I shall get back to you soonest.
270	Can you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR.
270	For example, if I were to sell you gas via Enron Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery?
270	Is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).
270	Thanks in advance, Barry Tycholiz
271	As always, would love to...
271	How are the Kids?
271	If you have any new pictures, pls e-mail.
271	Our home address is ktycholiz@houston.rr.com.
271	Talk to you soon.
271	TIC
272	WOW....
272	I am positive that your beautiful wife did not sign up for hauling three rug rats( plus 1 dad ) around the back streets of London....
272	what have you done????
272	I would love to talk market conditions with you but I think we are banned from doing any work for the next three months while this co.
272	continues to fucks with my money....
272	HACKS !!!
272	Although not bitter, for years I have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done..
272	and that my time was coming...( just around the corner)....
272	!!
272	little did I know that when I made that turn, some guy named Jerome.( take a minute to imagine) ...was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure I knew I wasn't quite there yet.
272	HACKS !!!
273	Info...
274	Amy, can you add the cash and rest of month price for Henry Hub onto your daily pricing sheet.
274	I think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures.
274	Thanks, BT
275	Good morning Chris.
275	Further to our conversation of yesterday.
275	I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group.
275	We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team.
275	You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies.
275	You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip.
275	Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.
275	Please use this note as a formal offer of employment.
275	I would like you to start as soon as you can..
275	( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday.
275	Pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters.
275	regards, Barry Tycholiz
276	Yes...
277	Let's discuss on Monday..
277	I am open to either plan.
277	BT
278	Mara, pls ensure that your file includes pipelines that flow east of the rockies, like trailblazer, Northern, NBPL, ( check with the Denver guys to get all the pipes.) BT
279	Thanks for the reply..
279	Let's talk asap regarding this transportation.
279	I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place.
279	You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south.
279	We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).
279	25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!
279	I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).
279	Thanks in advance, Barry Tycholiz
280	jessica, can you check on getting us set up for every second monday.
280	Also, please look into pre-booking conference room space.
280	BT
281	Done....
281	for dinner, let's have perogie...
281	what do you think?
282	Has anybody from Calgers group met with him recently,( I know Mike was involved).
282	BT
283	Benny, Lavo gave me that voucher to use at the TPC..
283	..
283	are you able to get away thurs afternoon, or friday or on saturday some time.
283	Let's try to get this used up.
283	In terms of a 4 some, check to see if Fletch wants to play.
283	I will re-check with Lavo to see if he is available.
283	BT
284	Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).
284	I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week.
284	Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.
284	It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow...
284	and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go.
284	This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.
284	Looking forward to those discussions.
284	BT
285	I think we had discussed this but as a result of security issues accessing the building we will defer until next week our plans.
285	Thanks, BT
286	pls defer meeting plans until further notice.
286	thanks, BT
287	I would be happy to take a run at this, see where the customer is at, and then set up a joint session for you and me.
287	I will update you asap.
287	BT
288	web site.
289	Jessica, I have a 2:00 meeting with the weather desk can you verify that I have a room booked ( my room is fine), just make sure Grigsby is not using it either.
289	BT
290	Just checking in....
290	We keep waiting for that 3:00 am call to watch Micheal....
290	Is she getting close?
290	....
290	I heard Kim and her had their nails and toes done yesterday...
290	nice....
290	I may want to sign up for that.
290	( not the nails part...... just the schedule).
290	TIC
291	Bill,as requested, I talked to Michael Tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 1 year would be ok with PG&E Company .
291	I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending)....
291	I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.
291	Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day.
291	( estimated ) and I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery.
291	Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears.
291	All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.
291	The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.
291	Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products.
291	I do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays.
291	Please advise if any questions otherwise I am seeking the GREEN Light from you to take the next step.
291	regards, BT
292	yes, I would like to interview some of the candidates....
292	please schedule within reason, and as required.
292	BT
293	Lavo told me that if any of these guys hear about this...
293	he will kill me?
293	Pls do not distribute and handle with care with Steve.
293	BT
294	I am fine with them starting at 2:00 pm.
294	Is that consistent with other groups..?
294	BT
295	We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be....
295	LC's, cash are difficult.
295	Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas...
295	and very little mark to market valuations.
295	Thanks, BT
296	Screen Saver, There are some good beach screen savers here...
296	will try to put one on our PC.
296	BT
297	This is pretty funny.
297	BT
298	Bart, Let's re-schedule meeting for some time next week.
298	I have not spent the time deserved for this survey and will do so once corporate issues are resolved.
298	BT
299	Entering into term agreements with Enron today is probably not the best play until our credit / restructuring issues are resolved.
299	What are you thinking about?
299	All is fine, hanging in there, pissed off like you would not believe...
299	but not much I can do now but wait it out..
299	I have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting.
299	BT
300	Can you look into this...
300	what is it about?
301	Good morning....
301	Callaway Park buys Disney World ( Milly told me that one).....
301	The Management is trying hard to put on a good face forward, but they fucked this one up nicely.
301	My plans are simple..
301	hang out to see if I get paid...
301	after that, not sure.
301	I am thinking about taking golf lessons...
301	that how bad things have gotten.
301	Yikes..
301	PS, send us a new e-mail of the kids...
301	Thanks for the note, TIC.
302	They are laughing at us now...
302	TIC
303	For your e-mail.
304	This is funny
305	Unclear...
305	Dave and Lavo have been pretty quiet...
305	but I am with you ...
305	if whalley is in, I have to believe those guys are also....
305	Chapter 2, coming up.....
306	Let's not get it installed until we move.
306	Thanks.
306	BT
307	thats fine.
307	next week is early enough.
308	I was in an electronics store the other night...
308	Panasonic has 9" Portable DVD player ( like your sony) with an 8 hour battery... $999.00 US. It is sweeeeeeet. TIC
309	I think we should still do this, and I may join you guys.
309	BT Dates please.
310	Tom, no problem....
310	Can you reply to this note....
310	or advise how to incorporate the rotating symbol into a file.
310	Thanks, BT
311	what date is this planned for.
311	BT
312	Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.
312	The request is for approx $ 11MM.
312	They are referencing a provision in their tariff that says that if a co.
312	goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.
312	I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out.
312	I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).
312	A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m. regards, BT
313	Carl, just wanted you to know that I have decided to NOT offer William a rotation in west gas and I have talked to him this a.m. As discussed, I like his basic skill sets but I decided this a.m. to hold off for the next 2 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year.
313	I am sure he will find a good rotation, just wasn't the best fit for me at this time.
313	Thanks, BT
314	Ty, pls check your model, I would believe you have a file reference error on the July 25, 55 day payables number ( when you include new deals).
314	Pls update and re-issue to me first thing.
314	BT
315	Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures)..
315	Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable.
315	Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get.
315	Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further.
315	Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.
315	Thanks, BT
316	Mike, this was that item I wanted to talk to you about...
316	I assume Kim got to you first.
316	I appreciate your response...
316	It is extremely important that we maintain the highest quality of service to the wholesale customers where we have MSA's or full requirements arrangements and obligations.
316	Thanks, BT
317	Dave, although we need to track deal count, I continue to get orig amounts granted to you for $ 40.00...
317	that is to small a number to worry about...
317	I would think $ 500.00 / transaction would be a better cut line...
317	Remember, we are after deal flow, and orig....
317	no need to reply..
317	BT
318	Jeanie, as I read this e-mail i cringe at the thought that we have been dancing around this issue for 4 months yet all around us we will be laying off some very good employees who really deserve to be here, and more importantly, want to be here.
318	Plenty of time has been given to this issue.....
318	please fix as soon as possible.
318	Do you need anything from me?
319	Mark, for right now, I would not suggest we pursue any external hires.
319	We are going to see a lot of internal staff from different business groups looking for work.
319	BT
320	Kim, please schedule the appropriate people for a 15 minute discussion.
320	I am sure that this can be resolved.
320	Also, be prepared to discuss the "Penalties" component of our obligations to put this in perspective.
320	BT
321	Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights..
321	specifically who owns what rights and until which period.
321	It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG.
321	We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific..
321	We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.
321	Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap...
321	thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation).
321	Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT.....
321	stat !!!
321	Pls advise.
322	I want this program continued for my group at this time.
322	BT
323	No problem...
323	by the way, I heard you guess were able to get the VNG deal completed...
323	that is great news.
323	Congratulations.
323	BT
324	Chris, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?
324	It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term.
324	( winter Gas).
324	You would think that they would be fine with loading up on Enron.
324	Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!!
324	With regards to a meeting....
324	I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would be ideal.
324	I will call you today.
324	BT
325	kevin, do you have the phone number for Geysa Arujo at the Williams Shrink - Cochrane facility.
325	She called me the other day and I must have taken her number down incorrectly.
325	Thanks.
325	BT
326	We just moved over to our new building yesterday and i was moving my rolodex and your card popped up...
326	Everything good by you?
326	BT
327	Thanks for the note back....
327	yeah, I am still kicking....
327	and I am sure you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake this guy...
327	when I grab on , I grab on tight....
327	Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our documents..
327	I think we have all had to dust off the paper...
327	but I sincerely hope most of it is behind us.
327	I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work...
327	I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be back up...
327	and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis....
327	all in all Houston is treating us pretty good.
327	Work really has been great and I have such a good marketing region...
327	california, arizona, Denver....
327	vegas...
327	are some of the highlights...
327	so when I need to, I go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..
327	Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year)....
327	she may have to pick up the pace on that effort...
327	( she is fighting me on that one)...
327	House is good, weather right now is great...
327	80 degrees ( all the time)...
327	there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals...
327	Better run, take care, talk soonest.
327	BT
328	Paul, thanks for the note...
328	do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of MTM or payables/receivables?
328	Like everyone else, the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but I wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them.
328	BT
329	Not really...someone from Williams called you regarding a document that needs to be signed by the 30th..
329	is that a C/A for NWPipe....
329	She was covering for Jan, I did not get a chance to take the call, just heard about it...
329	BT
330	thanks, enjoy the few days off...BT
331	Dave, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.
331	Louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere!
331	Pls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with Karen Buckley ( et al ).
331	Let's re-visit program in mid-december.
331	regards, Barry Tycholiz
332	Bill, as part of our conference call this a.m....
332	please have Debbie identify the top 20 companies that we have out of the money positions to and that we would want to assign in the money deals to.
332	Included in this list we must know the contractual terms of these counter parties including, company name, collateral threshold limits, collateral posted, type of contract ( gas or power ...etc.) Physical or financial.
332	Master Netting...
332	In addition to this, we must determine if we can cross pollinate agreements...
332	I.E...
332	a gas agreement is used to offset a power position or vice versa.
332	Lot's of questions but to start, let's get your list of " Co's who are seeking collateral from us today" and fill in some of these blanks.
332	Thanks, BT
333	Not sure about the fax but will get back to you.

342	Jay, do we have copy's of all the executed documents...

342	Also, did we change the counterparty names in the system and put in offsetting transactions with SOCAL etc....
342	and new positions with PG&E.

342	MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS.

348	The particulars of the structure are.
348	Delivery Point: El Paso Keystone Pool Pricing Reference Point: Gas Dailiy Daily Index Electronic Index Midpoint or the Gas Daily Daily Index Midpoint.

349	BT
350	Great Pictures of the kids....
351	Leon, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect.
351	This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to.
351	However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.
351	As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines.
351	Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.
351	Thanks.

352	I tried to call you last night around 6:00.
352	I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.
352	Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans..
352	I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never...
352	SO, I told him to review the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk..
352	it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.
352	Call me this a.m. BT
353	Jim, stephanie will be in this morning, cannot do lunch, and we will be back to you by 12:00 our time to confirm the 4:00 pm conference call.
353	Thanks, BT
354	stephanie, I know that Ed McMicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our transportation positions ( if any remain ) and also our obligaitons.
354	I will confirm his name and from here on in, you may be asked only to assist, not lead these discussions.
354	However, for the purposes of PGT ( at this time ), I would ask that you continue on your path of resolution.
354	I will follow up with Canada this a.m. to ascertain what they have done with the NOVA and ANG portions.
354	BT
355	I am still here and probably will be here until atleast the end of Feb. I have had to lay off about 5 of 12 people which includes outright termination ot allocation to the estate( clean up, bucket brigade ).
355	I have been designated to go to the NEWCO which is the trading and marketing core asset business that will be sold lock stock and barrel to a Wall Street firm.
355	It is looking ok at this time and we will find out in the next couple of weeks what happens.
355	We are still planning to be home for christmas and plan on seeing you guys...
355	somehow.
355	Talk to you soon.
355	BT
356	Lorelie, I know we did not get to finish our conversation.
356	call me on Friday ( if you so desire or have time) .
356	In thinking through this issue, I am not really sure that it matters how these deals are now being confirmed, nominated or paid.
356	settled or netted against.
356	I am not even sure that we can do anything to change them once we filed.
356	There is a good chance I am not thinking about it properly and will be happy to discuss on friday.
356	Thanks, BT
357	I assume this is for my info only, or do I need to do something with it.
357	BT
358	Ed, if you have time now call me to discuss.
358	713 302 6442.
358	Thks BT.
359	Mark, further to our conversation of last night.
359	IT is important to the PROCESS that you guys complete the forms submited to you by Kelly Little...
359	and this document gets incorporated into a master file ( being used by the exec committee.).
359	Can you please ensure that this document is completed asap.
359	As always, Thanks.
359	BT
360	High .....merry christmas.

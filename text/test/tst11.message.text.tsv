3	AS we discussed.
4	Bob, I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.
4	It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.
4	However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.
4	I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.
4	I hope that you will take a look at it.
4	Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.
4	Also, I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.

16	I am also talking to the desk.

17	The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.
17	Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.
17	They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.
17	Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.
17	It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.
17	This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.
17	Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.
17	Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.
17	The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!
18	when is the meeting and where?
18	thanks, Kim
19	Chris, The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am.

134	Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.
134	Thanks, Kim
135	John, Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.
135	I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.
135	Then you can decide how you would like to persue.

139	Janette, Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in order to do business.
139	Enron's credit department is asking for the guaranty to be for $10 million.
139	Let me know if you guys are agreeable to this.
139	Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP BILLITON LTD.
139	We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.
139	Let me know if you need updated pricing.
139	Prices were down on the day but have moved back up.
139	Thanks, Kim
140	Janette, I did leave you a voice message.
140	The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.
140	Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.
140	In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.
140	Let me know if you have any questions.

143	When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.
143	Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.
143	Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City.
143	Lonely, huh?
143	When does Lawrence move in?
144	Janette, We are offered at $2.69 for San Juan gas for August.
144	The adders for scheduling are the same.

144	' Thanks, Kim
145	what kind of breakdown?
145	when did I ever have a breakdown?
145	A mini mid-life crisis maybe (hence the belly ring).
145	Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.
145	Theresa just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.
145	I had to break the bad news!
145	When Lisa and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!

147	I really didn't think I would ever see them again!
147	I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.
147	I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.
147	Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.
147	I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.
147	I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!
147	So if you're not serious - don't tease me!
147	Take care and thanks again for the CDs - Love, K2
148	Night Shift was on Showtime Saturday afternoon - thought of you and your stellar performance of one particular scene.
149	Please call me.
150	Linda, Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?
150	I have to admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me!
150	Anyway, I was never able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the invitation to join.
150	Do you still have the email or invitation that would allow me to join?
150	I can't wait to see the pictures out there!
150	I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
150	I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.
150	Wish you could join us!
150	I hope all is well with you - take care!

153	H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.
153	H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.
153	I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.
153	Still trying to figure out this weekend.
153	I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.
153	One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.
153	I will keep you posted.
154	Ok - we will meet at 3:30 and call hesco at 4.
155	Try kim.ward@ect.enron.com.
155	If that doesn't go through, just try kim.ward@enron.com.
155	Thanks for sending it to me!
155	Take care - Kim
156	Jane, The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.
156	One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.
156	There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc. Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.
156	EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.
156	Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.
156	thanks, Kim
157	SMUD is buying, we are selling.
157	It is a fixed price call - not gas daily.
158	Here is the lastest spreadsheet of deals I have done with Citizens.
158	Please call if you have questions.
158	Thanks, Kim
159	BHP is still in the market for Balance august San Juan.
159	Can we do this or can you call that guy that spiro recommended ASAP?
159	Please let me know.
159	thanks, Kim
160	I didn't get it.
160	It may be because you sent it to Kim.Ward@ect.enron.com.
160	Sometimes that works and sometimes not.
160	If you get a chance to try kim.ward@enron.com it would be great.
160	Sorry for the trouble!
160	Thanks for helping me out!
160	Kim 2
161	What do you want to do with bhp for august?
162	It's official - I am coming in on Saturday, Sept. 8.
162	Missing the matchbox 20 concert here in houston!
163	Chris, Besides making this consistant and pretty, how does this spreadsheet look to you?
163	Am I leaving anything out?
163	According to the desk, they didn't take much during July.
163	Thanks, Kim
164	I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.
164	Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!
164	Don't know when I will get there yet.
164	Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?
164	I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.
164	Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?
164	or just my drinking goggles?

169	I am sorry to say that I missed it!
169	How are you and where are you?
169	I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.
169	Hope you are enjoying yourself.
169	I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.
169	It was a lot of fun!

176	how was your weekend?
176	Did you go to greenwood?
177	Ann, Can you check on the palo alto confirms for deals that were done around the 20th of July?
177	I think there are about three confirms they have not received and Karla at Palo Alto is going to get in trouble internally.
177	thanks, Kim Ward
178	This was hilarious!
178	I can't believe that you remember I have a cat!
178	How are things?
179	Chris, Call me if you have any questions.
179	These prices are pretty much where our offers are.

179	thanks, Kim
180	Anne, I just got another phone call from Palo Alto.
180	They still have not received three of their confirms from deals done around the 20th of July.

180	thanks, Kim
181	Any word on BHP copper?
181	We have a couple of days to determine whether we can transact with them or not.
181	Right now, they are only looking at Bal Aug, Sep, and Oct San Juan.
181	Let me know Thanks, Kim
182	What's up with this?
182	they are looking to lock in 12-16 months of gas prices.
182	We have been selling to them month to month for 6 months.
182	Have there been any problems?
182	Are we going to let them go to Amoco?
183	I just talked to Jay and he doesn't want to do a long term deal with them.
183	I have a call in to the consultant.
183	Max Jay might agree to is 3 months.
184	try dennis.holcomb@smud.org OR dholcom@smud.org .
184	told him he should get it tomarrow.
184	Thanks, Kim
185	I don't know - maybe we should talk to Ann Bike.
185	I guess it should go in as an annuity.
185	Would you like for me to talk to Ann?
186	I would love to - I really like going to the movies but never seem to make it!
186	Only one stipulation though - we don't go see planet of the apes!
186	I heard it was REALLY bad - possibly the worst movie ever made.
187	Janette, Could you do me a huge favor and have Vito give Jay Williams of our credit department a call.
187	Jay is having trouble getting through the pohone lines to you guys for some reason.
187	Jay has tried to track down some financial information internally and has had no luck and doesn't know where else to look.
187	His number is 713-345-3923.
187	I really do appreicate you passing this message along.
187	Thanks, Kim
188	Ann will be calling you today and will set this deal up for you.

189	Darla, will you send me and Ann Bike the June spreadsheet that you are working off of?
189	Thanks, Kim
190	Thanks, but I meant the one related to the Griffith deal.
190	Do you have one?
191	We missed you for sure!
191	It was a fun time.
191	I was glad to see everyone.
191	Nothing exciting took place - just a little dancing and visiting.
191	All went home at midnight.
191	Boy have we become boring in our old age!
191	Take care and keep in touch!

195	Thanks, Kim
196	Ann & Darla, I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.

265	Hi guys, Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.
265	I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.
265	One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.
265	I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.
265	Let me know if you have any questions.
265	Thanks, Kim
266	Let me know when you find out.
266	Have a good day!
267	j., attached are contracts that I was discussing with you this morning.

267	Thanks, Kim
268	Stacy, I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.
268	I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.
268	they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.
268	I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.
268	They want to transact by mid next week.
268	Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?
268	Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.
268	Thanks, Kim

270	PG&E City Gate is the delivery point and lets start out with $.05.
271	Jason, I need your help on 2 EASY things - 1) I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.
271	United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.
271	What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?
271	And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.
271	2) THIS IS REAL DEAL: Merced Irrigation District.
271	They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.
271	I gave them an indication of $3.85.
271	I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.
271	Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?
271	They were concerned about what credit would require.
271	Please let me know as soon as possible!
271	I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!
271	Thanks, Kim
272	Sure!!
272	Jeff at Merced said to tell you not to stay late!!
272	Thanks, Kim

280	Steve, It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.
280	If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.
280	We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.

280	Just let me know when you are available.
280	Thanks, Kim
281	Mike, I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.
281	It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.
281	However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.
281	Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.
281	Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.
281	Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.
281	(I will be out Monday) Have a great weekend!
281	I hope this is helpful.
281	Kim

295	Hey Lyndon!
295	Very glad to finally hear from you.
295	Sounds like you are happy back in Austrailia!
295	I would love to see it sometime.
295	Unless things change between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on January 6th.
295	We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Martin look fabulous.
295	We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before we get on the boat.
295	I hope you are there.
295	Although I would understand if you stayed where you are!
295	Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay in Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.
295	As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really close to me was killed.
295	I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just in time not to get stuck there.
295	One of my very good friends was suppose to be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was called back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.
295	Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 am tuesday morning.
295	That meeting saved his life.
295	I am so glad that he had that meeting.
295	I would have been devasted if something had happened to him.
295	However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.
295	He is very sad but greatful to be alive.
295	It does make you think about what you are doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.
295	It is sad that this thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.
295	Most things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freedom were taken for granted.
295	I also can't believe that someone could come in and do so much harm to innocent people.
295	And I don't know what should be done to stop such things from happening in the future.
295	Can I just run away to the beach and ignore it?
295	It's a good thing that not everyone has that aAnyway, I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.
295	I am doing the same - just here in ugly Houston for now!
295	I think that my trip to Aruba for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of the year!
295	Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go back to the Poly.
295	Oh, and thanks for the picture!
295	Take care, Love, K2 ps.
295	I have another email address at home.
295	It is kward1@houston.rr.com
296	This looks ok to me.
296	Thanks, Kim

301	they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.
301	I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.
301	I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.
301	It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.
301	CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??
301	PLEASE?
301	I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!) Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!
301	thanks, Kim

309	We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.
309	Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda?
309	Let me know if you have any quesitons.
309	Thanks, Kim
310	what do you guys think about this one?
310	Jay, we have talked about them before I think.
310	Can I get a response in order to put this away or pursue?
310	thanks, Kim
311	1) hesco additional collateral 2)Noresco - they want to focus on 10 or 20 years - can we get there?
312	I don't have their financials but lets get started on what we can get started with.
312	I am not expecting to do financial swaps in the immediate term but I would like to be preparted when we are ready.
312	Thanks, Kim
313	Steve, Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.
313	The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.
313	I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.
313	Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.
313	I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.
313	In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.
313	One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.
313	Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.
313	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
314	Just talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared.
314	They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.
314	All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.
314	We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.
314	If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.
314	Jay, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.
314	And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.
314	It's all about you!!
314	Thanks a million for your help!
314	Kim
315	lose this email address!
315	your site has been blocked by my company and I can not remove as described below.
316	no.
316	I will try to investigate today.
317	They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.
317	They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.
317	Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?
317	Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.
317	what do you think?
317	I will keep you posted on discussions.
317	Thanks!
317	Kim
318	Antoher thing they brought up was locking in physical basis only.
318	How does this affect credit?
318	Thanks again, Kim
319	VERY Cool!
319	I will keep you posted on the structure that we are focusing on.
319	Right now it is Nymex + physcial basis.
319	They will lock in basis but not Nymex.
319	We can talk about the potential risks there if you want.
319	Kim
320	Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.
320	Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.
320	And this will help your credit cause.
320	So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.
320	Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?
320	I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.
320	Call me if you need anything.
320	Thanks, Kim
321	hey Amy, Could you add Art Avalos ( aavalos@pnm.com ) to your price sheet email list?
321	Let me know if you have a problem!
321	Thanks, Kim
322	Steve, Attached are form certificates that you can use for the first two documents required to be included with your executed ISDA.
322	I hope these are helpful - please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.
322	Thanks, Kim
323	Mike, We still haven't heard from Dave - he may be wondering who Jason Williams from Enron is.
323	If you guys could work him from you end, it could speed things up.
323	Thanks for your help, Kim
324	You're welcome - It should be fun!
324	Kim
325	we are VERY close!
325	when were you here?
325	and why are you slummin on the gas floor so much?
326	you goin?
327	ok, I was wondering if you came to work today.
327	I certainly didn't want to!
327	still sorry to hear about your deal.
327	I hope things get better!
328	here are our curves for san juan for the last couple of months.
328	You make the chart - I was not successful.
328	Also, I have attached a storage chart.
328	let me know what else you need.
329	my friend Shannon is coming over at about 6:30 and we are going out - somewhere.
329	what are you doing?
330	Do you think it would be beneficial for me to go to WSPP?
331	oops - it's ksward63
332	Chris, Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.
332	As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans.
332	the main issue is as follows: 1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.
332	This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).
332	The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.
332	I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.
332	I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.
332	I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.
332	thanks, Kim
333	went this morning - did you go?
334	Any word on Noresco?
334	Just got a call -
335	Darla, Attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details August business with Citizens regarding the Griffith deal.
335	Please use this to prepare your invoice.
335	Also, please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date.
335	John Cogan should not be paid until we get paid by Citizens.
335	Please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the TW invoice as well as Sitara.
335	In addition to billing Citizens, the following entries need to be made each month: 1) payment to John Cogan 2) origination to Kim Ward and Chris Foster (50/50) 3) payment to EARMS for the $.02 insurance Chris negotiated These amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet.
335	There may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon.
335	Call me when you get a chance.
335	Thanks, Kim
336	Jim, Could you send an electronic version of the latest RFP you sent out?
336	I am having some people help me internally and an electronic version would be helpful.
336	Let me know if you have any questions.
336	Thanks, Kim Ward West Gas Origination
337	Jay, A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.
337	Could you let me know where we stand with that?
337	I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.
337	thanks, Kim PS Also, I know you sent Debra a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.
337	Did you?
338	Hi guys, Could we provide a price indication to PNM for a physical call option (offer) for Cal 02 and Q3, 2002 for San Juan gas?
338	Let start with $.50 out of the money and $1.00 out of the money.
338	This would be a monthly option.
338	Please let me know if you have any questions.
338	Thanks, Kim
339	Art, We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions - 1) Is this physical or financial 2) Is is a daily call or monthly call 3) Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?
339	I other words, what do you want your cap to be?
339	Thanks, Kim ps What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?
339	I'm trying to work around some meetings etc.
340	Can you price that physical call for PNM at the money and $.50 out of the money instead of what I previously requested?
340	Thanks, Kim
341	Art, The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.
341	For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.
341	I hope this is helpful.
341	Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.
341	I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.
341	Thanks, Kim
342	Hello again, I talked to Mary Jo yesterday and exchanged emails with Tricia - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.
342	If Tricia didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I. How does that look for you?
342	I can get a ticket right now for $188.
342	I do wish you would come down here with Jeff sometime.
342	Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!
342	Jeff could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!
342	Yes - I am still hanging out with Pete.
342	Things are good.
342	He is very nice and lots of fun!
342	Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!
342	Love, Kim
343	Saw you at the baseball game last night.
343	Credit being all work and no play is just not true!
344	What do you know about Panda Resources?
344	Nothing in a rush right now but I am showing them 10 year prices for their plant in AZ.
344	I would, however, like to be prepared to do bidness!
344	Let me know what you need.
344	Thanks,
345	Don, Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.
345	Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.
345	Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?
345	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager West Gas Origination
346	Art, It looks like I won't be able to make it.
346	I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.
346	I really appreciate the invite though.
346	Maybe next time.
346	However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.
346	I will let you know what my plans are.
346	Thanks again for the invitation.
346	Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
346	Kim
347	Hi David, I got your name from Don Black as the replacement for Roger Ponce.
347	I am on the West Gas Origination desk for ENA in Houston and often run across customers looking for gas supply, particularly in California, that would be considered retail customers.
347	I am forwarding a request I received this morning that EES might be interested in. I will continue to forward such information to you unless you let me know you are not the person I should be contacting.
347	Thanks, Kim Ward
348	Craig, If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it.
348	Thanks, Kim
349	Debra, A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.
349	I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.
349	I haven't received a copy of this draft.
349	Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience?
349	Thanks, Kim Ward
350	Kelli, When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?
350	Still an indication.
350	They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.
350	They are leaning towards this blend though.
350	thanks for your help, Kim
351	thanks!
351	Kim
352	Steve, Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.
352	Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.
352	Also, did you receive my indications for the products you were interested in?
352	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
353	Some of these are pretty funny.
354	From Fuller -
355	Jeff, Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.
355	For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.
355	Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.
355	Let me know if there is anything else you need - Thanks, Kim
356	Let me know if you need anything else - Kim
357	Let me know if you need anything else -
358	Monica, Let's talk once you get a chance to review.
358	Thanks, Kim
359	variable is all we reimburse them for - they are responsible for the demand.
359	Let me know if you need anything else with regards to the redwood capacity Thanks, Kim
360	Kelli, Could you (or someone) price up an @ the money call option for 1500/day (physical) at Malin for July - October, 2004?
360	Please let me know if you have any questions!
360	thanks, Kim
361	monthly would be correct!
361	Thanks!
362	Sara, Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.
362	Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.
362	1) I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.
362	This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.
362	Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.
362	He feels this reference should be deleted.
362	What is your opinion regarding this?
362	2) We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.
362	One form ws a form resolution.
362	They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.
362	Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.
362	Will this suffice?
362	When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.
362	I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.
362	I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.
362	Thanks for your help, Kim
363	Glendale's City Attorney is Steve Lins.
363	His phone number is 818-548-2080 and his email is slins@ci.glendale.ca.us.
363	Please let me know if you need anything else.
363	I will be in their offices on Wednesday.
363	Thanks, Kim
364	Is this to obtain outside opinion?
364	I thought we were going to do that at our own expense.
365	I will work on this for you - and will be in touch.
365	Thanks!
366	Steve, could you provide the name, phone number, etc. of your bond council for our attorney, Sara Shackleton?
366	Thanks, Kim
367	Sara, FYI, how do we proceed?
367	Kim
368	Barry, I haven't had a chance to review this but I will when I get in. Thanks, Kim
369	call me
370	I am back in the office - we are having a conference call this afternoon to iron out the last calculation questions and you will get a final spreadsheet for August and September from Mara Bronstein.
370	I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.
370	Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?
370	What do you guys need in order to pay them?
370	Thanks, Kim
371	Sounds good to me!
371	Just let me know what time.
371	You gonna work out?
372	I will be happy to cruise the mall with you - as long as we don't go on halloween!
372	Have a great afternoon and I will see you later!
373	Kelli, While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.
373	Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.
373	Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.
373	They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.
373	I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.
373	I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.
373	thanks, Kim
374	Hey, just workin and playin.
374	No planned vacations!
374	What's new with you?
374	How's work?
374	Things here have slowed down somewhat.
374	Hope that's not a bad sign for next year!
374	What have you been up to?
374	Haven't seen you about town at all.
375	socal border.
375	Thanks for your help Kim
376	Hey!
376	Glad to hear you are well.
376	I have thought about our days on the 92nd floor as well.
376	Had some acquaintances that worked for Cantor as well as a close friend who worked for them that was called back to Houston for a meeting that very morning.
376	Very glad he is with us today!
376	It is cool that you hired Palmore.
376	You will have to tell him hello for me.
376	I did come back to Houston in January.
376	Enron brought me back to peddle gas in the West US.
376	Nothing much new in my life, just a new house and job - but I am glad to be back.
376	I miss the outdoor life in Portland but the people here are so much more fun and nice!
376	If you are ever in town - you better have a beer with me!
376	I will let you know if I am in Dallas - Take care, Kim
377	I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.
377	Awesome location.
377	You will have to see it sometime.
377	I think I invited you to my housewarming party.
377	I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.
377	I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.
377	Maybe the following Thursday?
377	I am usually open - let me know.
377	Kim
378	Jeff, A 10 year fixed price indication at the PG&E City Gate out of Jan. 02 is approximately $3.32.
378	I hope this is helpful.
378	Let me know how I can help facilitate the blend with Merced.
378	Let me know if there is any thing else that you need.
378	thanks, Kim
379	David, Here is another possible retail deal in Cali.
379	Good Luck!
379	Kim
380	Sent to David Hensel, Director of West Marketing for EES.
380	He will probobly delegate it.
380	Let me know if you need anything else.
380	Thanks, Kim
381	Sara, Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.
381	Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?
381	He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.
381	Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.
381	If I should send it on to some one else.
381	Please let me know that as well.
381	Thanks, Kim
382	Jay, Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?
382	Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.
382	Let me know if you guys need anything else.
382	What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?
382	Thanks, Kim
383	I am attaching proforma statements for the 2 Panda projects in Arizona.
383	Hopefully we can put together a credit worksheet and send them a contract.
383	(At least that's where I think we are!) Any news on SRP or NCPA?
383	Thanks, Kim
384	J., Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.
384	The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is Dean Park, 916-781-4224.
384	He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.
384	You can reference the RFP if you would like.
384	You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.
384	The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda.
384	The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.
384	We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.
384	This would be a sort of blend and extend.
384	Our deal would be Physical Basis.
384	Let me know if you have any more questions.
384	Thanks, Kim
385	Thanks, Beth.
385	Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any questions.
385	I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts.
385	If you guys need anything while we are waiting on those, please let me know!
385	Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.
385	Thanks, Kim
386	David, I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit Stone Container Corporations plants in southern California.
386	Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.
386	The contact at Summit is Jason Ramsey and his number is 502-429-3800.
386	Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.
386	Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?
386	Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let Jason know.
386	Thanks, Kim Ward
387	Mara, Here is the proposed revised contract with Citizens.
387	Could you take a look at it and see if the logic works in accordance with the spreadsheet?
387	sort of like how you built the original spreadsheet from the original contract.
387	Let me know if you have any questions and how this turns out.
387	Thanks, Kim
388	Kelli, Attached is a request from PNM for an indication for the price of a put for Q3 next year.
388	This is a physical option that is at the money.
388	Please let me know if you have any questions.
388	Thanks, Kim
389	Art, We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.
389	For the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.
389	For the Daily put, the premium would be $.535.
389	Let me know if you have any questions.
389	Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.
389	If you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better as well.
389	Thanks, Kim
390	Susan, Sorry this has taken so long but attached is my first cut at a term sheet for Exide Technologies.
390	Please call me with any questions or comments.
390	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
391	Susan, Call me if you need anything.
391	Thanks, Kim
392	I will be traveling to Arizona for meetings next Tuesday and will be meeting with Salt River Project.
392	I would like to be able to take our ISDA comments with me.
392	Where do we stand with this?
392	thanks, Kim
393	Hey Lyndon, How are you?
393	Long time - no email!
393	I hope things are going well for you.
393	Went to Happy Hour with Kim 1, Susie, Stacy, and Melissa last night.
393	Susie and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.
393	Kim 1 and Melissa left today for Cabo San Lucas.
393	As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.
393	Not nearly as much fun.
393	But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!
393	In other words - I am poor!
393	Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.
393	I think we all hope we see you in Jan!
393	Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!
393	Love, K2
394	Darla is ready to bill citizens for Sept. I guess we can use Cogans sheet if we are comfortable it is correct.
394	Let me know if you need anything and when you think we can get this to Darla.

396	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination

410	Please call me when you get a chance.
410	I have a question.
410	thanks, Kimmie x30685
411	Funny you should ask about my life right now.
411	Now you are sure to get an earful!
411	Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick, I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.
411	( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one) I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.
411	But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.
411	I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.
411	AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.
411	However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.
411	Down to whether we get bonuses or not.
411	It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.
411	Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.
411	Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.
411	I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.
411	As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.
411	Who knows!
411	Keep in touch -
412	Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.
412	Funny how things can change in just one week!
412	Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I would do without her.
412	We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.
412	Not a late night.
412	You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.
412	Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.
412	(See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!) Take care and keep in touch.
413	He is canadian.
413	Did you meet him?
413	What's going on this week?
414	Chris, Can you send or fax me a copy of the contract between us/Citizens and EARMS?
414	I don't have a copy and i need one in order to get these invoices processed.
414	thanks, Kim
415	PLEASE take me with you.
415	I am at a low in my life - recently reassured that I am a failure in relationships that really mean something to me.
415	The only point in my life where I can't seem to be successful.
416	Please remind me of the exact changes so I can go to my back office.
416	Things have just been crazy around here so sorry for overlooking this.
416	' Thanks, Kim
417	Art, We are pricing the calls up for you and will have them in the morning.

420	Art, An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.

438	I will have Patti review it once they are done.

454	Glad to hear you had a good weekend.
454	I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!
454	Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?

477	Hey Lyndon, It was nice to hear from you.
477	We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!
477	Things here have been changing by the day.
477	To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock, therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.
477	Things just aren't right.
477	But hopefully, things will start to get better.
477	I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!
477	How was your gay cruise?
477	I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!
477	I do hope all is well with you.
477	We will all be ready to play and relax in January!
477	Take care - Kim
478	Gerald, Thanks for looking at this for us.
478	When do you think you will have a chance to review it?
478	I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.
478	Also, do we need to have credit re-review?
478	Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.
478	Thanks, Kim
479	How are you doing?
479	Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!
479	How was your wine tour?
479	I thought about you guys.
479	It looked like so much fun!
479	Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!) I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.
479	Let me know what you think!!
479	And I hope all is going well for you!
479	Kim

480	What about Rosie?
480	Let me now the details!
480	Thanks for the invite -
481	I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.
481	I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules!
482	Gerald & Stacy, I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.
482	It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.

482	No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.
482	I am also attaching the RFP itself.
482	Please let me know if you have any questions.

482	Thanks, Kim
483	el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.
483	just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.
483	As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.
483	Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.
483	what are your thoughts?
483	Kim

492	Remember these are in therms so you need to take off one digit.
492	Let me know if you have any questions.
492	We need to get this done so that we can get a price to Portland my this afternoon.
492	thanks, Kim
493	Thanks!
494	Dear Mr. Lopez, Attached is Enron North America's response to your RFP request for Natural Gas Supply to Frito-Lay's plants located in California.
494	I have also attached your completed bid form and our comments to your Attachment 3 to the GISB contract.
494	It is my hope that we are able to be the successful supplier to these plants.
494	Please feel free to call me at any time to discuss our proposal as well as to answer any questions that you might have.
494	Sincerely, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
495	Mara, Could you break the attached volumes down to MMbtu/day for each facility as well as total per day?
495	thanks, Kim
496	I threw most of mine away - now I will munch on chocolate all afternoon.
496	At least it tastes better!
497	I think I might show up - was going to work out here but it will be less crowded there.
497	See you there
498	Thanks for the funny!
498	We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.
498	Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.
498	I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.
498	Talk to you soon - Kim
499	Rob, I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.
499	I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere!
499	I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in. I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!
499	Kim
500	Brent, Attached is my response to your RFP request.
500	Please let me know if you have any questions - Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
501	She was planning to go to Dallas Friday anyway.
501	I will talk to her on Monday and see what the plan is.
502	Phillips?
503	I will check on this - also, keep me posted on Conexant and let me know how you want to set it up.
503	We are busy getting moved onto the new floor.
503	Kim
504	also, who use to do the smurfit invoice and who is their boss - do you know?
505	Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.
505	All these huge changes.
505	Not much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a change for a few months, if at all.
505	Maybe just some new faces - I think that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that part.
505	Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!
505	But very nice.
505	Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!
505	Anyway, as for Suzanne - she was with EES on a product development project.
505	She worked with Corporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay on with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.
505	At least this way, she knows she is employed until then.
505	She wasn't so sure about the EES gig and I think she is right.
505	My parents were going to come here for Thanksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip - so they aren't coming.
505	Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out with myself!!!
505	You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?
505	I hope you have a great thanksgiving!
505	Lets get a beer after - its the holiday season and time for (good) cheer!
505	Kim
506	are you talking about JS?
506	thought she was going to kentucky?
506	I was going with my friend Elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on Friday.
506	So I may just ride back with her.
506	Trying to figure it all out.
507	As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.
507	As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.
507	They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.
507	Do we need to have a meeting?
507	And when can I expect a response from the desk?
507	Thanks, Kim
508	Let's meet today at 3:00 in conference room 6106 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens.
508	If you are unable to make it, please let me know.
508	Thanks, Kim
509	$3.18 plus origination
510	Jim, Just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up.
510	Kim
511	Sean, I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.
511	Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.
511	Thanks, Kim
512	ok - I am here
513	I'm off my call
514	Terri, What's going on and how was your weekend?
514	We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!
514	Are you going to see PH over the holiday?
514	Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
514	Let's get together for a beer soon - Kim
515	I say lets do it!
515	and so does Terri.
515	I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.
515	I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!
515	Keep me posted on how your day is going.
515	I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.
516	Thanks so much for your help!
516	Kim
517	when can we meet today to discuss our written response to Citizens?
518	FYI, We are addressing this today.
518	Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.
518	If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.
518	Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk.
519	Dan, Just wanted to follow up with you to see how things ended up with your RFP.
519	I would really like to be the natural gas supplier to your plants in California.
519	Please call me at your earliest convenience - 713-853-0685.
519	Thanks, Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination
520	Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?
520	I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.
520	We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.
520	I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!
520	Thanks, Kim Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.
520	I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.
521	if you are on continental, are you flying into IAH?
521	Maybe that is what I should do and we could take one cab.
521	what do you think?
522	in the case that you want to call him!
522	Kim
523	absolutely nothing.
523	Just working on whatever I can.
523	very slow.
523	what about you?
523	what are you doing thanksgiving?
524	Palo Alto for December.
524	Let me know if you have any questions.
524	Thanks, Kim
525	please remove me from your distribution list
526	please remove me from your distribution list
527	Stacy, The customer has requested that we send them 2 executable, signed copies of this contract.

527	I will have them sent to the customer.
527	Let me know if you have any questions.
527	Thanks, Kim
528	of course, I'm just tagging with you guys.
528	Did you ever go to Christopher's?

528	And where do you want to leave from?
529	Sean, Attached is our response to your request for a description of the steps Enron is taking to improve flows to the Griffith power plant.
529	Please let me know if you have any questions.
529	Thanks, Kim

530	Thanksgiving was just ok - have had better.
530	how was yours and what did you do this weekend?
531	came back from dallas friday - just went to houstons with a friend.
531	Saturday, worked on the house and ran some errands.
531	Went out saturday night and drank too much - just hung out yesterday.
531	Nothing at all exciting!
531	I am very boring these days!
532	I went to this party with my friend Brad Fagan - we ended up at this loud bar and ran into P. - It wasn't much fun.
533	yes - he's always nice.
534	Here are my updates, Kim

538	thanks for the look
539	Terri, We are definitely watching the ballgame at suzanne's on saturday.
539	I am getting an email list together so if you have some people you want to add, just let me know.
539	How was Tennessee and your Thanksgiving?

543	please remove my email address from your distribution list.
544	Shannon, Would you let me know of any future cuts as soon as they occur so that I can let Sean know what is going on?
544	thanks, Kim
545	Megan, Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?
545	If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?
545	Can we check into that?
545	Let me know - Kim
546	check this out - can you tell I am bored?
547	what's happening?
547	I am bored.

553	Suzanne, can you forward to Lori and Joe Gordon.
553	Terri, Can you forward to Pierce, Stacy, and Donna?
554	yes - he said you can.
554	What's going on tonight.
555	you still here?
556	please remove my email address from your distribution list.
557	Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.
557	However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.
557	Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.
557	What do you think the time frame is on this?
557	And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?
557	Thanks, Kim
558	Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems.
558	All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have.
558	I have no idea what flows.
558	I hope Patti can help you soon.
558	Let me know if you don't hear from her today.
558	Thanks, Kim
559	thats fine - we can't pay them anyway
560	Are you going to hang out with me and Camille tonight?
561	Jack, Thanks so much for the message.
561	You are right, we are still a great trading organization.
561	Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.
561	As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.
561	I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.
561	Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.
561	Thanks again for your email - Kim
562	This makes 8
563	why are they doing this?
564	So do we have a special agreement in place for the full requirements gas deal?
564	I think that you did that deal before I came to the gas desk.
564	How can I get a copy of the penalty language?
564	Thanks, Kim
565	Please remove me from your email distribution list.
566	Mr. Dossett, I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.
566	No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.
566	I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.
566	Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.
566	Sorry you'll miss it!
566	And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.
566	Think I'll win?
566	Kim

582	Please let me know what information you need to make this change.
582	Thanks, Kim Ward
583	Jeanie, I would like to change my United Way contribution to zero and it looks like Kathy is no longer with us.
583	Who should I send my request to at this point?
583	Thanks, Kim
584	did you put that on my desk?
585	Cliff, For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.
585	I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.
585	Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.
585	The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.
585	Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.
585	Please let me know if you have any questions.
585	Thanks, Kim
586	Some of you may have gotten a similar email before but it seems as though it is appropriate once again - I just wanted to pass on my personal information so that any of you can get in touch with me through a mean others than Enron - 3110 Lake Street 713-526-7117 (home) 713-412-4571 (cell) Please keep in touch!
586	Kim

588	Is this a new email address for you?

589	Just got a call about a power originator job in Denver.
589	Interesting!
590	hello
591	Lou, I am still here but I am unable to give out quotes at this time.

599	Megan, Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.
599	However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.
599	I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.
599	Let me know if you have any questions.
599	Thanks, Kim
600	I hope you are doing well.
600	I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.
600	My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.
600	I hope you will be able to make it!
600	My job search is going well.
600	I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.
600	I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".
600	I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!
600	We can chat more when I see you!
600	Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!
600	Talk to you later - Love, Kim
601	check out the following websites for airfare: www.orbitz.com - the best so far.
601	www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.
601	Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.
601	Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter) p.s.
601	If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.
601	Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.
601	You can check Camille out for yourself.
601	Bring others along.
602	Mary, Attached is a letter providing notification of our cancellation as authorized market for the city of Pasadena.
602	Please let me know if you have any quesitons.
602	Thanks, Kim Ward

604	Patti, Just a reminder that we are no longer authorized marketer for Pasadena or Smurfit.
604	HOwever, we are acting as agent for Pasadena and will continue to schedule for them.
604	Please let me know if you have any questions.
604	Thanks, Kim
605	I sent the spreadsheet and instructions to Megan Parker.
605	She should be putting it together for you.
605	Thanks, Kim ps.
605	I will be out until Jan. 14 except for checking in on the 28th and the 2nd.
606	$353 - you have no excuse!
607	We are not authorized marketer - only agent.
607	In other words, we are scheduling for them but not supplying their gas.

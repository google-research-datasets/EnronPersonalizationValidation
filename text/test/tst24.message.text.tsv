0	I would love to visit with you about a rotation.
0	I plan on being on vacation next week, but I will be working between Christmas and New Years.
0	What are your plans?
0	With a PRC tomorrow (Tuesday, December 14) and the crunch of finishing a number of items before I go on vacation, it may be tough to get together this week.
0	So get back to me with your schedule.
0	Thanks.
0	--Sally
1	Please give Gretel a final list of dates that you plan to be out of the office from December 20 through the end of the year.
1	For the dates that you will be out, please provide the name and number of the key contact person in your group that will be in the office on the days that you are out.
1	As I have in past years, I will compile a list of key contacts through the holiday period that we can use internally within Energy Operations.
1	I will also provide this list to others outside Energy Operations who may needa contact list during this time period.
1	Please get this info to Gretel by Wednesday at noon, so that I have time to finalize the contact list before I am out on vacation.
1	FYI: I plan to be out of the office the week of December 20.
1	I will be at home during that week and can be reached there if necessary.
1	I will be back in the office on Monday, December 27 and I will be working through the end of the year.
2	Thanks for the contact names.
2	You are right - no staff meeting on Monday, Deceber 20.
2	Have a merry Christmas!
2	--Sally
3	Please schedule a meeting for me with Jim Cole for the week after Christmas.
3	Thanks.
4	Yes.
4	I would handle this through expense reimbursement.
4	From: Sheila Glover 12/15/99 04:19 PM
5	Thanks for the invitation.
5	Unfortunately, I will be on vacation next week and will not be able to attend.
5	Have fun!
5	--Sally
6	I will attend the Houston Chapter GBN Winter Reception on Thursday, January
7	FYI: Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to the 30th floor.
7	This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.
7	They are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.
7	While room for this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.
7	By being within the same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and this scheduling team.
7	As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team should be included in space requirements.
7	We are working with Liz Taylor on those requirements.
8	Approved.
8	Pls Process.
8	Thanks.
8	Sally Beck
9	We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th floor.
9	Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.
9	In the mean time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the capacity on the floor.
9	While these locations are not prime spots, people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.
9	Once the window seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.
9	I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.
9	Susan Harrison is working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition period.
9	Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 30th floor.
9	If there are any problems once a move has occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext.
9	3-6279 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.
9	If Chantelle is not available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.
9	Maria can be reached at Ext.
9	I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the window spaces.
9	We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and supplies on the floor.
9	Please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by December 31.
9	During this clean-up process, if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext.
9	3-5237 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.
9	Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment.
9	Between now and the summer of 2001 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.
9	I would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively.
9	If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.
10	Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.
10	For a woman who can't remember the last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!
10	Thanks, too, for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two days.
10	I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my upcoming days off.
10	I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.
10	Thanks for your enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless effort.
10	It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be fun.
10	1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - a direct result of your contributions.
10	I look forward to meeting new challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together.
11	This is what we sent to A/P.
11	Let me know if we need to resend.
11	Thx.
11	G.
12	What is the latest on this?
13	I hope that the two of you received a copy of this.
13	Although Jennifer;s message doesn't mention it, I assume also that she reviewed the findings with you.
14	Did you get a copy of this?
14	It looks as if in September that our intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase iOctober with Enron Europe.
14	Do you have details behind this?
14	Are EES balances gas only, or gas and power?
14	How do we have imbalances with ourselves?
14	What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regulbasis that gives you the details behind this?
14	I am assuming that these imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would reallybe closer to the details than would financial ops.
14	Is that a good assumption?
14	--Sally
15	Whom would you recommend play this role for Energy Operations?
15	Let me know your thoughts.
15	--Sally
16	Cindy: My schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on December 17 that I am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off for Unify/SAP integration.
16	I have asked Stephen Schwarz to give me his recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so.
16	I think that is a good idea.
16	As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays, I will be back to you with a name.
17	I am not especially surprised that you and Kristin did not get a copy of this report.
17	My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred.
18	Approved.
18	Pls.
18	process.
18	Thx.
18	Sally Beck
19	FYI -- As a result of a discussion that I had earlier in the week with
20	I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our aquisition of CES's wholesale business.
20	I realize that balancing all of this has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of year actitivies.
20	Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to effectively absorb the CES book of business.
20	It is noticed and appreciated.
20	As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and contributions in 1999.
20	It was a challenging and rewarding year for ENA and Energy Operations.
20	I hope that each one of you enjoys the New Year's celebration.
20	I look forward to all that will be accomplished by working together in 2000.
21	I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the office on January 1, 2000.
21	I appreciate your willingness to devote part of your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.
21	As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.
21	Ken Walther, in working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan for January 1.
21	Your work on the first will be the final step in this process.
21	Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as usual.
21	I wish each one of you a happy new year.
21	I continually feel privileged to work with this dedicated and talented group of employees.
21	I look forward to all that we will accomplish in 2000.
22	We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back.
22	We found a few minor issues, primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect.
22	The content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct.
22	These were really just query and formatting issues.
22	All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.
22	So at this point we feel confident about our system situation.
22	More will unfold with counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we.
22	Hope your new year's celebration was fun.
22	We saw pictures of the London festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at home.
22	See you soon.
23	I am resending the original message that I sent to Kevin regarding Rick Causey's memo.
23	Please refer him to the second point in my e:mail, as well as the attachment.
23	Thanks.
24	Does the info as provided from HR indicate MBA's from UT?
24	I know that Enron probably has a number of undergrads from UT.
24	At this point, I am specifically interested in UT MBA's, as it is the Houston Chapter of UT's Graduate Business Network for which I will now serve on the steering committee.
24	Thanks!
24	--Sally
25	Reference for future months.
26	These dates look fine -- I hope that you have something fun planned!
26	The only slight glitch is that I will receive the bonus sheets on Monday, January 10 and that our turn around time is one day.
26	If it is convenient for you we can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.
26	I do not yet know at what time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.
26	--Sally
27	Thanks for being so prompt.
28	The address list on the memo below contains the names of all ENA Energy Operations employees who worked in the offices in Houston, Denver and Calgary on January 1st to test our systems.
28	Does it work for you to copy and paste this for Cliff's note?
28	Let me know if it would be better to provide this to you in a different way.
28	Thanks.
28	--Sally
29	Attached please find a completed employee profile for Brent Price for consideration for promotion to Vice President.
29	Please call me if you have any questions.
30	THE ATTACHED IS THE CORRECT VERSION.
30	Please disregard an earlier version of this form sent to Chris Shenkman by Dawn Doucet.
30	That version was not complete.
31	Please update my listing for direct reports.
31	Do you distribute a copy of this to my direct reports?
31	If so, please get an updated copy to them as well.
31	Thanks!
32	The industry quote below is interesting.
32	I have a call in to Bob to ask him to get you key measurements on EOL business to date.
32	--Sally
33	Preview of info request before targeted 4:30 PM meeting in my office today.
34	I believe that we may have a potentially good fit for Avril, but my direct report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town until Monday.
34	I will talk with him on Monday morning and I will have him visit with Jeff Sorenson, who previously interviewed Avril (he liked her and was favorably impressed, but had no position for her).
34	We may then want to be able to talk with Avril by phone, since a face-to-face interview will not be possible.
34	We should have a decision then very early in the week.
34	Since you will be in Houston I can update you in person.
34	I would not panic!
35	This includes OU and UT -- you can ignore the OU names, but there are some good students that I can introduce you to when they arrive!
36	John and I haven't talked about this need, but I will certainly think about any likely candidates.
36	Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.
36	He was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book administrator in a previous life.
36	Have you considered him?
36	Give me a couple of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get back with you.
36	--Sally
37	Attached is a memo that Rick plans to send out - I hope that attaching this makes it easy for you to take care of this.
37	I am delivering to him a highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes that I have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form.
37	He is certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out.
37	Call me with any questions.
38	Congratulations on your new role in the communciations company.
38	Building that business will be exciting and how great for the company that you will be there!
39	Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.
39	It is wonderful to see your contributions recognized in that way!
39	--Sally
40	Please take these meetings off my calendar.
40	Thanks!
41	Thanks for the note about the video conference.
41	I have put that date on my calendar and I am very interested in the discussion.
41	Any details on where I need to go in Houston to join in?
41	--Sally
42	This is the most immediate response that I have ever gotten on notes mail!
42	Just let me know and I will be there.
42	Thanks.
43	I liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning, as opposed to the signs for new hire orientation.
43	Just wanted to let you know that I noticed the difference!
43	I will be curious to hear about changes to the content as well.
43	Hope your are doing well.
43	We will have to have lunch after you get through January!
43	--Sally
44	It is officially on the way!
44	We will see how long it takes to get distributed.
44	--Sally
45	Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.
45	This memo will be sent by Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume with regard to global operations.
45	I shared this in the staff meeting so that you would be the first to know.
45	I will still fulfill my role within ENA as VP of Energy Operations.
45	I will not be going away!
45	This expanded responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the organization.
46	Thanks for the note, Sherri.
46	I know that you read notes mail messages very promptly!
46	--Sally
47	Thanks -- I now know that you read notes mail messages very promptly!
47	--Sally
48	Thanks for the note.
48	I hope that you are enjoying your role in EES.
49	Thanks for the note.
49	I am glad that you are enjoying Portland.
49	I am still on the 30th floor, so do drop by sometime when you are in town.
49	I would love to see you.
49	--Sally
50	I always have time for lunch!
50	I will ask my assistant to call you to set something up.
50	Thanks for your note.
50	--Sally
51	Thanks-- I think!
52	Please put my name on the list to attend this forum on Wednesday, January 26.
52	Thanks.
53	Please find out location of this conference call and put the details on my calendar.
53	Thanks.
53	-- Sally
54	Thanks for the note.
54	While most of my focus will be on ENA, it will be interesting to look at operations around the world.
55	Thanks for forwarding mail to me.
55	I apologize for the inconvenience of this.
55	My current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long name.
55	HOWEVER, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com.
55	That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation I am sure.
55	When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.
55	So I can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card.
55	SInce there are at least 2 sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between us?
55	That might help eliminate confusion going forward.
56	Thanks for your note!
56	--Sally
57	Please forward to James Scribner.
57	He will call with his e:mail address.
57	|
58	I can not attend as I will be in the London office for the remainder of the week.
58	Hope that all is well with you.
58	We will have to catch up soon.
59	Please join us for a celebration of Energy Operations promotions, hosted by ENA Energy Operations Management Team.
59	The following people will be honored at Irma's (22 N. Chenevert @ Franklin) on Thursday, February 3, 2000 from Brent Price Kristin Albrecht Brenda Herod Leslie Reeves Mary Solmonson Scott Pleus Sheri Thomas Bennett Kaufman Richard McKeel John Postlewaite Sylvia Campos Kam Keiser Phillip Love Anthony Campos Kori Loibl Trang Le Donnie Vinson Imelda Frayre Amy Degeyter Michael Nguyen Sherlyn Schumack Karie Hastings Leslie Smith Please RSVP by Friday, January 31 to Patti at ext.
59	39106 or e-mail reply.
59	Directions will be available Monday at Patti's desk (3012f).
59	Hope to see you there!
60	David, Can you resend 1/26/00 MPR?
60	I mistakingly deleted file before all worksheets were printed.
60	Thanks, Patti (Sally's assistant)
61	Approved.
61	Please process.
61	Thanks.
61	Sally Beck
62	FYI...Thanks for going.
62	--Sally
63	I will be attending a funeral in Austin on Thursday.
63	I can be reached on my cell phone (713-417-1951) in the morning and afternoon while driving to and from Austin.
63	If you need immediate information and I can not be reached on my cell phone, please contact Brent Price at x37647.
63	I will be back in the office on Friday.
64	The attachment on Ted's memo contains the list of students who will attend the luncheon tomorrow.
64	Thanks again for doing this!
64	--Sally
65	Approved.
65	Please process.
65	Thanks, Sally Beck
66	Brent & Peggy, Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions.
66	Sally made a beginning stab at it, but would like you to read over your segment and make any corrections or additions that you see fit (Peggy, in your case, can you fill in the blank).
66	When these are received back from you, I will call her (if it's this afternoon), and final copy will be distributed.
66	Thanks for your help.
66	Patti
67	It does work!
67	We enjoyed seeing you, also.
67	Thanks for letting us crash temporarily at your house.
68	This made it!
68	We are still waiting today to find out if we can get a Visa today.
68	If so, I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening.
68	If Chris' associate has any recommendations, I would love to hear them.
68	Thanks.
68	--Sally
69	Please distribute attached memo to all Enron North America employees.
69	If you need additional information, please call my assistant, Patti Thompson at ext.
69	Thank you, Sally Beck Vice President of Energy Operations
70	The draft of the memo looks good.
70	However, your memo says that the memo will be sent to all US employees of ENA.
70	ENA by definition includes Canada and Mexico.
70	Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those in the US.
70	Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees in Calgary.
70	I am at x35926 if you have any questions.
71	Friday won't work for me for lunch this week, but Thursday is open for me at this point.
71	Would that day work for you?
71	If lunch won't work, then we will plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday.
71	Let me know.
71	I will look forward to seeing you.
72	Thanks for keeping me posted on this.
72	Do let me know if there are further problems.
73	Friday at 2:00 pm --does that work for you?
73	--Sally
74	Please print a color copy of this for me.
74	Thanks.
75	Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.
75	You do an amazing job of balancing children and work, and contributing so much on your work on 133.
76	Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director.
76	That makes all of the life juggling seem a little more worthwhile, doesn't it?!
77	Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.
77	I follow your career within Enron with interest.
78	I won't be able to join Wanda and Juanita in Calgary next week.
78	I will find myself in South America next week, in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires.
78	Should be interesting, but a long flight.
78	I am cross referencing my calendar with your vacation days, and I will get back with you later today on a suggested date for a trip north.
79	FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my promotion memo from Energy Operations.
79	I believe that they both work under Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.
79	I am sure that they didn't mind having their names included twice in promotional memos!
79	Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she wondered if I would be coming.
79	I will be in South America in what should be summer there.
79	I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.
79	In addition to other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.
79	I hosted a happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.
80	Approved.
80	Please process.
80	Thanks, Sally Beck
81	I think that this was great, too.
81	I look forward to the next one.
81	Would you like to coordinate dinner plans for the next lecture?
82	I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a more manageable list) for this effort.
82	Since you went to the meeting I didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.
82	Just wanted to let you know that I have asked Patti to do this.
82	Thanks.
83	Kent, Please forward this to Sally Beck.
83	Thanks, Patti
84	Mike & Scott, Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way possible you could attend.
84	I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally going out of the country, things have been really hectic.
84	Sheila Glover will also be attending.
84	Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.
84	Thanks, Patti
85	Paige, Sheila Glover and Scott Earnest will be attending for Sally.
85	Mike Moscoso is out of town.
85	Patti
86	Sally asked me to forward this to you.
86	Patti
87	Another FAS 133 Offsite meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb 29 (all day).
87	Sally asked me to forward this to you - would like you to attend if at all possible.
87	Scott, this is an FYI for you - I know you will be overseas on this date.
87	Patti
88	Ted, Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.
88	Patti
89	Barry, Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.
89	A lot of people will be tied up all day Feb 29 at this offsite.
89	She would, however, like to set up time to meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.
89	Sally is available from 1:30 - 5:00 in the afternoon.
89	Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that will work for you.
89	Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 (Sally's Assistant)
90	Barry left me voicemail saying 1:30-2:30 pm would probably be okay - I will tentatively put that in Sally's calendar.
90	We can change later if need be.
90	Thanks, Patti
91	Approved.
91	Sally
92	I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review.
92	She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come to Calgary sometime after March 11.
92	I was in South America last week, and have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling reviews is a challenge this time around.
92	I will certainly get you a signed copy of the review as soon as I can.
93	Peggy Hedstrom will be out of the office from March 1 - 11 for vacation.
93	Our spring break week is March 13, so I have sent Peggy a note asking about sometime the week of March 20 or 27.
93	I will let you know her reply and then I would love to do a joint trip!
94	My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.
94	Gretchen Jennings in HR is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me.
94	She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those that responded to the posting.
94	I hope to start interviewing next week, although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.
94	Feel free to move forward with whatever you need to do.
94	I trust that I will have several good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.
94	I need to find out if she would like to be considered for the fulltime position.
95	Ted Murphy and I met this morning with the Arthur Andersen team that accompanied us to Sao Paulo.
95	We reviewed a summary of our observations and recommendations as a result of our visit.
95	After a few suggested changes, AA should forward a copy of this draft to you via e:mail later today.
95	We would welcome your comments on the document, and input on anything that you think we may have missed.
95	Ted and I will be reviewing this information with Rick Buy and Rick Causey as soon as a meeting can be scheduled, so your prompt comments or feedback would be welcomed.
96	Ted Murphy and I met with the Arther Andersen team this morning that accompanied us on our trip to Buenos Aires.
96	We reviewed the observations and recommendations in written form that we had discussed briefly with you on our last day your office.
96	After making a few changes, AA should be forwarding to you a copy of the draft document later this afternoon.
96	We would welcome your comments and your additions on anything that you think we may have missed.
96	Ted and I will be meeting with Rick Causey and Rick Buy within the next couple of days to discuss our operations and control review, so your responses would be welcomed prior to that meeting.
96	I look forward to working with you and others in your office in my role over Global Risk Management Operations.
96	In addition to overseeing common standards and controls for opeartional practices, I will work as your advocate for system and resource needs in order to insure success for your business plan in Buenos Aires.
97	Please print a color copy for me of the two attachments to Kate's memo.
97	Thanks.
98	With my recent travel, I am days (maybe weeks) behind on e:mail.
98	I didn't see my name on the attachment.
98	Do I have access to this?
99	Was it not January when we were back and forth and back and forth to London/Helsinki?
99	And despite the fact that the date sequence from London looks funny, it would seem that Nigel on the 17th of February is talking about beginning the process (actually debating the process) of background checks?
100	Rick: Sorry, I should have sent this to you several days ago.
100	Is the level of detail correct on these goals as you look to assimilate these with others?
100	I have stated the goals, but not the action plan to achieve the goals.
100	I am working on those in some detail right now.

105	I would definitely talk with Wes Colwell about doing the presentation on Business Analysis & Reporting.
105	I think that he would do a great job!
106	Please print 3 copies for me in color.
106	Thanks.
107	Am just back from Disneyworld (Tyler loved it, so you will have a great time in a few weeks) today, and I did get your message.
107	I will talk with Kristin this afternoon.
107	I agree that Edith would be great.
107	I will let you know if there is someone else that we can make available if Edith doesn't work.
107	I will leave you a message tonight before I go on status.
107	--Sally
108	Approved.
108	Sally Beck
109	Kevin Sweeney forwarded this message to me.
109	Fernley may have made you aware of his decision with Tani when you and he talked yesterday.
109	If not, I thought that you might be interested in this.
109	--Sally
110	FYI - This should make things easier in London as there will be one point person to focus on global.
110	I am not sure that her background will bring a lot to the table in the early stages, but she did seem sharp when I met with her last week.
110	This announcement did surprise me a bit, as when I last talked with Fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing Tani in this role.
110	---Sally
111	I was forwarded a copy of Fernley's announcement regarding your new role foGlobal Products Trading Support.
111	Your discussions in Houston last week mushave swayed you to accept the challenges that are there.
111	Congratulations oyour new role.
111	As you step into your new position, please let me know how I can best support you in my role over Global Risk Management Operations.
111	I am forwarding a copy of the announcement regarding my expanded role that wassent out in January.
111	Assuming that you were not paying particular attentioto trading operations issues at that point in time, this may be one of those:mail messages that you skipped.
111	I thought that it might be helpful for yto understand the focus that I will have in working with trading operationsgroups around the globe.
111	I certainly will look forward to working with youTim and Kevin.
111	I understand that Kevin will move into a role that is focused full-time onsystems implementation.
111	Who will assume the day-to-day lead responsibilityfor Global Products trading operations in Houston and how will that individual report in to you?
111	I will be in the London office during the week of March 20.
111	I will leaveHouston on Sunday evening, so that I should be in the office by noon on Monday.
111	I plan to be there through Thursday evening.
111	Let me know if youwill be in town that week, so that we can schedule some time together.
111	--Sally
112	Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might interest you.
112	The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me.
112	James and I worked together previously at a bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.
112	When I asked if he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.
112	His read is that she is very bright, creative, and innovative.
112	She has worked on many special projects at Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special projects.
112	I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.
112	If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral along to other HR groups.
112	FYI - James will start work here on April 3.
113	Thanks for your homework on this.
113	We will definitely take a look at these two places next week while we are in London.
113	Let us know what we need to do to schedule this.
113	I look forward to meeting you.
113	One of your earlier messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.
113	Monday is great, but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting.
113	Brent and I will be on the flight that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 10:00 AM.
113	By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.
113	Do you have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?
113	Thanks.
113	--Sally
114	We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.
114	I view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.
114	ENA is picking up the cost associated with the family.
114	Sounds as if I need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that handled.
114	That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.
114	Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.
114	Monday is actually the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.
114	The Astros play St. Louis on both of those days., both evening games.
114	I would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games.
114	Just let me know whether you actually want the 10th or the 12th.
114	We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.
114	I would love to see Jo as well.
114	We will have to work the details.
114	I am planning to be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.
114	I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there.
114	--Sally
115	3PM sounds great.
115	I will look forward to meeting you.
116	Have fun in San Antonio.
116	It is a very popular spring break destination.
116	Enjoy it!
117	Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.
117	Wanted to see if you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.
117	We arrive on Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning.
117	Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.
117	But Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are available.
117	Does it work for you with the baby to do evenings?
117	Let me know.
118	I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and I had asked her to arrange a lunch with you and Brent, plus some time for just the two of us to get together.
118	We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).
118	That will include a look at Continental power, UK power, UK gas and global products.
118	Looks as if sometime in April will be the date for that, however, not next week.
118	--Sally
119	I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to Houston next week.
119	My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it looks as if we will miss one another.
119	My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.
119	I will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting.
119	This is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities.
120	Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday morning and returning to Houston on Friday.
120	The purpose of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role, I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired.
120	Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.
120	We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.
120	My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.
120	Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.
120	I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations.
120	My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.
120	I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.
120	I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products.
120	I have not heard from Tani, but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.
120	It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.
120	I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products.
120	I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.
120	I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London.
120	I look forward to meeting with you next week.
120	This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton's request.
120	By circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.
120	There will be a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.
120	The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position.
120	It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April.
120	Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.
120	We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.
120	Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.
120	The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore.
120	The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.
120	I can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week).
120	We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.
120	They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.
121	1) I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.
121	This draft now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday. You and John should receive those drafts today. 2) I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was asking).
121	I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am there.
121	3) To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are the following: Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of the details on having support personnel in London Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston) Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective trading operations and controls world-wide I look forward to seeing you next week.
122	I'll look forward to seeing you.
122	Since my first note, I have scheduled a dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on Thursday but booked that day.
122	With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that leaves Monday or Wednesday.
122	I hope that one of those days works for you and Frank.
122	I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today.
122	--Sally
123	Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report on the operations/controls review of Singapore.
123	(It is an attachment to the message from Scott Earnest to me.) The most current drafts of the reports on Oslo and Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.
123	Nick Swingler is apparently out on vacation this week.
123	I have asked AA personnel from Houston to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft reports.
123	Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via e:mail from AA on Wednesday.
123	--Sally
124	I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday this week (March 15-17).
124	I will be with my children while they are on Spring Break.
124	I can be reached those three day either at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).
124	The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the office while I am out: Key Operations Contacts March 15-17 Brent Price Business Controller, Gas x37647 Kristin Albrecht Business Controller, Power x34763 Also, I will be in the London office during the week of March 20th.
124	I am working with Fernley Dyson and John Sherriff to structure training and orientation for a new head of trading operations that has been hired in London.
124	I am also working to provide transition resources to London for operational controls unttil the new guy is on board.
124	My work on this should be completed by the end of next week.
124	I will return to Houston on Friday, March 24.
124	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have a copy of my schedule while I am in London as well as an international mobile phone number where I can be reached.
124	Please don't hesitate to call.
124	I will be responding to voice mail messages throughout the week.
124	The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the Houston office while I am working from London: Key Operations Contacts March 20-24 Brenda Herod Business Controller, Gas x35778 Kristin Albrecht Business Controller, Power x34763 Kristin Albrecht will attend the Monday, March 20th staff meeting at 9:30 in my absence.
125	The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey, so you were dropped from the first distribution.
125	I have to remember to type your full first name!
126	I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with my children during part of their spring break.
126	We will be in town, so I can be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).
126	I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once or twice a day.
126	I will be in the London office next week.
126	I will be in that office from about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.
126	Patti will have a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the trip.
126	Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.
126	I will be responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.
126	I will be travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London around 1 AM Houston time).
126	I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27.
127	Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies in which Enron holds an ownership interest.
127	Attached is a copy of that schedule.
127	Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.
127	You will note that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.
127	We have identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA.
128	I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the attachment.
128	If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.
128	Are you trying to create a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in Japan?
128	Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a position on the Tokyo team?
128	Is this a job description that you want to use in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the risk books?
128	These three options would all require slightly different descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use this.
128	Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.
129	DISCUSSION DRAFT TO: Enron Europe Employees FROM: Fernley Dyson, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, EEL Sally Beck, Vice President ) Global Risk Management Operations SUBJECT: Trading Operations Resource for London Enron Europe Ltd. has played a vital role over the last few years in the global expansion of Enron,s business.

136	Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this season.
136	One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is two tickets in the terrace level.
136	I have also purchased one parking spot in a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.
136	I have divided the tickets among you, with my husband's help.
136	He identified "good games" (i.e. teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across my direct reports.
136	Tickets for the other games have been distributed based your percentage of Energy Operations employees.
136	For most games, you will receive all six tickets.
136	You can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.
136	The parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.
136	Patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.
136	Your tickets will be distributed to you this week.
136	I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these.
136	I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.
136	I have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy Operations who are not my direct reports.
136	SInce you will have first call on the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.
136	I wanted to make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.
136	Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a weekday afternoon and one a weekend.
136	I will let you know these dates soon, as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games.
137	Do you know what this is?
137	ISO makes me think power.
137	Any clues?
137	--Sally
138	Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in London.
138	Any comments would be appreciated.
138	Fernley and I plan to send this out sometime next week, prior to Brent's assignment starting on April 10.
139	Glad you enjoyed the game.
139	That was quite a climb to those seats!
139	I did it a couple of times with my two year old in arms, and wasn't sure that I would make it!
139	That's good that you could watch from a lower level.
139	--Sally
140	Below is an announcement that was sent to employees within Enron Europe todfrom Fernley Dyson and me.
140	Most of you have probably become aware of theassignment that Brent will have over the next few months in London.
140	We anticipate that he will be back in the Houston office by the end of the second quarter.
140	I thought that you would like to see how we have describedthe role that he will play in London.
140	Brent will retain his current role within North America, and will be conducting his Houston staff meetings via conference call from London.
140	Susan Harrison and Steve Jackson will play leadership roles for his gas team whilhe is in London; Susan with a focus on operations and Steve with a focus orisk and interfacing with Jeff Shankman's on daily p&l and position information.
140	needs.
140	Please wish Brent well in this additional assignment in London.
140	I would asthat you help defeat the "out of sight, out of mind" syndrome, and that youkeep Brent informed of ENA issues as you would if he were in town, via e:mail or telephone.
140	Also, please work closely with Susan and Steve when you aredealing with issues that cut across commodity lines.
140	Susan will be attending the Monday afternoon staff meeting.
141	Glad you enjoyed the game.
141	It was certainly a panoramic view from up there!
141	I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to Enron, and I am certainly glad that you are here.
142	I will look forward to meeting you during your visit to Houston next week.
142	I will work with Carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us.
142	Have a nice flight.
142	--Sally
143	We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.
143	Interviewers were Gene Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.
143	The four of us met this morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.
143	Based on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners.
143	I conveyed this via voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.
143	She had told me that her schedule would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow morning.
143	She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.
143	I would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.
143	However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation.
143	She will most likely then contact you to confirm their names.
143	I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official notification from the University takes place.
143	Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin if schedules permit.
143	The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the dinner.
143	Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.
143	I know that Rick Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he may be available).
143	I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she would like to be included if her schedule permits.
143	Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.
143	Let me know how I can help with these arrangements.
143	Enron North America Corp.
144	I already have this date on my calendar.
144	Count me in. --Sally
145	Glad you enjoyed the game.
145	The field will make baseball much more fun in Houston.
146	Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.
146	I would like to bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week.
146	--Sally
147	I have asked Patti to get us together to discuss your e:mail message as soon as possible.
147	Hopefully, we can work that out this week.
147	I llok forward to talking with you and I will be glad to help you in any way that I can.
148	The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.
148	I will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do it.
148	I will let you know.
148	The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.
148	So if that works for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.
148	Keep me posted.
148	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
149	Fall sounds good to me.
149	In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and that it will most likely be another week before he does so.
149	I asked her to contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.
149	I will keep Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) updated on the timing of notifying the winners.
149	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
150	Willie Harrell Security Request approved.
150	Sally Beck
151	Thanks for the update.
151	I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get together.
151	Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.
151	When that is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.
151	Hope your weekend was a good one.
151	Have you seen Brent yet?
151	--Sally
152	Approved.
152	Sally Beck System would not allow me to submit request electronically.
153	Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 2000 plan.
154	I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.
154	Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to transfer my call into voice mail.
154	They were good about answering your phone, however!
154	I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.
154	If I miss you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.
154	I will be in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can easily step out to talk with you.
155	We would love to see all three of you.
155	Sounds as if you might arrive on Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.
155	You can see the kitchen in progress!!
155	The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can make yourselves at home.
155	I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all be glad to see you.
155	I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might change her plans.
155	I will try to catch her tonight.
155	Just let me know on the $'s.
155	I can send that whenever you might need it.
155	And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as you all get caught up on other things.
155	No rush.
155	Love, Sally
156	Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.
156	Thanks.
157	I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.
157	However, in my staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for EOL access.
157	We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.
157	Susan needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager should okay this as well.
157	--Sally
158	Approved.
158	Sally Beck
159	I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.
159	Below are my suggested seven appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.
159	I made the selections based on their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc. I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today.
159	Analyst School Current Rotation Rationale Ilan Caplan UT CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations Erin Rice Trinity CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the solution; female minority Brian Hoskins Vanderbilt ENA Trading I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one Alejandro Veiga Rice ESA - Venezula Good ideas; diverse background Courtney Votaw Pepperdine Corp. - PR Adds interest to the mix with her rotation & background Adrian Woolcock Rice EES Sounds mature; good ideas
160	Kim, Sally says that Wes Colwell will be assigning ENA representative.
160	Patti
161	We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.
161	I have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.
161	Upon the recommendation of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the manager of the West region.
162	Charlene: Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.
162	I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.
162	Background: As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program.
162	Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.
162	It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.
162	I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner.
162	Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.
162	The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following: Brenda Herod ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU Brent Price ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT Jeff Sommers CALME Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida Ed Coats Corp. Tax Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of Florida Sally Beck ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU Carolyn Barrett EBS Howard Selzer Enron Global E&P Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points: One program, or two: Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an announcement was made that there would be one analyst program.
162	Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.
162	In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.
162	We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus.
162	SIngle start date: The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.
162	The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May.
162	Lack of communication: We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program.
162	We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts or details.
162	Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some had not.
162	Commercial focus too heavy: Presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.
162	Lack of input from biggest supporters: Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program.
162	We are concerned that decisions (example: the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.
162	MSAP has taken a step backward: Previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program.
162	We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.
162	Summary Concerns/Discussion Points: Disc
163	Approved.
163	Sally Beck
164	Sounds like a good idea.
164	I am glad to Theresa is getting some benefit from the program.
164	--Sally
165	Sounds interesting, and Scottsdale is supposed to be nice.
165	Enjoy!
166	Do you want to give your tickets to someone in your group and join the management team?
166	Up to you...
166	Enron North America Corp.
167	You have a ticket - we will see you there, with you pager on!
167	Patti will get your ticket to you before Thursday.
168	I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program.
168	Keep me posted on date and time.
168	Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday.
168	I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be involved and provide support for your efforts.
168	--Sally
169	Thanks for your note.
169	Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today.
169	I realized after you left that we did not talk about compensation.
169	It would help me in creating this role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.
169	We have a good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking for in making a move.
169	Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.
169	My number is 713-853-5926.
169	--Sally
170	Tara, When I tried to approve this request (Sheri gave verbal approval), I got message that it had already been approved by another access approver.
170	Patti
171	We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.
171	I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.
171	My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like a very long ten day stay.
171	He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight!
171	Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward.
171	Thanks for asking.
171	--Sally
172	It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct reports.
172	Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.
172	To meet at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the day for some groups to lose assistants.
172	Would it work to start a little later in the afternoon?
172	If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure time.
172	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
173	Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.
173	Since Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition: Example: Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.
173	He will be transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce assumes his responsibilities for EBS.
173	The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May.
173	I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.
173	So sounds as if that is clarified.
174	Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not get the message from Tammy.
174	Lots of catch up in the office last week, which will continue this week.
174	I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.
174	We are starting to talk birthday with Meagan now.
174	I will get back with you in a couple of days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.
174	Thanks for asking.
174	--Sally
175	Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town.
175	Leave room for the pie!
175	Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a time for you or you and Chris to visit.
175	( I will keep that date confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.) --Sally
176	Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail ?
176	There was not one attached.
177	Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.
177	Got your message last Friday.
177	It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim Fallon.
177	The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.
177	May be the end of this week, may be next week.
177	I think it will still be good for you and Kristin to talk in person.
177	Kristin and Todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both.
177	Kristin's established working relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.
177	I don't want to lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same time.
177	So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.
177	I got your message on housing/location in Houston.
177	I am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.
177	I will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some options on housing.
178	I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.
178	He is the most appropriate respondent from ENA.
178	--Sally
179	I understand that Ashley Worthing has been hired by Enron to start work this summer.
179	I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M.
179	She is my cousin's daughter, so I am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an analyst.
179	Please let me know if that is the case.
179	Thanks.
180	FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.
180	We have pushed the date several times.
180	If there are some other delays, you may want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then returning on your own to finish the project.
180	You could stay in a hotel from that time period.
180	What do you think?
180	Can we assure Tom that you will be out of the flat by the 18th of May?
180	--Sally
181	FYI - Let's talk.
181	I am already booked for Tuesday AM - could you attend and would you want to?
181	Let's talk before getting back to Margaret.
181	--Sally
182	You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!
182	But that's what she would like.
182	She will be really pleased.
182	She loves her silver ones, but they are not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.
182	Sounds as if your weekend was fun.
182	Ours was nice --errands and stuff on Saturday and the Enron picnic at Astroworld on Sunday.
182	Otherwise, just camping out in the mess at our house.
182	I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist.
182	Sounds as if from her ER buddy at the Heart Hospital that she has decided that they need both -- one for counseling and one for meds.
182	I believe that she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.
182	I hope that they will begin to find some relief.
182	Sounds as if they are really having a hard time - at least Mom.
182	We would still like for you to come visit.
182	Let's talk dates when you're ready.
182	--Sally
183	He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.
183	He reports to Scott Mills, who is the user lead for the project.
183	I am copying Scott on this message, as his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.
183	I suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.
183	--Sally
184	Stephen joined Enron on January 29, 1996.
184	Is there any other info that you need?
184	Are you still planning to be in Houston next week?
184	--Sally
185	Please print the attachment for me in color.
185	Maybe three copies.
185	Thanks.
186	Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.
186	Then Meagan leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.
186	If we decide to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or July 10.
186	After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.
186	Looks as if we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at camp.
186	Let me know when you want to talk dates.
187	I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.
187	At an ENA offsite meeting on Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead.
187	Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.
187	So rather than discuss the transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.
187	He had some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer months would be risky for ENA.
187	You and I can discuss those if you would like.
187	His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".
187	He and Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.
187	Let's discuss.
187	--Sally
188	Below is the name and phone number of the woman that I worked with to arrange our tour of Enron Field.
188	She may not be the person to talk with regarding displaying a boat, but will very likely be able to give the correct contact.
188	It was nice to meet you.
188	I have enjoyed getting to know Bethany through NCL.
188	Good luck!
188	Jill McCormick
189	I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.
189	I have not talked directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this afternoon.
189	I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message after that.
189	--Sally
190	I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear Julie Andrews speak.
190	Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as our daughters.
190	So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High School with Meagan.
190	Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.
190	I hope that all of you enjoy the evening.
190	The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next Tuesday, May 16.
190	Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot for dinner.
190	That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.
190	I can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, motivated women!
190	I will look forward to introducing her to those of you whom she has not yet met.
191	Well done!
191	Beth will be a great resource.
191	--Sally
192	This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource.
192	Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.
192	Let me know how I can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.
192	I was impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.
192	--Sally
193	Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.
193	Your leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation in ENA's business.
193	However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future.
193	--Sally
194	Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.
194	I didn't realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be seeing more of you in Houston.
194	I look forward to working with you when you arrive.
195	Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.
195	I look forward to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management operations initiatives.
195	I talk with Brent Price several times a week.
195	I know that Fernley has appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his involvement to be beneficial as well.
195	We are almost at the half way mark on his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary to get your input on his role to date.
196	Mary, As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison as a signer.
196	Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume Management groups.
196	This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.
196	Thanks, Sally
197	Irena, Can you attach file?
197	Patti Enron North America Corp.
198	Thanks for the reminders.
198	Hopefully, this will take care of this.
199	Thanks for the update and attachment.
199	It will be great to have you back here in Houston.
199	I have heard lots of good things about your assignment there, however, so I know that the London group will miss your presence.
199	I will try to call you Wednesday morning on my way into the office.
199	I.
200	Approved.
200	Please process.
200	Sally Beck
201	Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.
201	I am glad that you are eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for Tuesday, however.
201	I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.
201	9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.
201	There are two other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.
201	One is a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.
201	I will give the details on location and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.
201	Enjoy your next few days.
201	I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday.
201	Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.
201	I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
201	--Sally
202	I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way to handle this.
202	And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.
202	My expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.
202	This finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.
202	I will be on vacation on Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me.
202	--Sally
203	Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.
203	I will be out on vacation on Monday.
203	Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one of my daughters.
203	I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.
203	I will get back in touch if the Tuesday lunch does open up.
203	Would Amita like to meet at another time during those days?
203	There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on Tuesday evening.
203	How does that work with Amita's schedule?
203	--Sally
204	FYI -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing.
204	Thanks.
205	According to records from the Analysts Program, the following interns will be working within Energy Operations during the summer.
205	The assignment stated below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet.
205	Name School Start Date Assignment Luna Carlson University of Florida July 5 ENA - Risk Reporting and Analysis Joshua Koenig University of Florida May 22 Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management Jolly Jose University of Houston June 5 Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management Michael Taylor LSU May 22 Central Desk Logistics Daniel Graham Morehouse May 15 ENA - Financial Settlements Angelique Woods University of Texas May 22 ENA - Risk Management First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.
205	Hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk, phone and computers for all.
205	Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to Enron.
205	Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer.
205	I welcome ideas on this from any of you.
206	My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for operations for all trading/origination locations started with Enron yesterday.
206	Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.
206	She was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is one.
206	I will have her contact you later today.
206	Although she is new to Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the US and in Europe.
206	She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.
206	--Sally
207	I have this on my calendar for September 7 and I am looking forward to it.
207	Thanks.
208	I have signed up for June 1st.
208	There is no indication on the e:mail that you forwarded of the location for the focus group.
208	I assume that more details will follow.
209	Congratulations on the new role.
209	I think that it will be an interesting challenge and that you will do a great job.
209	How soon do you start?
209	--Sally
210	FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.
210	We are following up on her leads for talent.
210	--Sally
211	I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring.
211	Here is her response.
211	Tony Vasut had called her and asked for this list as well.
211	Do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel?
211	Or is he working on some other initiative?
211	I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.
211	--Sally
212	Per my voice mail...somehow my intent to copy you on this didn't work.
212	Shona's extension is 39123 and she is sitting on the 30th floor.
212	--Sally
213	Please print for me on legal size paper.
213	Thanks.
214	I assume that granting access for someone for whom Lorraine Becker is the supervisor should be approved by you.
214	I get hundreds of these, many for employees outside Energy Operations.
214	Thanks.
214	--Sally
215	Ditto.
216	Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is in the London office now is Brent Price.
216	I looked up Scott's name on our Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.
216	I assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with Mark Pickering in IT in London.
216	My role in Houston is over the trading operations groups, but does not include IT.
216	I wish that I could answer your specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you the answer that you need.
217	Happy anniversary!
217	I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.
217	Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting Amanda ready for camp.
217	There was still a good bit of painting going on this week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.
217	We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is having fun.
217	Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.
217	Has some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.
217	I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.
217	As we discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend.
217	So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a total for gifts for both girls.
217	Love, Sally
218	I have entered the following names into the Performance Review System as suggested reviewers: Commercial Customers Jeff Shankman Jim Fallon Gary Hickerson Direct Reports Brent Price (Business Controller -Natural Gas) Kristin Albrecht (Business Controller - Power) Todd Hall (Business Controller - Merchant Portfolio) Others Rick Causey Ted Murphy Fernley Dyson (London)
219	That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.
219	I apologize if I seemed impatient in the meeting.
219	I know that you are working for the best interests of Energy Operations and Enron.
219	By the end of the day I was probably looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend itself well to that.
219	Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to talk separate from immediate issues at hand?
219	I will have Patti get a date on the calendar.
219	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
220	I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let her know.
220	They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.
220	Can you verify that Sheila received those from me?
220	Thanks.
220	--Sally
221	Please pring attached presentation for me in color.
221	Thanks.
222	My trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the ballroom at the Rice.
222	Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial reporting, etc. In addition to managing these databases, Mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.
222	This tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.
222	This project, Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter.
222	We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week.
222	Please let me know if you are interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.
222	Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity.
223	I didn't know about this one.
223	I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one and I will get back to you in a day or so.
223	We'll save the Scott Mills discussion for a later date!
223	On another note, I enjoyed lunch today.
223	Let me know when you want to get out of the building again sometime.
223	--Sally
224	I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.
224	I had put her on the list of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.
224	He had asked about someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.
224	I don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call.
224	What is she going to do for you in gas?
224	We may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has been as involved with EOL.
224	--Sally
225	We have lunch scheduled for June 22, according to my calendar.
225	I am looking forward to it.
225	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
226	We willl consider that a rain check.
226	Just let know in a cooler month when you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to play.
226	Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in Calgary the last time.
226	If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.
226	Just give me a call at x35926.
226	--Sally
227	Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.
227	(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.) That is probably what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.
227	I will assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.
227	Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.
227	We need to talk about this business and the best way to support it.
227	Have you had any conversations with Jeff on this?
228	I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.
228	First, who is Doug Imrie?
228	Does he have a strong background in trading operations?
228	Will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business?
228	I think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing.
228	It should encompass assessing people, processes, controls, systems support, etc. To do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations.
228	I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis.
228	Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York offices.
228	From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility.
228	Again, I don't know Andy.
228	Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience?
228	I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well.
229	I hope that your holiday was wonderful.
229	Nikki told me that you would be working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.
229	I will try to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.
229	I start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 to about 7:15.
229	I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.
229	I don't think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of June 27.
229	Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?
229	I have scheduled dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the trip.
229	Just let me know.
229	Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?
229	Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG acquisition.
229	That should make life fun for you!
229	I wanted to talk about resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence efforts and longer term in the assimilation.
229	As in my voice mail, I believe that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they run their business.
229	It seems that might help jump start the plans around how best to assimilate the business.
229	I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and in other locations.
229	Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell who seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.
229	I don't know the names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.
229	We can hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.
230	I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.
230	I completed the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral.
230	I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in Energy Operations.
230	Analysts Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add more strength to this group Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants to trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk books; we could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role, if appropriate Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work experience and fit) Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a direct hire Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience Associates Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from Energy Operations interviewed him or her) Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations Let me know about next steps in this process.
230	I would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth.
231	I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for clarification around the LNG business.
231	As soon as I hear back from him I will let you know, and then based on that info we can decide on best next steps.
232	We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.
232	Glad we could work out a date.
233	Thanks for confirming Mark's participation.
233	Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, will be sending information to your attention on the following: Specifics on location of meeting at Rice Hotel Attendee list (names, titles, operating companies) Brief background on Mary Solmonson's Global Database Management Group Suggested talking points for Mark's talk Agenda for the meeting We will be sure to get this informaiton to you by Friday of this week, so that you can provide Mark with a copy when he is in the London office on Monday.
233	Thanks for your help--Sally
234	I meant to send this to you.
234	--Sally
235	Thanks for the info on your trip.
235	Have a great time -- I will be anxious to hear about the presentation in Natchez.
235	Love, Sally
236	Buried with Shankman today.
236	I will e:mail you tomorrow.
237	Hi, Mike.
237	It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my hope is that you have already headed home today.
237	I would love to visit with you.
237	Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday?
237	Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.
237	I would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) tomorrow.
237	My car phone number is 713-417-1591.
237	A few weeks ago I put together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to Houston.
237	Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you.
237	It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given the time difference.
237	I will look forward to speaking with you.
237	I understand that your value in the office is already felt.
237	--Sally
238	Approved.
238	Please process.
238	Thanks, Sally Beck
239	I will be out of the office after noon on Friday, June 9, headed to the hill country to pick up one of my daughters from camp.
239	I will not attend the Friday afternoon meeting.
239	You will be able to reach me on my cell phone, 713-417-1591, as needed during the afternoon.
240	This reporting tool looks very useful.
240	I am glad to know that you are managing with this on a regular basis.
240	Do we have a well-defined follow-up process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?
240	This is a great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.
240	It would be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this.
240	Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are doing confirmations?
240	I would include Global Products as well.
240	--Sally
241	I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the impact of the prospect of losing him.
241	I am forwarding this to Brent to get his assessment of the impact.
241	I do know that the number of deals that we do currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is stretched right now.
241	Again, though, Brent would best be able to address this.
241	As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as needed at home for his wife.
241	For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.
241	Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob.
241	--Sally
242	They all made me laugh out loud.
242	I am glad that they all were able to get up!
242	Thanks.
243	I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the MG aquisition and assimilation.
243	Would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?
243	I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.
243	However, in my role over Global Risk Management Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.
243	Brent Price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date.
243	His return soon to Houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill.
243	Thanks in advance to your attention to this.
244	Bob is a good, solid player.
244	He won't change the world, but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done.
244	I personally like Bob a lot, and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.
244	His wife has MS in its most severe stages.
244	He was a manager previously, and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.
244	He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.
244	I made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will personally make sure that works for him.
244	I would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.
244	Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved.
244	I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that.
244	I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that they are not long on people.
244	I assume that Danny is following up with Brent.
244	--Sally
245	Thanks for the offer.
245	I will take you up on it.
245	Can you get a list of recent OU grads hired at Enron?
245	I have the list of summer interns from OU.
245	I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the cookout.
245	I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.
245	How does that date work for you?
245	I assume that summer interns will still be with us then.
245	What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?
245	David will of course be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for them.
245	We can make this work either way.
245	Do you think that people would prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.
245	I will take your suggestion on this one.
245	After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.
245	Thanks for the help.
245	--Sally
246	Enjoy the time off!
246	Just let us know when that week comes who your in charge person will be.
246	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
247	Thanks for your front-end research on this.
247	It's too bad that the training provider can't be as responsive!
247	In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is an eternity.
247	Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.
247	Our audience for this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away from the desk is not very workable either.
247	After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.
247	Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this decision?
247	Thanks.
247	--Sally
248	Thanks for the response.
248	I will look for your list so that I can send out invitations.
248	--Sally
249	Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife, too.
249	I thought that I might also invite Ted Jacobs if he plans to be in Houston that weekend.
249	Do you have an e:mail address for him?
249	Thanks.
250	I know that Amanda will enjoy seeing you next week.
250	Thanks for making some time for her.
250	Let's definitely schedule a return trip for the two of you with some golf/cart time!
251	UGH!!
251	I am happy for you, but know that Enron will be losing as you leave.
251	I am pleased that the opportunity at Reliant is an exciting one for you, and I know that you will do a great job.
251	It has been fun to work with you, Ginger, and I too will miss that.
251	Best of luck to you!
251	--Sally
252	FYI - This came as a surprise to me.
252	Didn't know whether or not you knew about GInger's departure.
252	--Sally
253	Thanks for the update.
253	I want to send her some flowers at the house.
253	Can you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?
253	Thanks.

256	I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join me for lunch on Friday, June 30.
256	I have made reservations for 11:45 am at Nino's on West Dallas.
256	I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.
256	We will provide transporation to and from lunch.
256	Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you can attend.
256	Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, will join us for lunch.
256	Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.
256	He will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.
256	James Scribner, a Senior Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.
256	James will be helping us with our OU recruiting efforts.
256	Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's recruiting efforts in the future at OU.
257	Thanks for the input.
257	It is just in time -- I attend Rick Causey's cross functional PRC for Directors and above tomorrow.
257	I think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on July 6.
257	I look forward to catching up then.
257	--Sally
258	Let's book Friday, July 21 for this lunch.
258	I will work on further details.
258	Thanks, Sharron.
259	It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.
259	I will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an on-going resource for operations in London.
259	If you are comfortable with my idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this week.
259	We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.
260	Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I have spent three (!!!) full days in PRC meetings since then.
260	I have shared your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be of help.
260	Sorry that I keep missing your calls.
260	I will be meeting with Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow.
261	There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.
261	I asked Jody's opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his answer was yes.
261	So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.
261	I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the Analyst Program that will be covering OU.
261	Have you decided on the make-up of the recruiting team at OU in the fall?
261	If so, this might be a good event in which to include them as well.
261	I left you a voice mail message about James Scribner as a potential good member of the team.
261	Let me know your thoughts and I can include anyone else that you would like.
261	I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7.
262	Attached is Bob Superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today.
262	We do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.
262	On those pipes where the nom type is "Intraday", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work through.
262	The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms were late.
262	Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today.
262	Let me know if you have any questions.
262	--Sally
263	I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.
263	Pulp & paper is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.
263	I would not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.
263	We did review him in our PRC.
263	For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they took I believe without any outside direction.
263	Does this make sense to you?
263	--Sally
264	I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.
264	Since I'm not sure what that is it probably means that I don't have one!
264	So we probably do need to schedule a photographer.
264	I will be in the office next week, Wednesday through Friday.
264	Then I will be on vacation the week of July 10th.
264	Let me know when the photographer will come, so that I will know what to wear!
264	Thanks, and have a great long weekend.
264	--Sally
265	Welcome to Enron.
265	I'm glad that you made the decision to come here.
265	Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of time!
265	Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.
265	They know more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.
265	They both report to me.
265	Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations.
265	They can help you on any details about our power business.
265	My office is on the 30th floor - EB3015.
265	Stop by if you get the chance.
265	I will be moving to the 33rd floor during the week of July, actually while I am on vacation.
265	Have a great long weekend.
265	--Sally
266	End of July should be fine.
266	I am planning to be out July 26, 27 and 28, taking our 16 year-old on a tour of some college campuses before she starts her junior year.
266	Motivational, I hope!
266	--Sally
267	Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.
267	I will also ask my assistant to deliver a hard copy to you on Wednesday, July 5.
267	Let me know if you have any questions or need more information.
267	Thanks.
268	Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.
268	I should have had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.
268	Hopefully, better late than never.
268	I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late July for VP's.
268	I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA PRC which will take place on July 7.
268	I thought that I would provide you a copy as well.
268	I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week.
269	What do these changes do to you?
269	--Sally
270	Home and cell phone number are correct.
270	I do not have a pager.
270	--Sally
271	This looks good.
271	Please send this wherever it should go.
271	Thanks.
272	Lunch on August 2nd works well for me.
272	I have it on the calendar.
272	I am planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns from OU and recent hires from OU.
272	Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us.
272	If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too.
272	Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics.
272	Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.
272	Let me know if you will be in town.
272	--Sally
273	As mentioned, I will be out on vacation next week.
273	This contact list should be helpful if you need anything while I am out.
273	--Sally
274	Just a reminder about my being on vacation next week.
274	I also wanted to let you know that I gave your names as contacts while I am out!
274	--Sally
275	Just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week.
275	I am still at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that I can head home and pack.
275	I will call when we are back in Houston on Sunday, July 16.
275	Mom and Dad, hope that you have fun if you are going on your trip!

276	I heard from Andrew regarding the status of a business continuity plan.
276	Attached is a short presentation that he sent me that I thought you would like to see.
276	Any interest in meeting with Andrew to get more detail?
276	I plan to get with him.
276	Let me know and I will be glad to set something up.
277	Brenda: I mentioned to Tom that I will be on vacation the week of July 10, so I will not attend the July 12th meeting.
277	Please remind him of that.
277	Thanks.
277	Brenda Flores-Cuellar@ENRON
278	Just a reminder for Monday to get this for me.
278	Too bad they didn't deliver these!
278	Thanks.
278	--Sally
279	Today was the final ENA PRC.
279	Relative ranking results up through the Senior Director level are final.
279	You and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees.
279	I spoke with Sheila Walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews.
279	She indicated that the target completion date should be the end of July.
279	Promotions will be effective August 1st.
279	It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.
279	This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.
279	I do not yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.
279	I will keep you updated on this as I get direction from him.
279	Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.
279	In order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews.
279	It is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews.
279	It is important to note, however, that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view of that employee's relative ranking.
279	In other words, an employee in the Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job.
279	Clearly, a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc. Also please note the following: Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given to the employees.
279	This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee.
279	(This has been the stated process for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process as well.) Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team, or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback.
279	I believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations.
279	I ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment.
279	Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a meaningful one.
279	It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0
280	Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room in EB50M.
280	Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been invited to join us as well.
280	We are interested in renewing acquaintances with those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom we did not see in the interview process.
280	We hope that you are enjoying your summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit over lunch.
280	Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch.
281	Rob: Let me know if you get feedback from AEC that does not indicate that they are getting what they need.
281	Susan and Bryce are both very capable and responsive, so I am confident that AEC's questions can be resolved quickly.
281	--Sally
282	Thanks for the update.
282	I am confident that with leadership from you and attention from Bryce that AEC will be satisfied soon.
282	--Sally
283	I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late afternoon.
283	More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the date so that you can hold this on your calendar.
283	I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.
283	And my husband will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners!
284	Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.
284	All VP's will be reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.
284	Representatives at that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Greg Piper.
284	They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.
284	I have provided copies of your accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey for reference during that process.
284	Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be completed before the end of July.
284	I will schedule an August date with you for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.
284	Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact course that is required of VP's.
284	I thought that the course was very good.
284	All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.
284	It is a 2 or 3 day course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.
284	I would contact Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.
285	James, I didn't see your name on the distribution for this so I'm forwarding it to you.
285	Patti
286	Per Sally's instructions - I am forwarding this document to you.
286	Patti x39106
287	Thanks for the note.
287	I had received a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor ?Evaluation Form.
287	Today I also met with Jim and he provided me with his ?bullet points on your accomplishments and strengths, as well as your summary ?of accomplishments for the period.
287	If there is anything else that you think ?would be helpful for me to have, please let me know.
287	??I will be in my office (EB3015) between 5:00 and 6:00 today and Tuesday ?without scheduled meetings.
287	If you would like to stop by so that I can put a ?name and face together, please feel free to do so.
287	This is my first day back ?in the office after vacation, so I have a lot of catching up to do, but I ?would be glad to visit with you for a while.
287	--Sally ?????Nicole Palczer@ENRON COMRow/Enron Communications@Enron Communications ?Subject: PRC Meeting??Sally, ??Jim Row, my supervisor, let me know that you would be representing me at the ?PRC meeting on Wednesday.
287	I believe Jim's summary of my performance should ?offer a very good overview, but if you have any further questions for me, ?please feel free to call.??Many thanks,?Nicole??
288	This is my first day back from vacation.
288	We need to augement e:mail so that requests sent when someone is on vacation can be routed elsewhere if urgent.
288	This is request is approved.
288	Why are there so many different formats for granting systems access?
288	Some have an approval button, some don't.
288	You requested a return e:mail.
288	It seems as if each time I look at one of these it is different.
288	The status button and detail button below contain no information.
289	Today's Enron-wide Associates PRC meeting has been cancelled.
289	It was scheduled to start at 1:30 today, following the Analysts PRC.
289	Apparently, the Analysts PRC is running long.
289	Since both meetings were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as the chair, the Associates PRC has been cancelled.
289	I do not yet have a rescheduled date.
289	I will let you know when I do.
289	I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am representing so that they will informed of the cancellation.
289	Thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of your respective associate in preparation for the PRC.
290	Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.
290	Both the morning Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.
290	The Analysts PRC meeting is apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.
290	I will let you know as soon as I know a rescheduled date.
290	In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, accomplishments and performance.
290	For those that were unavailable for a meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to accomplish the same thing.
290	I also have any materials that you may have provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.
290	With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of your resume.
290	The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance specifically from January through June 2000.
290	However, it would be helpful to me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.
290	Please e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.
290	A couple of you have come by my office to meet with me.
290	I would also be happy to put a name and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in Houston.
290	My extension is 35926.
291	Thanks for including me.
291	Congratulations on Emily.
291	I know that you and she will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep will definitely be a scarce commodity.
291	Those first few weeks can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time.
291	Savor the baby stage as much as you can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.
291	Enjoy your new role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!
291	--Sally
292	I have been traveling on business and also have just returned from vacation, so I have not yet seen the proposal that you referenced.
292	I will hopefully discover it as I go through my inbox in the next few days.
293	How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?
293	Mark Taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to provide excellent service to them.
293	While I can appreciate that Diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the Calgary stuff.
293	Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen.
293	While I know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service.
293	Unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service.
293	That is a terrible internal PR issue.
293	Let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and can sustain excellent service.
293	I am copying Susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by Rob Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).
293	She responded to Rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time.
293	But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.
293	She can fill you in on the details in that situation.
293	Susan: Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?
294	I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).
294	Together we will do two things: (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.
294	We will keep you posted on both items.
294	--Sally
295	FYI - My reply to Peggy
296	Sounds like fun, and you are definitely planning ahead!
297	The following persons will be in attendance at 11:30 am in EB50M on July 21st for lunch, in addition to the two of you: Enron Employees: Shawn Cumberland - President and COO, CALME (UT BBA; UT JD) Sally Beck - VP, ENA and Global Risk Management Operations (UT BBA; UT MBA) David Mitchell - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Jennifer Martinez - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Luis Mena - Analyst (recent UT grad) Catherine Pernot (recent UT grad) Lexi Elliott - Analyst Program - UT Recruiter Christy Young - Associate Program - UT Recruiter UT Summer Associates: Steven Luong Michelle Sandner Adam Thomas UT Summer Analysts: Brenton Baxter Matt Davis Eric Efron Katherine Jett Jiyeon Kim Joanna Li Dana Lipp Amy Mohan Denise Olson Neil Rajan Angelique Woods Thanks for making the time to attend.
297	This should be a great opportunity to meet with these UT students as they near the end of their summer internships with Enron.
298	FYI
299	We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.
299	I will contact your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results.
299	Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.
299	Thanks for providing your resumes.
299	I will feel more informed during the process.
300	The Associates PRC meeting has been rescheduled for Monday, July 24th at 9:00 am.
300	I have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know about the new date.
301	I will be in the Chicago office on Monday, July 31.
301	I will be sorry to miss a lunch at Brennan's!
301	Enjoy it without me.
301	--Sally
302	I will be out of the office from Wednesday, July 26 through Friday, July 28.
302	I am taking my older daughter on a preliminary look at colleges.
302	I will have my cell phone with me -- the number is 713-417-1591.
302	My assistant, Patti Thompson, will have hotel phone numbers where I can be reached as well.
302	The following persons will be key contacts for trading operations while I am out: Natural Gas Operations Brent Price x37647 (7/31 & 8/1: Steve Jackson Power Operations Stacey White x31870 (7/31 & 8/1: Kristin Albrecht Financial Products Operations Sheila Glover x33210 Coal, Pulp & Paper, LNG Scott Earnest x31746 Weather Todd Hall x31957 DPR Mike Moscoso x35242 MPR David Maxwell x316983 I will be working in ENA's and MG's Chicago offices on Monday and Tuesday, July 31 and August 1. Patti has contact numbers for me at both offices. Key contacts in Houston are those listed above, with changes noted for Gas and Power Operations on July 31 and August 1. I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday, August 2.
303	FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this week.
303	I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.
303	I will be back in the office on Wednesday of next week.
303	Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.
303	Can you e:mail that to me?
303	If not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next Wednesday.
303	If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back in the office next week.
303	My first move will be to sit down with Jeff Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that James Scribner sent you.
303	When we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily.
303	I also think that Jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.
303	All of the advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation.
303	No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.
304	Did you mean to send that e:mail to me?
304	It was Greek to me, and I assume that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover.
304	Feels like a Monday, doesn't it?
304	--Sally
305	Can't remember at this point what the question was!
305	Thanks for following up -- I will call you if I remember.
305	--Sally
306	The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.
306	As the PRC rep, I will communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.
306	I received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on vacation.
306	I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's supervisor today.
306	It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your performance review and the ranking.
306	In your case, I would guess that Jean and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do your review.
306	--Sally
307	This was great -- and I saw myself in a number of these!!
307	It must be too long -- but that is who I am right now!
307	--Sally
308	Hope that the trip goes well.
308	It should be interesting to look at that business.
308	Keep me posted.
308	--Sally
309	To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.
309	His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on July 1.
309	Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance review being based on his work for ENA.
309	Stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at EBS.
309	During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc. It was his failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.
309	It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that category.
310	Kristin will be working for EBS at the time of this class, reporting to Barry Pearce.
310	Please contact Kristin or Barry for the appropriate RC within EBS to charge for the fee for this class.
310	If you charged ENA at the time of enrollment, please reverse that charge.
310	Thanks.
311	Requesting update access for what?
311	(can't tell from this request what it is that you want me to approve) Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?
311	(unclear) Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.
311	Is this supposed to be her title?
311	She is not a trader.
311	She is a Business Controller.
311	Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?
311	Thanks for your earlier phone message, Leola.
311	This is still a bad process and the information is not sufficient to give an approval.
312	I left you a return voice mail regarding Scott.
312	Let me know if I did not understand the role that you are trying to fill.
312	I hope that Jo likes Dr. Moore.
312	I thought that everyone in his office was so warm and friendly.
313	FYI
314	Yeah!!
314	Yes, staff meeting is 2:30 to 3:30 on Mondays in EB3014 - convenient for you at this point.
315	The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.
315	You should have received an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you this year pledges should be made on line.
315	Mark Frevert reminded everyone at today's ENA staff meeting to complete their pledges by Tuesday, August 8.
315	If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges before Tuesday.
315	Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.
315	Peggy: United Way may not apply in Canada, so ignore this if not appropriate.
316	There is a problem with this process.
316	When Sally goes to website & enters her ID & password, steve.beck comes up - not sally.beck.
316	Until this is fixed, she will be unable to process these requests.
316	Please either fix this or find another way for her to approve.
316	Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally Beck's Assistant)
317	It was great to see a friendly face!
317	Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in and say hello.
317	Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the summer of 1994?!
317	I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!
317	It is kind of fun to be up here.
317	The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so many others.
317	My family is doing great.
317	The children start school tomorrow.
317	Meagan will be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for an early look at some colleges.
317	It will be a big year for Amanda -- she starts junior high in 6th grade.
317	And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is "two and a half".
317	What a delight he continues to be!!
317	I know that Erin has worked hard.
317	I hope that she and her husband are doing well.
317	--Sally
318	I can't shed any light on the topic choice.
318	Surely you can redirect the topic.
318	Brent may have more info.
318	--Sally
319	Is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request?
319	I receive many requests daily and I have yet to any two alike.
319	Makes it tough on someone to act on these, especially when sent with a name.
319	When I click on the address included in this message, someone else's name comes up (Steve Beck).
319	I don't know who you are, what you want me to do, or if you even have the right person.
320	Can you help me on this?
320	Can you give me the name of someone who sends messages from ARSystem@ect.com?
320	To make matters even more frustrating, when I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said my e:mail was undeliverable.
320	No contact name, no phone number, and no ability to e:mail back.
320	I'm stuck!!
320	Thanks.
320	--Sally
321	To all Energy Operations employees: ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.
321	I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.
321	I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated.
321	We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.
321	Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year.
321	Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.
321	To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J.
321	Bashen Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" and breaking down any "barriers."
321	SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.
321	SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.
321	This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.
321	Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input.
321	Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant.
321	Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent.
321	Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you.
321	Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.
321	Communication is one of Enron's core values.
321	I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success.
321	Please be candid.
321	Thank you.
321	Sally
322	Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.
322	I saw Amy Leeand Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.
322	Please pass the kudos along to the rest of your team.
322	The theme was timely, the staging was great, the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.
322	(I knew the I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday. Their programs are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the children in the shelter.
323	Can you arrange with Bobbi?
323	Thanks.
324	David is doing well, too.
324	He is working contract, having quit Burlington Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible.
324	Yes, Tammy is still with us.
324	We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in Kentucky.
324	I truly am blessed.
324	--Sally
325	Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation schedule.
325	Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.
325	I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.
325	Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.
325	Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.
325	Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.
325	In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.
325	Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean.
325	I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.
325	That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.
325	What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?
325	The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.
325	I have checked Mark's travel schedule.
325	He will be in the Houston office next week, with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.
325	I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL operations.
325	I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late.
326	Do we have these numbers for Hector?
327	Thanks for copying me on this.
327	It is interesting to see your thoughts.
327	I suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.
327	I told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.
327	However, I also told him about my two dark-side fears: (1) that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need, and (2) taken to the extreme, that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle.
327	Part of the fun in operations is improving things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions.
328	That was always one of my favorites!
328	The old Parent Trap is always great too, I wish that I could be there.
328	I know that Brigeda must be excited about the slumber party.
328	When does she start school?
328	Today is day #2 for the girls --Amanda loves her classes.
328	Meagan thought that the first day "sucked".
328	I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her class selection.
328	Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!
328	I don't know what she was thinking!!
328	Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.
328	She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs.
328	I was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily I didn't have to go that far.
328	Hope that you have a good weekend!
328	Love, sally
329	The employee for whom access if requested is not an employee of Energy Operations.
329	I would assume that with his supervisor listed as Ed Baughman, that he is in a commercial origination group.
329	Someone else should be reviewing and approving this.
330	Definitely clever!
330	I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.
330	I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math skills.
330	I will definitely look into that for Meagan.
330	I wish that we could meet for lunch.
330	Keep me posted on Cara -- I have called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the beans, but no movement on that yet!
330	I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be dancing.
330	She did not make the dance for the first try-out.
330	It was jazz; not her strong suit.
330	But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs: a kick rountine and a pom routine.
330	There are two more try outs -- one more for kick and one more for pom.
330	Hopefully she will make both.
330	Each routines is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.
330	So if she makes the next two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.
330	I think that she would feel pretty good about that.
330	The last two try-outs will be next week.
330	I will keep you posted.
330	Have a great weekend.
330	Love, Sally
331	I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.
331	If you look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.
331	His e:mail to Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's group.
331	Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest.
331	I don't think that HR gets involved in this process.
331	I am not sure how I got into this loop.
331	It seems that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with Nelson.
331	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
332	Life is busy at Enron and I literally receive hundreds of e:mails every week.
332	This is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues.
332	I have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more.
332	Can you provide more details beyond your presentation?
332	What is your background and experience?
332	Can you provide information on your company?
333	FYI: Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.
333	By voice mail, I suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.
333	We are set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over lunch.
333	I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.
333	Rick Causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.
333	Any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?
333	Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.
333	--Sally
334	I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 instead of August 28.
334	I will keep you posted.
334	I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's new role.
334	I will have three persons leading the natural gas team: Steve Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.
334	I am confident that this will work well.
335	I am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for Kristin.
335	It was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.
335	Since this is her last official week with ENA, I did want to do this before she starts her new assignment.
335	--Sally
336	Thanks for the update on Dad.
336	Keep me posted on what you hear.
336	No, I didn't get the message that Cara had called.
336	With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!
336	I will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from work.
336	--Sally
337	Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.
337	I think that I saw yours.
337	Did I miss you sometime this weekend?
337	With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance.
337	I an never quite sure that I get messages that anyone calls!
337	Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during my commute tonight again.
337	Hope you had a good weekend.
337	Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and continuing the search for new clothes.
337	Our friend Mo was in town from London and had burgers with us on Saturday night.
337	--Sally
338	Can you join me at this meeting?
338	I plan to talk with Tom Gros tomorrow to let him know that you will be the liasion with CommodityLogic for Energy Operations.
338	Then I thought that we could both attend this next meeting as a transition.
338	Then it's on your calendar after that !
338	--Sally
339	As a result of the creation of the Global Markets business in the last few days, I would add the following persons to the attendee list for the ASE in Dallas: Brent Price VP Operations and CAO, Global Markets Tom Myers Director of Accounting, Global Markets Brent is in London this week, and will be on vacation the week of August 21.
339	With the demands of a new role, Brent will be best able to address the feasibility of one or both of them attending.
340	Should have sent you a copy of this...
341	Please put this on my calendar.
341	I assume that this every other week meeting will replace the weekly Friday meeting.
341	Thanks.
342	Thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program.
342	It will help to have that info in my meeting on Friday.
343	As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special projects from time to time.
343	I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.
343	I don't know about the one month timeframe.
343	I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.
343	It might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.
343	I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly without the family.
343	Can we still use Todd ?
344	Todd is completing his short-term role on the CommodityLogic team, and it is my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is completed, while also working in his role with Weather.
344	I have sent a message to Brent and I am sure that we will talk.
344	--Sally
345	I will be there!
345	--Sally
346	I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's time.
346	I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's help would be needed.
346	I think that we can review the "to do" list from James and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work, etc. As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.
346	Todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself.
346	He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself.
346	If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc. We have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.
346	If you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work.
346	I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as the contracted hired help!
346	Let me know what you think.
346	--Sally
347	Sorry that I missed you this morning.
347	I attended that last Financial Council meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert and Rick Causey.
347	Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine that we didn't get to talk today.
347	I had wanted to be prepared on how to address out current activities there.
347	So I can get an update on that when we talk tomorrow.
347	I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 tomorrow.
347	I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting.
348	I have this on my calendar.
348	At this point, I do not plan to bring anyone else to the meeting.
348	--Sally
349	Please print the attachment below for me in color.
349	Thanks.
350	I like the trip idea better than a party, personally, so I am glad that Mom and Dad seemed to like that alternative.
350	And in June, I think that the mountains sound great.
350	I have a preference for Western mountains -- big, open sky (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.
350	We were in Ashville a couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.
350	We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.
350	I am sure that there are other places in the area to research.
350	There may also be some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.
350	I think that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions.
350	In magazines, I have seen pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) that look nice.
350	I will see if I can find the names of those places.
350	Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad.
350	--Sally
351	I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.
351	My husband has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two year-old during prime homework hours.
351	Patti has some names that I have suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.
351	Very few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks have this on their calendars.
351	You may need some of the names that Patti has for you.
351	I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work for me.
351	Enron North America Corp.
352	If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the cruise, let me know.
352	My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on Wednesday night.
352	If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.
352	This is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in response from others.
352	But do let me know...
353	Same time, same place -- just not as often!
353	I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.
353	My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM meetings.
353	There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and EGM, who will attend both meetings.
353	Today was the ENA Management Team meeting.
353	Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM management team.
353	I will look forward to staying current with each one of you and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global Markets.
353	I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the calendar going forward.
353	Although this new structure changes the direct line reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the professional development of each of you.
353	I hope that we can schedule time together on an as needed basis.
354	This was sent for my approval.
354	The manager listed below does not work in Energy Operations.
354	This should be sent to someone else for approval.
355	Thanks for the follow up.
355	Please move forward with this offer with the sign on payment.
355	Thanks.
355	Enron North America Corp.
356	Please print the attachment for me in color ( I have to put that burnt orange on my bulletin board), put this event on my calendar and research flight information for me.
356	I would fly over on the afternoon of the 7th and back on the morning of the 8th.
356	Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel reservations, or if we should make those.
356	Thanks.
357	Was Lisa a recent hire that Susan Harrison brought in?
357	I don't immediately recognize her name, but wonder if that's who this is.
357	Also, I left you a message about Bob Klein's resignation, as I learned from Jeff Sorenson.
357	I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you.
357	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
358	I met with Karen Marshall today.
358	She is in the Community Relations group and is organizing the dinner on September 7th.
358	I suggested that she add to the invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this summer).
358	I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know people at the school.
358	I will keep you posted.
358	--Sally
359	Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.
359	Beverly Scott, with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.
359	She offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.
359	I was planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that I decided to take her up on it.
359	She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a list of names and numbers).
359	I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list.
359	I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I know that she is working on it.
359	Just a little more slowly than I would like!
359	I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today and make calls.
359	Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.
359	Her number at work is 281-444-0751.
360	I will be at the meeting on the 24th.
361	Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.
361	It does not work.
361	I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.
361	I am confused about why we are using a system that does not work.
361	I understand that there are bugs in the system.
361	Was the system tested before being put into production?
361	I tried to reach you by phone.
361	You were unavailable and I could not leave a voice mail because that was full.
361	I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally okayed the access for Bob Hall.
361	Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system is not functioning.
361	You might at least put a contact name and number on these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system is fixed.
361	My number is 35926.
361	I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and timing.
362	Glad you got some rain.
362	We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.
362	No water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas in and around Houston.
362	I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and have lunch for your birthday.
362	I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.
362	Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.
362	David and I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on the way over!
363	On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars.
363	On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project.
363	Last night, the magazine made it into my hands around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.
363	What a nice article!
363	I smiled while reading it.
363	How nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print.
363	Congratulations.
363	I hope that you have plenty of copies for your mom and dad.
363	--Sally
364	I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday.
364	I will look forward to seeing you there.
364	Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?
364	I will be there.
364	I did let Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about mid afternoon on Thursday.
364	Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the teachers.
364	With this being Amanda's first year in junior high, it is important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so that I can best support her in school.
364	Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team will be there for the duration.
364	I look forward to seeing you there, too!
364	--Sally
365	Do you know who this is?
365	I don't recognize the manager's name.
365	Thanks.
366	Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in Japan.
366	I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought processes.
366	I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.
366	While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option.
366	I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.
366	After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings.
366	That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday.
366	I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have.
366	I should have apologized in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston.
366	Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he is under!).
366	I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person sometime in the not too distant future.
366	Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business controllers for all commodities and offices.
366	I am working on securing a location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential dates.
366	More details to come on that in the next day or so.
366	I know that is a long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join us.
367	The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice Presidents has been rescheduled several times.
367	Currently, this meeting is set for September 11 and 12.
367	Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.
367	Assuming that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule your reviews sometime after September 12.
367	(Bob, I will assume that your review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process along with Peggy and Brent.) On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for Vice President level and above.
367	You should all receive invitations to this event.
367	In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.
367	I do not know the location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your calendars: November 15-17.
367	Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these.
368	In cleaning up e:mails, I can across this one from Sheila.
368	Is this one of the corrections that was made to the June information?
368	Any update on July?
368	Thanks.
369	FYI - I responded to Sharron.
370	RSVP: Yes, I will attend.
370	I will arrive in San Antonio in time for the dinner on Tuesday evening.
370	Count me out for golf on Wednesday - I don't think they would want me to play!
370	Breakout Sessions: SAP Reporting Issues Analyst/Associates Program (I will be glad to participate in any of the sessions, if there are needs to move anyone around) Top 4 Objectives for Accounting Group: Streamline close process (from a Non-Accountant!!) Implement data warehouse for flexible reporting Increase visible participation in Analyst and Associate recruiting and rotations Asssure efficient service from COE (or its replacement), providing timely, creative solutions and an extremely high degree of excellence Dietary/Special Needs: Something chocolate for dessert!!!
371	No manager is listed below on this request and I don't know the employee.
371	The manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these.
371	Without that, I can't possibly tell what group this person is working in and whether or not it makes sense to grant the system access.
371	Please return this to me for my approval when complete.
372	Not too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.
372	It's kind of hard to fly to Bermuda from Texas.
372	Easy from New York, but not that much traffic between Houston/Austin and there.
372	A few years ago when we went with David's family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental through their group rate department.
372	That works when you travel with a group of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.
372	I think that our round trip from Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.
372	Hopefully we could arrange something like that.
372	If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that could be tough.
372	Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or three and rank them?
372	Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, etc. to see what would be most feasible.
372	Or should we research a few places and present those choices for them to consider?
372	What do you think?
372	Seems like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.
372	And what do you and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?
372	Our kids will get out of school on Friday, May 25.
372	The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.
372	We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit that I am in. Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early February.
372	I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for everyone.
373	It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.
373	After you have received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested.
373	I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.
373	I will reserve judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses.
374	Let's let her float in that vision for a while...
375	Wow - thanks for copying me on these.
375	--Sally
376	I will be at the presentation.
376	I can not make a faculty lunch that day -- it's my mother's birthday and she lives in Austin, so I have already committed to lunch with her.
376	Just let me know the details on how soon you would like for me to arrive at the Alumni Center, and if there is anything else that I can do.
376	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
377	If needed in reviewing the V@R calculations, the following persons have been identified as contacts for questions over the weekend: Natural Gas Jeff Gossett Home: 281-358-7546 (Kingwood # - may be long distance) Power Jenny Latham Home: 713-977-4904 Cell: 713-443-5367 Global Products Scott Earnest Home: 713-436-1102 Cell: 713-825-5470 Other Mike Moscoso Cell: 713-825-0543 Sally Beck Home: 281-370-8568
378	I can't make 10:00 on September 7th.
378	I have a business review meeting scheduled with Jeff Skilling at that time.
378	FYI: Bob Klein has resigned from the company effective August 31.
378	Let me know what I miss in the meeting.
378	Thanks.
378	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
379	I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.
379	I just wanted you to know that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.
379	I have asked Lexi to update me on the meeting.
379	--Sally
380	Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?
380	It might be helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that you are available for any questions.
380	Nothing may come up, but I think that Tom would feel better with this gesture.
380	Probably wouldn't hurt to log the same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.
380	That will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on this project.
380	Do you have contact information for Brenda?
380	If not, I would get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.
380	She is making the rounds with Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase.
380	Thanks.
380	--Sally
381	I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on Friday evening.
381	Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.
381	His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.
381	Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.
381	Randy has a four year-old daughter.
381	Several of us will be attending the funeral today.
381	Over the past several weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic association.
381	Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded.
382	Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.
382	These days with Mom and Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.
382	That way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to come up.
382	Hopefully, never needed!
382	Have a great time in New York later this week.
382	I sent you a newspaper article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave.
383	I think that we sent this to the wrong e:mail address at first...
384	I'm trying again!
385	Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine: Friday, September 15 7:00 pm Saturday, October 14 7:00 pm Friday, October 20 7:00 pm (homecoming) There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if alternates are needed.
385	Nothing definitive on that, of course.
385	She did get put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.
385	We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if it would work around one of these games.
385	I have also given this schedule to Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.
385	I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.
385	Patti has sent you a copy of my itinerary.
386	I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.
386	I am sure that both ot you know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources for ERMS support.
386	Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.
386	And with the assumption that Sitara will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned as one of our key, strategic systems.
386	There is much to do to "catch up", if you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the Sitara development stage.
386	And our business continues to grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going basis.
386	I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS as soon as possible.
386	We need to understand how day-to-day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled.
386	I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.
387	Please set up a meeting with Steve and Beth as soon as we can.
387	I believe that Beth is out sick at the present.
388	I was able to get into the application this time.
388	I could see the request for Shona on the screen and I clicked "Approval".
388	The status did not change from pending and there was no pop up on the screen that indicated that the request was processed.
388	So I do not know if this worked.
389	Please print all attachments for me.
389	Thanks.
390	October 20th sounds great -- we will reserve the guest room for you!
391	Thanks for the resume.
391	I have been out of town the last several business days, so I am just now catching up on e:mails.
391	David told me that he ran into you at lunch.
391	Small world...
391	How are things going for you?
391	I hope that this was a good move for you.
391	--Sally
392	I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the night before.
392	I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.
392	It is unlikely that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be difficult to reschedule.
392	If your responses from participants for the Friday session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.
392	I have been out of the office on business for the last several days (recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full schedule.
392	I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond by noon today as you had asked.
392	--Sally
393	I already have a meeting scheduled for Friday from 2:00 to 2:30.
393	I will join you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not last a full 30 minutes.
393	In case I can not make the meeting, I have printed the attachment.
393	Thanks.
394	The week of September 11 is not a great week for me.
394	I am out of the officfrom Tuesday at noon through Friday afternoon, so my Monday and Tuesday morning are already booked!
394	I checked to see if there was anything that Icould bump off the schedule for Monday, but I am doing several performancereviews and have Richard Sage here from London to go over several things.
394	The next week, I am at a Communications training session on Monday, September 18 and then will be in a V@R class on Thursday and Friday, September 21 and22.
394	Let's try for Tuesday or Wednesday that week, the 19th or 20th.
394	I havPatti checking on some travel details for me.
394	I have to make a presentatiofor recruiting in Austin on Wednesday late afternoon or evening.
394	Let me know what works for you.
394	--Sally
395	Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the call center that supports EnronOnline.
395	There is also a call center for Clickpaper.com.
395	Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that effort as well.
395	I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on their efforts and yours.
395	Welcome to Enron.
395	It was nice to meet you last week.
395	--Sally
396	It was good to see you last week, too.
396	That was a big group, and there were many people that I just passed in the halls!
396	I would love to participate, but I will be out of town on September 14.
396	Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Septemer 13-15 in San Antonio.
396	Thanks for thinking of me.
396	--Sally
397	The 13th won't work for me, unfortunately.
397	Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).
397	If you were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.
397	The only problem with that is that the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.
397	I don't know that the VP portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.
397	We have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.
397	I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.
397	Seems like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!
397	--Sally
398	Thanks for you message.
398	I am glad to know that you like what you see in the office to date.
398	I am planning a trip to Chicago soon, so I will look forward to seeing you there.
399	Please set up a 30 minute meeting for me with Dave.
399	Thanks.
400	Does this make sense to you?
400	Seems like they may have the wrong person.
400	Can you follow up?
400	Thanks.
401	We will need this, so I am sending it to you as well.
401	--sally

403	I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your e:mail today.
403	I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be getting back to you.
403	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.
404	This came in while I was in Austin last week, so I am just reading it today.
404	Any thoughts on this one?
404	--Sally
405	Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon on OPM.
405	The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.
405	And your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, organized, prepared and confident.
405	It was an effective and informative presentation to the group.
405	Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project.
406	Who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them?
407	Yes, Mary Solmonson from Energy Operations has volunteered to host a student in the Job Shadowing program.
407	Mary may have one of her directors host the student.
407	Please use Mary Solmonson as the primary contact for this program.
407	Her extension is 36079.
407	Thanks.
408	I am not aware of an Enron-wide issue, but it would seem strange that two such instances occurred within your group.
408	You may want to contact someone in security to give them the details so that they can investigate.
409	Please print and start a file for me for year-end PRC 2000.
409	Yikes!!
409	Thanks.
410	I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.
410	I will leave the offsite meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common needs around risk systems.
410	I will be in the office the afternoon of September 15.
410	Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I can be reached.
410	Key contacts while I am out are listed below: Natural Gas Operations Steve Jackson x37070 Bob Hall x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962 Power Operations Stacey White x31870 Leslie Reeves x37962 DPR Mike Moscoso x35242 MPR David Maxwell x36983
411	I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.
411	This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.
411	It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.
411	I learned recently that Yvonne has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and above.
411	Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis.
411	I met with Todd recently.
411	He has had wonderful experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project.
411	Please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from Todd.
411	The quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that I will receive from Todd.
411	I think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project!
411	Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of Energy Operations.
411	Since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.
411	You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.
411	Sally
412	I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?
412	Since he was the top graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.
412	I know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.
412	I do know that Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.
412	I just wanted you to take a look at this.
412	Thanks.
413	This approval request is incomplete - it does not include the name of this employee's manager.
413	I do not know the employee, and without the name of the manager I can't possibly approve this.
413	Please get someone to complete this request.
414	Too late with your spreadsheet.
414	The instructions that we got from Donna were that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then on to Causey for his review.
414	Considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by Thursday at noon.
414	I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.
414	I asked Patti to make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first.
414	I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training class.
414	We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.
414	I believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will pass the resumes along to you.
414	Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.
414	Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well.
414	I would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review.
414	The plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical, and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.
414	If you are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.
414	If someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.
414	Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not Analysts interviews.
414	Please give us organized information to react to, not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.
414	All of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and organizational work.
414	I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being critical.
414	I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.
414	Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated
415	I will take a look at my calendar and let you know when I can come north.
415	I am heading to the airport in 5 minutes for a flight to Austin to make a presentation at UT tonight, capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel for me.
415	I will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the next few weeks and I will let you know.
415	I sat by Sheila Knudsen at the ENA staff meeting on Friday afternoon last week, and asked her if we should now schedule VP reviews.
415	The VP PRC meeting (much rescheduled) did take place on September 11 and 12.
415	Sheila said that as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the PRC, and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand.
415	I will check with HR this week so see if all is finalized, so that we can schedule the review.
415	I will keep you posted.
416	This employee and his/her manager, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me.
416	This approval should be sent to someone else.
417	Diana, Here's info you requested.
417	Per our conversation earlier, please try to arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for Sally & me both.
417	Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.
417	If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know what I mean.
417	Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.
417	Please have person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.
417	She will be in training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is available.
417	Password: balc33balc Lotus password: balc33balc H:\ drive mapping: "nahou-uv3" I submitted SRRS for "in sync" two or three weeks ago.
417	Let me know if you need anything else.
417	Patti Thompson x39106
418	I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.
418	That is on my calendar for Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.
418	I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.
418	To date, I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes.
418	I will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well.
418	With the recent reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.
418	After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format.
418	In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards.
418	We are in the phase of determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations against the operating standards.
418	As we get this to a first draft stage, I will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.
418	--Sally
419	I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand the issue.
419	Did Willie not do his job?
419	Are there problems with how SAP works?
419	Are both of these an issue?
419	Please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with SAP and netting.
419	Thanks.
419	--Sally
420	I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had anticipated in SAP.
420	I also know that there are several things where we have to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.
420	We also have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a mismatch of that timing with our business processes.
420	There was a concerted effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve issues.
420	They met with my direct reports.
420	However, we have to reconvene as we ran out of time to cover all issues!
420	I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system.
420	I will get back with you as I know more details and as I can share with you our list of first "hits" for SAP fixes or enhancements.
420	Thanks for sharing this with me.
420	--Sally
421	Yes, he is working on the short list.
421	I do have to say, however, that I have not had questions from him on any of those names.
421	I will leave him a voice mail message for an update.
422	Please put this on my calendar.
422	I don't know if I will make it there, but I would like for it to be on my calendar.
422	Thanks.
423	It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.
423	As always, I appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
423	I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.
423	You have done a great job in changing and promoting the program.
423	I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns ASAP.
423	I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of the issue.
423	I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a change in our strategy!
423	If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.
423	We will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold.
423	On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments.
423	He has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts, caps, etc. Do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?
423	Let me know -- we can probably place a few orders through you!
424	Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio November 15-17.
424	Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save the date than to provide any detail at this point).
424	If you have not received your invitation, please let me know.
425	Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.
425	With the ages of the kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.
425	The kids love our home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up.
425	(I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party!) We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season.
425	However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date.
425	That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.
425	Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games.
425	Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs.
425	So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan.
425	We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.
425	Do you have a list of what is available for those schools?
426	Thanks for your list.
426	I have talked with Brent and of the three names that you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.
426	I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they should be included.
426	While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are depending on to stress and enforce controls.
426	Heidi particularly does have active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day basis.
426	And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their locations - weather, coal, etc. I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting to him when I saw him in San Antonio.
426	He can certainly respectfully decline!
427	This employee, and his supervisor, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me.
427	Someone else should be approving this requested access.
428	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.
428	On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.
428	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?
428	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?
428	With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.
428	With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.
428	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.
428	I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.
428	Finally, a question regarding timing.
428	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.
428	I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.
428	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.
428	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
428	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.
428	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.
428	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.
428	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?
428	Sorry that this response looks so long.
428	I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.
428	Thanks for sharing this with me.
428	Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some.
428	--Sally
429	Late Jan sounds great.
429	Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion.
429	I believe that these are three weekends in a row, January 6, 13 and 20th.
429	So the last weekend in January would work well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).
429	Does that work for you?
429	And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?
429	Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!!
430	Fernley: I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.
430	In fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.
430	The global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc. I would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point.
430	However, I thought that I would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts.
431	Would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to Shawn?
431	Thanks.
432	FYI - yes, my response was lengthy!
433	FYI
434	This is fine.
434	--Sally
435	I can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved.
435	Since Gregory's address looks as if he is at Corp., just let me know who he is and what I am being asked to approve.
435	Please reply with history attached.
435	Thanks.
435	--Sally
436	This request is approved.
436	Your request forms that you send still don't provide enough information in layman's terms so that I know what you are asking to be approved.
436	Are we working on this?
437	I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the need for operating standards.
437	If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.
437	If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, then that would be great.
437	It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.
437	--Sally
438	Hope are things in London?
438	I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.
438	We have been making the Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.
438	I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at the end of October/beginning of November.
438	She will be interviewing students at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.
438	They will be staying with us at our house.
438	It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one another!
438	She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.
438	By the way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here she will be about six months pregnant.
438	I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in Houston at that time.
438	It would be fun for all of us to get together.
438	I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, who was on his first day here.
438	We could also schedule a First City reunion if you could be here.
438	If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour.
438	I may need to head to London in October or November.
438	I will let you know if my travel plans develop.
438	I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain climbing!!!!!!!
438	How was it?
438	I will be anxious to hear.
438	--Sally
439	Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group?
440	Thanks for sending the dates in writing.
440	We already have this on our home calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.
440	I did confirm that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.
440	The weather should be great here then.
440	I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc. I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may need to be in Houston at that time.
440	I will let you know what I hear from her.
441	This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations.
441	The language regarding Jeff's role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.
441	It wasn't clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.
441	Since you said that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.
441	There should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements.
441	This memo as sent will create that confusion.
441	Thanks.
442	Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.
442	I suppose that if she wants others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake that we can!
442	(Do you think that we will be invited?) That really sounds ugly, and I don't mean it to.
442	I think that your idea was a great one, but if she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.
442	Let me know when the deliberation process is completed!
442	--Sally
443	4 counterparties for a total of $10.2MM makes me think that each one must be pretty large.
443	I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is in each case.
443	Leslie: I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question that Dave may ask.
444	FYI
445	I will be recruiting at Wellsley College for the Analyst Program on Thursday, September 28.
445	I will fly back from Boston on Friday, September 29 and I should be back in the office between 11:30 and 12:00.
445	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.
445	While I am out of the office, the following persons will serve as key contacts: Gas Operations Bob Hall x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962 Steve Jackson x37070 Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962 DPR Mike Moscoso x35242 MPR David Maxwell x36983
446	Peggy, is the EOL bridge functionality working for you in Calgary?
446	Jeff Gossett was in a meeting with me on Monday this week discussing systems issues.
446	Beth Perlman mentioned that the EOL bridging had been completed, but Jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly.
446	You or someone on your team may want to call Jeff to understand the issues that he was having to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in Calgary.
446	Thanks.
447	Attached is a memo that I have sent to Mike Jordan regarding the Operations Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.
447	I want to send the official invitation early next week.
447	I have conferred with Mike on attendees from EEL.
447	Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is finalized.
447	Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.
447	Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.
447	If you can come, I would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.
447	Just let me know.
447	Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his participation.
447	I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.
447	Hope you have a great weekend.
447	--Sally
448	While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.
448	In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns.
448	I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.
448	When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.
448	It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.
448	I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.
448	When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.
448	Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.
448	They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.
448	I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.
448	And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.
448	While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.
448	As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.
448	I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.
448	I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.
448	I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.
448	In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.
448	I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you.
448	Please let me know how this can be resolved.
448	With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.
448	I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around.
449	FYI...I will keep you posted.
450	It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation from Enron.
450	Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another company in the industry.
450	I know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.
450	His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as will his leadership on the gas team.
450	Although Steve's official last day with the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.
450	He will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.
450	Patti has his home number if you need that.
450	We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place.
450	Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group, reporting to me.
450	Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for North America.
450	Please join me in congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities.
451	Thanks for looking into this for me.
451	Enron North America Corp.
452	Good input on those leather pants.
452	I can just picture her shopping.
452	We will look forward to seeing you for lunch on Saturday.
452	The weather looks as if it should be good for the game that night.
452	See you soon!
453	Please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list.
453	Thanks.
454	I always compile a contact list for Energy Operations during the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years).
454	Just let me know who appropriate contacts will be, especially for the DPR and MPR, during the dates that you are out.
454	Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas!
454	--Sally
455	I am so glad that you will be able to attend.
455	I will have a fully developed draft agenda available within the next couple of days.
455	It may help to know that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.
455	We hope to have Mark Frevert join us that night to informally address the group.
455	Sunday night will be low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to Houston.
455	On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.
455	I do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings in the Houston office on Wednesday.
455	If that is the case, I will also arrange a dinner for Tuesday night.
455	Hope that this helps!
456	Hector: The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, with the exception of Will Kelly.
456	If you remember, these are the risk employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter of resignation.
456	Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer.
456	We don't want this to happen.
456	Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense.
456	Please call me tomorrow and let's talk about how we can jump start this.
456	Thanks.
456	--Sally
457	It was a pleasure to meet you and to talk with someone who knows ERCOT, PJM, etc.!
457	Thanks for taking the time on both Wednesday and Thursday to visit with us.
457	You should be hearing from Lexi soon regarding our Super Saturday event.
458	Thanks for the note, and thanks, too, for taking time on both days to talk with us.
458	You should hear from Lexi soon regarding the Super Saturday event.
459	Thanks for asking me.
459	I enjoyed the opportunity to meet your team and to talk with them.
460	Thanks for forwarding this contact list.
460	You should add my contact information to the list as well and redistribute to the team.
460	Thanks.

461	Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers.
461	However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.
461	The remainder are senior specialists.
461	Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail.
461	We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these players away.
461	Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our competitor, which will require that he have good people.
461	He will be moving to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.
461	He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high.
461	Enron would not want to lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.
462	Attached is your actual form.
462	I did not have a totally blank one to forward, as I have actually done work on all evals on my disk.
462	So I am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template.
462	Hope this works!
463	I did find one that I have not used.
463	You will just need to change the information at the top of the page.
464	I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday recruiting as well.
464	James and I have not had a chance to talk following your conversations.
464	Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.
464	I have some tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail.
465	I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her resume.
465	Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in November.
465	I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, and was impressed with her.
465	She has followed up with phone calls and this e:mail.
465	I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company.
465	Her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies.
465	--Sally
466	I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.
466	I would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town.
466	I have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.
466	Part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and from around the world.
466	If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will probably be enhanced.
466	This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.
466	I hate the Sunday thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.
466	Please let Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate.
467	11th grade ticktocker meeting details: Location: Home of Kristen and Nancy Dipaulo (check my spelling on this one!)

467	--Sally
468	If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am on Friday?
468	That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews (defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - the signed review).
468	The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.
468	Although many employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time.
468	Thanks.
468	Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is the case we may be alright without the review.
468	But getting a second copy from Clara would probably be the best bet.
468	Thanks.
469	Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got at noon today.
469	Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed ever since.
469	Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me earlier.
469	However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could have called until now.
469	And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail is much better.
469	I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.
469	All of our mid-year reviews must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.
469	Big push, after an over percentage completion rate of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.
469	Some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).
469	I wrote three last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three reviews this morning.
469	I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at 100%.
469	I will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car.
469	If I miss you then, it will be late afternoon Houston time before I could call you.
469	Next week shapes up to be MUCH better.
469	I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.
469	Would love to have to over here and involved in operations.
469	So I will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday.
470	Glad you could make it yesterday.
470	I don't play (at least not in front of others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.
470	I will keep your number handy!
470	Enron Capital Management
471	I have this on my calendar and I will be there.
471	Thanks.
471	--Sally
472	As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from Enron.
472	What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super Saturday?
473	Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?
473	As you are probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the analyst program.
473	Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.
473	We will be on campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).
473	Let me know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU.
473	Hope that all is going well in Chicago.
473	--Sally
474	Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.
474	If possible, I would love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.
474	The first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.
474	I could easily be in Norman for a 9:00 am interview.
474	I can also stay for interviews on October 31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or treating with a 2 year old).
474	I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.
474	I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time.
474	I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office.
474	I will let you know what I hear back from him.
474	Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management overview.
474	Keep me posted on details.
474	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
475	See names below for your IT contacts tonight - one on 32 and one on 31.
475	Do you know these folks?
475	They should be visibly on your floors.
475	Let me know if that doesn't happen.
475	--Sally
476	Thanks.
476	I have shared these with Jeff Gossett (gas risk lead) and Scott Earnest (products risk lead).
476	I will be curious to hear about the plan that your DBA's have devised today.
476	Thanks for you help and attention to these problems.
477	Irfan was one of the UT students, not OU.
477	Just wanted to make sure that we have him on the right list.
477	Enron North America Corp.
478	I could go to Austin the night of Wednesday, October 25 for dinner with students if you need me.
478	Let me know.
478	Enron North America Corp.
479	I will be there on the 25th.
479	Thanks.
479	--Sally Brenda Flores-Cuellar@ENRON
480	Thanks for passing along the announcement.
480	You are right, the grapevine news did precede this more formal annoucement!
480	Sounds as if this will be a fun position for you.
480	Thanks for all of the great work that you have done on behalf of mid and back office operations.
480	Your help in Helsinki earlier this year was especially wonderful.
480	I will call you when I next come to London and will hope that you will have time for lunch or dinner to catch up.
480	--Sally
481	FYI - Let's discuss
482	I am open from 3:00 to 4:00 on Thursday - have to meet with Enron's legal counsel from Sydney at 4:00, followed by a 4:30 meeting with Delainey on a proposed asset sale.
482	I have rescheduled my meeting with the Sydney guy several times this week, and I think this may be my last shot of meeting with him during this trip.
482	Is an hour sufficient?
482	--Sally
483	Thanks for the names and numbers.
483	I have just called and talked with Jonathan Beck and Jenia Nikolova; have left voice mail messages of congratulations for Jeremy Fitzpatrick, Matthew Olney, David Scott, Corrinn Sutton, and Thomas Underwood; and left a message with a roommate for Ryan White.
483	I did not get an answer of any kind when I tried Thomas Lowell's number.
483	He is the only one that I have not contacted at this point.
483	I will try his number again before I leave tonight.
483	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
484	I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin on Wednesday, October 25.
484	That date does not work for me now.
484	I need to attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just set up today.
484	As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.
484	This is in addition to my role within ENA.
484	As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team for their team building next Wednesday.
484	Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next week.
484	If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another night that week.
484	--Sally
485	Thanks -- 3:00 pm Thursday sounds great.
485	On 21 I assume?
485	I will see you there.
486	Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.
486	As speakers were confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those speakers.
486	Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.
486	We have arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.
486	This can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.
486	The morning on Monday will set the stage: why we have gathered, endorsement of our efforts (Causey).
486	Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short "state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and EEL).
486	Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.
486	Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact.
486	Each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon.
486	Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and lessons learned.
486	Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project.
486	Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers: a website tailored for the group.
486	We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.
486	Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace.
486	Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.
486	Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.
486	He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.
486	He will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions.
486	The rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within Enron.
486	Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.
486	Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.
486	After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).
486	Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.
486	The only details still in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's attendance.
487	FYI re: schedule
488	FYI - would love to have your comments or suggestions
489	As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is attached at the end of my memo to Mike.
489	The memo will walk you through the agenda.
489	Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.
489	Again, I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so many others from the London office will be in attendance.
489	--Sally
490	Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller Forum.
490	There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.
490	All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron entities: Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.
490	Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business-maybe!).
490	Attached for your reference is the agenda.
490	There may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.
490	You are scheduled to address the group as follows: Date: Monday, October 23, 2000 Time: 3:30 pm Place: The Warwick Hotel The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 5701 Main Street I have noted that your topic will be assessing, measuring and managing market risk.
490	Any references that you could make to the importance of information flow between RAC and operations would be great to cover.
490	Feel free to offer up a challenge to the group.
490	I hope that you will be able to join us for the tour of Enron Field and for dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace on Monday evening.
490	The tour is at 6:00 and dinner is at 7:00.
491	FYI - my details to Philippe
492	My details to Ted ...
493	My details to Rick and Sharron...
494	My details to Jeff and Sherri
495	My details to Bill Bradford...
496	Attached - still not quite final - waiting for confirmation from Tom Gros and Philippe Bibi.
496	Can we add an Enron logo to the top of the first page?
496	Thanks.
496	I also sent this version to Mike Jordan, Fernley Dyson and Shona for their input.
496	Can you e:mail a copy to Tom Hopwood?
496	Thanks.
497	I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.
497	My dad is experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.
497	I will be going to the doctor's appointment with my dad.
497	Depending upon waiting room time, I may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the findings from the recent internal audit projects.
497	I have asked Shona Wilson to attend in my place.
497	Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this is a difficult meeting to schedule.
497	I will get an update from Shona when I get back to the office.
498	FYI - handled
499	I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs for Energy Operations in ENA.
499	Frank is working on a contract basis at this time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.
499	I have given Sheila my feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank than I have had.
499	Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with Frank.
499	Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.
499	Thanks for taking the time to do this.
500	I would like to formulate the breakout groups prior to the forum.
500	I would like your input on likely persons to put together in these breakout sessions.
500	Let's talk tomorrow.
501	I hope that you have fun (are marathon and fun mutally exclusive terms?!).
501	We will see you on Monday.
501	--Sally
502	Thanks for the note.
502	I remembered that you will be coming in from London.
502	Hope the trip is uneventful.
502	Sunday evening will not be lengthy, as I am sure that you will be tired.
503	We can't wait to see the three of you.
503	Tammy and Tyler will be at home on Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.
503	Meagan has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.
503	Mo will be in Houston while you are here.
503	If it still works with your plans, I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.
503	The football game is that evening at 7:00.
503	I had also thought about arranging a lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's?) either for us with Mo, or even to expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.
503	Mark Wilson, James Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.
503	We could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a reunion.
503	Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.
503	Our phone numbers are: Home 281-370-8568 Sally's Office 713-853-5926 David's Cell: 713-299-1436 Sally's Cell: 713-417-1591
504	Cary, thanks for the response.
504	We will keep your name on the list and will contact you for any spring events.
504	--Sally
505	You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that without your having to tell me.
505	I cherish having sisters and love you very much too.
505	(Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but don't tell Cara I said that!)
506	Thanks for the call.
506	Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM.
506	(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both direct reports of mine.) Brenda is out of the country through the end of this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.
506	If there is a need to address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road until Brenda returns.
506	Let me know.
506	I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to go live in London within 5 days.
506	I am trying to find out if that is true.
506	If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.
506	We had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.
506	Not ideal.
506	I hope that history has not repeated itself.
506	Let me know if you have heard anything on this.
507	Thanks for your note.
507	I was great to meet you - I am glad that you could take the time out of the office to make the trip to Houston.
507	I will look forward to seeing you when I am next in London.
507	--Sally
508	I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.
508	As far as the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest (global products).
508	They can give you the best estimate on timing.
508	I am copying them on this memo.
508	When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).
508	Please send me a copy as well.
508	This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation times will be very much appreciated.
508	I understand that not only will this provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet macros.
509	The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San Antonio.
509	It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling on Wednesday afternoon.
509	I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that week, so those days work well for me for your visit.
509	I just wanted you to know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that you might want to have in Houston that week.
509	Let me know.
509	I will look forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.
509	We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.
509	Have a great weekend.
509	--Sally
510	Please use my office for the interviews on November 4th.
510	My office is EB3389.
510	If you need additional offices, you could contact several of my direct reports who have offices: Brent Price, Brenda Herod, Bob Hall, Mary Solmonson and James Scribner.
510	--Sally
511	I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not even realize that the time had passed.
511	Construction on my route in to work is to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to busts.
511	I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.
511	Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.
511	It was great to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.
511	Your support for the interaction between offices is so valuable.
511	Thanks again for all of your efforts.
511	--Sally
512	Please print this for me in color ASAP.
512	I need to review it today and get back to Louise.
512	Thanks.
513	I did not see an attachment to this memo from MP.
513	Enron North America Corp.
514	Lexi: In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with this disposition: Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the career center?) and no to Ryan.
514	I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with Enron North America Corp.
515	I have attended three ASE's and would be happy to visit with you about my opinions.
515	I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting.
515	--Sally
516	I told Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at 9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.
516	Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday this week?
516	Thanks.
516	--Sally
517	Thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.
517	Hopefully, this will be fruitful for everyone.
517	And maybe unnecessary at some point in time!
517	Thanks.
517	-Sally
518	I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote.
518	Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow.
518	For those employees who typically work later hours, please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office.
518	Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count.
518	It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.
518	Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome.
519	Great - we will look forward to seeing you on the 13th and 14th.
519	I will work on an agenda this week, and will send you something later in the week.
519	--Sally
520	Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included.
520	This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft memo).
520	Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions.
521	Enjoy the trip.
521	Two of our most fun vacations were at South Seas Planatation on Captiva Island.
521	Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.
521	It will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.
521	Yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table.
521	Our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl.
521	If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim.
521	It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.
521	We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.
521	As the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.
521	I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them.
521	Yes, good news on Dad.
521	I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.
521	It is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.
521	It is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.
521	I think that he dodged a bullet on this one.
521	We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.
521	No big plans yet.
521	I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.
521	I have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November birthdays that evening.
521	Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).
521	I will have the whole week off from work.
521	The kids are off starting on Wednesday.
521	It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.
521	If you can stay, we could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!!
522	It's late and I am out of paper.
522	Please print message and attachment for me for Tuesday morning.
522	Thanks.
523	I am so sorry about the fire.
523	That must be awful -- but I am so glad that no one was hurt.
523	I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.
523	Please let me know if there is anything that I can do.
523	Do you need me to get you anything over here and ship it to London?
523	I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next week.
523	I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.
523	My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.
523	My nanny will be on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.
523	I may do some work early in the week, but likely from home.
523	The week after Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview for the analyst program.
523	I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).
523	Assuming that I can get a flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston Wednesday through Friday that week.
523	Would that work?
523	Sorry I am out so much in the next few weeks.
523	Just let me know.
523	--Sally
524	This will work well, assuming Steve and Chris are available.
524	Hopefully, Lexi will have their resumes for you tomorrow.
524	Thanks for your help.
524	I will be in touch on details.
525	Thanks for your help.
525	This should work well, assuming Chris and Steve are available.
525	Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you tomorrow.
525	I will be in touch on details.
526	Thanks for your help.
526	I will be in touch tomorrow on details.
526	Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you.
526	If not, let me know, and some of us who interviewed on campus may have them still.
526	--sally
527	Thanks for making this time change.
528	I do know Jana.
528	She has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program.
528	She has not been the strongest player.
528	Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements).
528	And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it.
528	She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.
528	Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role.
528	I will let you know what he thinks.
528	It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her.
528	If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree.
528	Very sweet, pleasant to work with and personable.
528	I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or I may have him leave you a message.
529	Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris Hoyle.
529	If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about it.
529	I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team.
529	_Sally
530	I couldn't agree with you more.
530	Mike missed the point of our phone call this week.
530	It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!
530	The point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed.
530	And how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for US operations that Mike's response was a deferral to Marcelo.
530	I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow.
530	This is one of the things that we will discuss.
530	--Sally
531	Good memo.
531	I will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys.
531	--Sally
532	I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX RRCommission earlier this year.
532	I suspect this is a result of that.
532	Brenda Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.
532	If she hasn't already told you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on that.
532	--Sally
533	I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would forward it to you.
533	Does it make sense?
533	$8MM in equipment charges for us???????
533	Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?
533	Can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" line?
533	What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.
533	Thanks.
533	--Sally
534	You have the right Sally Beck.
534	I grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) with Jim and the whole family.
534	Plus your mom and I used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.
534	I had heard through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.
534	I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.
534	Call my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get together.
534	Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.
534	I look forward to seeing you.
534	By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing Beck.
534	--Sally
535	Thanks for your comments on the standards.
535	Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.
535	Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year.
535	That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global standards.
535	Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services.
535	Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies.
535	Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you.
535	We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.
535	Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports.
535	It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports.
535	Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities.
535	My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions.
535	It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.
535	For instance, small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.
535	These were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).
535	If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.
535	By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate attention to correct them.
535	The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller.
535	I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood.
535	The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards.
535	The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these.
536	Thanks for the note.
536	I will definitely look for you in San Antonio.
536	I would love to hear about your new role.
536	We miss seeing you in ENA.
536	(I guess that is now Enron Americas!) --Sally
537	Please print for me.
537	Thanks.
538	I have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by London.
538	Do you have a hard copy that I can see?
538	I can get it from you during the Risk Forum luncheon today.
538	Thanks.
539	Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.
539	Let me know if you think of other ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.
539	Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.
539	I know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on Wednesday morning.
539	I have made Thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I will be glad to cover it.
539	Your company will be the very best thing that you can bring.
539	We are looking forward to having you all here.
539	(The sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!)
540	I am glad that the information that I sent was useful to you.
540	I had originally planned to be at Wellesley for the interviews on campus.
540	I now have business commitments in Houston that will keep me from making the trip.
540	But I am certainly glad that you are included in the interviews.
540	Please feel free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the interview process.
540	--Sally
541	Please put this on my calendar.
541	I can't get this to print and it is too small for me to read!
542	Pecan pie would be great - I have tried but do not do that very well, but I love it.
542	I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie, so pecan would be a great addition.
542	Mom is going to do the rolls.
542	We will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you - improvements in those quarters as well.
542	I recently cleaned out the guest room closet, bought new towels and have ordered new luggage racks.
542	We will use the old luggage racks in the media room.
542	Cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there, however, so Cara and Chris won't suffer too much.
543	Andrew Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.
543	We should get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.
543	There is sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification procedures.
543	And then there is system failure and the requisite back up.
544	Please let Brent know that I will be on vacation on Monday, November 20th.
544	I will actually be in the office for meetings from 12:00 to 5:00 that day, but I will be vacation that morning!!
544	Thanks.
544	--Sally
545	I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC Meeting.
545	ENA Management Committee I represented some of you during the mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to represent.
545	I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and Associates Program.
545	You will note that I have asked your supervisor to provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as well as a description of your job responsibilities.
545	You may want to take charge of creating this information.
545	In addition to the input that I have requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).
545	While the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I have some background information on you.
545	My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC meeting.
545	These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 and December 4.
545	I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.
545	Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process.
545	I will be out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I will check and respond to voice mail messages.
545	My number is x35926.
546	You are right -- we are all in the same boat.
546	Or plane - or not on a plane.
546	I have tried to get the Associates PRC meeting date switched with the Analyst PRC meeting (scheduled for December 12th).
546	This switch actually was arranged last week by working with Jana G. in the AA Program.
546	However, Charlene Jackson has apparently taken exception to that and is reportedly talking with Dave Delainey about this.
546	Keep me posted, and I will let you know if I hear anything new.
546	--Sally
547	Please print and put this in my folder for PRC.
547	Thanks.
548	Thanks for the note.
548	The family is doing well -- keeping us busy with a teenager driver, one in junior high and Tyler who is almost three.
548	Hope that you and your family are doing well.
548	I know that you must be busy at EES.
548	Enjoy this upcoming holiday season.
548	--Sally
549	Thanks for keeping me posted on the PRC meeting.
549	I will make travel plans for the afternoon of December 13th accordingly.
549	--Sally
550	I will be out of the office tomorrow and I have asked Mary Solmonson to attend in my place.
550	Have a great Thanksgiving!
550	--Sally
551	Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?
551	You will have to explain to me what the issue was.
551	Thanks.
551	--Sally
552	I am out of the office all day on Wednesday.
552	--Sally Brenda Flores-Cuellar@ENRON
553	I will be out of the office on Tuesday, so have a great time without me.
553	Have a great Thanksgiving.
553	--Sally Brenda Flores-Cuellar@ENRON
554	Thanks -- definitely not too late.
554	--Sally
555	Thanks for the resume.
555	She has had some good experience.
555	Do you know much about her performance here at Enron?
555	Can I call and talk with her directly?
555	I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.
555	--Sally
556	Thanks for this info.
556	I will call the students this week.
556	With your notes, it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired number of 6.
556	Keep me posted on what we hear from the students.
556	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
557	Is this what you have from AA as a format/information that they are comfortable with?
557	--Sally
558	The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott Tholen's team to my operations team.
558	(This makes a lot of sense, since it is our group that prepares all of these reports.) Fernley Dyson has requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.
558	In insuring a tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access to the Enron-wide DPR.
558	Thanks.
559	Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM and EGM.
559	Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.
559	There are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be held on Friday, December 8.
559	I invite you to sit in on any or all of these meetings if you would like to do so.
559	The most meaningful meeting will be on December 8th.
559	In that meeting, we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.
559	I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting will not take too long.
559	We will then review in more detail the managers, who will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.
559	We will also review and rank the directors and senior directors.
559	I can also be prepared to review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.
559	Call me if you have any questions.
559	--Sally
560	I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston.
560	There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.
560	The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.
560	(In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.) The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.
560	We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.
560	I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.
560	Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.
560	We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.
560	This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.
560	We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.
560	We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.
560	Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.
560	(We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.) I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.
560	I do not know yet if she will attend.
560	Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?
560	I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.
560	Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?
560	Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?
560	Let me know your thoughts.
560	-Sally
561	Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike, but forgot to do so before my initial send.
561	Here it is...
562	Thanks for sending the announcement to me.
562	You will be a great asset to EBS.
562	And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations staff members!
562	Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role.
562	--Sally
563	Can you coordinate the Scott Tholen's team to do this ASAP?
563	Thanks.
563	Keep me updated on when Fernley will have access.
563	Thanks.
564	I have this on my calendar.
564	I have jury duty on Tuesday starting at 8:00 am.
564	I hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as I can.
564	So I should be able to make the meeting at 4:00.
564	I will call you if I get hung up at the court house.
564	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
565	She was Superior - top of the table.
565	Her written review should be in the file.
565	Let me know if HR can not produce that for you and I can get you a copy.
565	--Sally
566	Thanks for the heads up.
566	I get so many of these requests and never can tell what is being requested!
566	Your note made this one fast and easy to handle.
566	Thanks.
567	I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.
567	While wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.
567	I will call in and let Patti know my status.
568	I will be attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting on December 7th.
568	It starts at 8:00 and may not take the entire day.
568	I will talk with Wes and see what he anticipates for timing to let you know if it makes sense to schedule me to interview.
568	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
569	I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.
569	You had included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.
569	Brent Price's name is missing.
569	I would put him in the Excellent category at this time.
569	Let me know if you need anything else.
569	It is possible that I may change a few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct reports who supervise certain directors.
569	I will let you know.
569	--Sally
570	I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.
570	Kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half of the year.
570	I would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.
570	I guess that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.
570	--Sally
571	I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions.
571	Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.
571	When would be a good time for you?
571	The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.
571	I know that it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while here, it could be worth it.
571	--Sally
572	I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.
572	The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work.
572	I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.
573	Thanks for including me.
573	Unfortunately, I will be out of town at an offsite meeting with the ENA management team from December 13 - 16.
573	--Sally
574	FYI
575	Is there anything that I can do to help you and Jo?
575	Tyler has school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but my nanny is at home with him on the other days.
575	Would it help for her to take Albert?
575	--Sally
576	Flight times are good.
576	Please insure that my hotel reservation is for a non-smoking room.
576	Thanks.
576	--Sally
577	To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge.
577	The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.
577	I will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings.
577	I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled!
577	Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.
577	I sat by Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve on another jury.
578	Sorry that I didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday.
578	I was conducting lots of business back and forth with the Houston office during the drive and just ran out of time.
578	We reconvene in court this morning, to have what I hope will be final deliberation on sentencing, having found the guy guilty on both counts, (Prior to the start of a trial, the defendant must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant is found guilty - he chose the jury.) I am in the office now for an 8:30 meeting with Jeff Skilling regarding the upcoming Associates PRC meeting, to which I am a rep.
578	If I don't get a chance to reach you today, I will call during my commute tomorrow.
578	--Sally By the way, I thought that when I put "Energy Executive" as my occupation on the jury summons form, that I would be deemed to be too conservative and too corporate to be chosen for the jury.
578	Not the case!
578	In fact, Mark Koenig (Enron's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as well, and he too was chosen to be on a different jury!
578	The whole thing is actually very fascinating - just bad timing for me to be out so much this week.
578	But then, there never is a good time.
579	I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th was not opened by HR.
579	Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for clarification on Brent Price.
579	This was the second e:mail that I had sent to Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.
579	My first message had noted for Kim that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.
579	Can you clarify this for me?
579	Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.
579	Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level: Superior Excellent Strong Satisfactory Needs Improv.
579	Issues Hall Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner Directors Thomas Mills Superty Henenberg Perez Wilson Venturatos
580	I have been on jury duty since Tuesday this week - I had Patti call Chris today and let him know that I would get back with him next week.
580	I will keep you posted as I have time to focus on that next week.
580	Thanks for following up!
580	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
581	I'm glad to know that she is home.
581	I can just imagine how much fun those oxygen treatments will be!
581	I know that you will be thankful to have your whole family under the same roof.
581	--Sally
582	I am resending this memo regarding the information that I need from you as Cheryl Ingstad's supervisor as I prepare to represent her in the Associates PRC meeting next week.
582	I am tied up in other PRC meetings on December 7, 8 and 11, so I am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week.
582	Please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information that I need.
582	I do have copies of the internal feedback forms and Cheryl's self-evaluation.
582	Let me know if you have any questions.
582	I know that things are very busy right now, but it is important to the Associates that their reps in the PRC process are well prepared.
582	Your input will help me with that.
582	Thanks.
582	--Sally
583	Please print this memo and attachments in color for me.
583	Thanks.
583	--Sally
584	I am not available to interview on December 7th.
584	I will be in a PRC meeting.
584	Try me next time!
584	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
585	Thanks for letting us know about Blake.
585	I just tried to reach him and left a congratulatory message on his answering machine.
586	January 27th and February 24th sound good.
586	Meagan has a big dance on Jan. 27th, and I need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures.
586	February 17th is our anniversary (22nd!!), so that is probably not a good date either.
586	So if you can make one of the other two dates work, I would love to come.
586	Just keep me posted.
587	Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?
587	As busy as life is between work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch!
587	Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.
587	I noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day...
587	(Just kidding!) Hope you all are doing fine.
587	I was on jury duty three days last week - really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.
587	I have been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be off the week of December 18th.
588	As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of Directors.
588	Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.
588	In conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily report from Ted on component V@R.
588	Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston time) to let me know about this requirement.
588	Obviously, we want to meet Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and complete as possible.
588	Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component V@R.
588	(Mike: I assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 8:30 meeting.) I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh and me at 4:00 today.
588	Realizing that the time was very late in London, we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting.
588	Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.
588	Here is the key fact to know: It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.
588	The Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.
588	With this timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by approximately 10:00 am Houston time.
588	Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston time (10:00 am London time).
588	If this time frame is not met, then component V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.
588	We had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London requirement for officialized books.
588	The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.
588	Those V@R calculations that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the component V@R calculations.
588	While there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less material than the UK spread options.
588	Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed.
588	Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.
588	I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.
588	We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.
588	It is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning.
588	Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.
589	Whew!!
589	Your schedule makes me tired!
589	I am sure that Brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!
589	Work sounds crazy for you, but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.
589	I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.
589	The week is kind of crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.
589	Sunday the 17th we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick friends, etc. It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.
589	It will be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to continue.
589	On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to Longview for a visit.
589	A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us from the trip.
589	So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin after 4:00 on Monday.
589	We could be back by the time David and company return to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.
589	Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley Theater, sans Tyler.
589	Thursday I am having all of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.
589	And Friday is Tyler's birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, but nothing else done yet!).
589	So I really think that our only shot to make it to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.
589	I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for Christmas.
589	I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope that doesn't mess up your Christmas.
589	They have only been here for one or two Christmases with us since we have had kids.
589	I think that Tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled.
589	And next year they will have 2 grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come.
589	She said she would think about it, and I told her that I wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come.
589	How about Dad playing golf this week?
589	What a difference!!
589	I am so glad that he is doing better.
589	I hear you about Mom.
589	I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable, unfortunately.
589	She seems to do that a lot at special occassions for Cara, doesn't she?
589	I will certainly help in any way I can.
589	And I will be very interested in the gosipy details.
589	Happy baking!
589	I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 27 packages of fudge.
590	This is hilarious!
590	I am laughing outloud!!
591	Good memo - let me know if you see results.
591	Enron North America Corp.
592	I had lunch with Barry yesterday and suggested that they might benefit from attending these meetings.
592	Hope you don't mind my extending that invitation.
592	--Sally
593	I hope that you got my reminder message that I was attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting today, which kept me from attending the ENW staff meeting over lunch today.
593	My remaining PRC obligations are as follows: Friday, Dec. 8 Energy Operations PRC 8:00 am until ?
593	Monday, Dec. 11 ` Enron Wholesale Services PRC 8:00 - 9:30 am Wednesday, Dec. 13 Associates 7:30 am until ?
593	The Enron Americas Management Team Offsite scheduled for Las Vegas December 13-16 had been cancelled, so I will be in the office all of next week.
594	Did you get to check on lunch plans for Thursday or Friday next week with directs?
594	This looks like it could conflict.
595	In cleaning up e:mails, I ran across this one that I had not yet read.
595	Has James called and talke with you about Enpower?
595	Are his concerns in the memo accurate?
595	Let me know.
595	--Sally
596	What is the latest on this one?
596	I gather that they are still using spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.
596	Are their positions not being captured and aggregated?
596	What does Scott Mills have to say about this?
596	--Sally
597	Thanks for the heads up.
598	Very belated reply - I am cleaning up old e:mails today, and came across this one that I had not answered.
598	Commercial does not sign confirmations at this point.
598	Too many to make that practical these days.
598	When I started the confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time.
598	Once they knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.
598	In the early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.
598	Obviously interested in the details of every deal that was done.
598	But as the business grew, that too changed.
598	--Sally
599	Yes, you are nuts!
599	I can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread houses made.
599	The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely the easy route on that one.
599	I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow.
599	-Sally
600	Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?
600	Is she raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?
600	Just curious, before I send any type of response.
600	I would need details from you around the process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.
600	Surely one feeds the other?
600	--Sally
601	I will call you tonight!
602	I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update GCP.
602	I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.
602	They are the logical experts for that discussion.
602	Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.
602	Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.
602	I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.
602	James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.
602	If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.
602	As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.
602	Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.
602	I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.
602	With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.
603	??
603	Will IT resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it?
603	Someone must be giving credit the idea that "if only we had IT resources..."
603	and that those resources are active on Entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics.
603	--Sally
604	How about our resources?
604	Is there someone working on Entelligence now for us that could at least temporarily be redirected to work on updating GCP appropriately?
605	Here it is!
606	Call or e:mail - either one is great.
606	I do hope that you are working with James directly on these issues as they surface.
606	It is still not clear to me whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.
606	I will always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that will insure better information.
606	Because I can't personally do all of the work, I just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with the right management team members on my team.
606	I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.
606	I believe that the manual process that moves information from the Entelligence team to GCP has apparently not worked as well as was designed.
606	While sorry that the results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help address this.
606	James has reassigned the resources from Entelligence for now to work with Mary Gosnell on updates to GCP that I understand have been prioritized with you.
607	Thanks for following up on this.
608	Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.
608	You can mail them to me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.
608	Mike's wife decided not to make the trip, so he won't be using the tickets.
608	Jody Crook will use the other two tickets.
608	Lunch during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.
608	I will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions for lunch if that is best.
608	Or if you are game for Irma's, just let me know when you would like to come downtown.
608	--Sally
609	I meant to blind copy you on this.
609	Here it is...
610	Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me.
610	Let me know the final resolution on this one.
611	Cathy, I plan to be on vacation next week and therefore will not be at the December 18th staff meeting.
612	I left Mike a message telling him that I was forwarding this to you and that someone on your team would verify this information and get back to him.
612	His note asks for info back by Friday the 17th - Friday is the 15th and I assume that is the deadline that he intends.
612	Thanks.
612	--Sally
613	I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.
613	Since it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a good decision.
613	I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for the family next week that I can use it.
614	Thanks for the heads up.
614	I will be here all day tomorrow.
614	--Sally
615	I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting started.
615	I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office dedication, so I did not call!
615	Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.
615	My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the week between Christmas and New Years.
615	I wouldn't recommend taking your time during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.
615	Wish I could send you with a shopping list for me!!
616	FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find this note interesting.
616	Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that lure students to join them.
616	Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.
616	See note from Lexi below.
617	The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.
617	They asked that we not communicate results until after that date.
617	I did not write down all results from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me before doing so.
617	Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.
617	I am scheduled to be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results.
617	Hope that you enjoy the holidays.
617	I will be back at work right after Christmas.
617	-Sally
618	Great to hear from you.
618	I was thinking about you today.
618	I will look forward to your starting on the 29th.
618	Certainly if anything comes up with the move or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.
618	I will be glad to have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working together.
618	I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.
618	I do feel as if I have been the PRC queen recently.
618	Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the Associates PRC. I do need a break! I will be working the week after Christmas. Although we do have a holiday on December 26th, we will trading that day. Lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day. I will be in for full days on the 27th -29th. Very few commitments on the calendar for those days, so just let me know when you would like to get together. Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday. --Sally
619	Patti will send you on Monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the DPR during the holidays.
619	Please review it and make sure that the commitments we are making can be met by London.
619	Let me know if anything needs to be changed or if there is further clarification needed in the notes, keeping in mind that with the audience on the memo that I want it to be short and easy.
619	Your comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before I send this out later next week.
619	Thanks.
619	--sally
620	I will be out of the office on vacation during the week of December 18.
620	Please refer to the contact names below as needed during that week.
620	I can be reached at my home number (281-370-8568) if necessary.
620	DPR Chris Abel x33102 MPR David Maxwell x36983 Gas Operations Bob Hall x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962 Power Operations Stacey White x31870 Leslie Reeves x37962 Canadian Operations Peggy Hedstrom 403-974-6753 I will be back in the office on Wednesday, December 27 through Friday, December 29.
620	I will also be in for part of the day on Tuesday, December 26.
620	Although that is an Enron holiday, there will be appropriate logistics personnel and book administrators in the office to support trading activities that day.
621	I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed our plans for Doorstep Reviews in 2001.
621	I am asking via this note for my assistant to set up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline, methodology, Andersen's involvement and the involvement of your team.
621	I will be on vacation the week of December 18.
621	I will be working the week between Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on getting together that week.
622	Got your most recent message.
622	Your observation is correct that the Enron Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with Doorstep reviews or planning.
622	Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.
622	She did not start with the company until after Thanksgiving.
622	Since she started a couple of weeks ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised.
622	There simply has not been the time to date to expose her to Doorstep.
622	After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.
622	Before we move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.
623	The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the DPR over the next two weeks.
623	I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for trading that day.
623	The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).
623	That will work as long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.
623	Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for December 22nd.
623	If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that you provide.
623	For locations that will not calc and officialize books on Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your best estimate of trading results.
623	Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information for the worldwide trading organization.
623	I hope that all of you enjoy your holidays.
624	We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.
624	More to come...
625	Thanks for including me in the invitation to Slick Willie's.
625	Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.
625	I will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami and will not return until the morning of the 4th.
626	Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.
626	I am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to London.
626	I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.
626	David found us tickets to the game.
626	Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.
626	Hey, it's not UT, but it should still be fun to go.
626	I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.
626	But I know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!
626	I plan to be there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand observations on operational areas that may need attention.
626	Hopefully between e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.
626	Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the whole family.
626	I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives to give them this experience.
626	Have fun -- and set them straight!!
627	Good memo on contacts.
627	Thanks for copying me.
627	Have a wonderful vacation.
627	I know that you will be glad to have Jordan back with you.
627	--Sally
628	I should have included you on this contact list.
628	I will remember to do so next time.
628	I will be in the office all of this week, so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week.
629	You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response from James New.
629	Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to a same day calculation of their books.
629	Mike and I have talked about this as a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.
629	I expect to review that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion.
629	That is why you haven't yet seen the document.
629	--Sally
630	Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful.
630	I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc. It is nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!
630	I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15.
630	I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there.
630	I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.
630	How does that work with your schedule?
630	Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like?
630	I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if you don't have some time available.
630	Let me know, and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas.
630	(My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus information.) I am in the office all of this week.
630	--Sally
631	To continue to keep you in the loop - looks like Mike is moving in the right direction on this --Sally
632	The items noted look like a good start to earlier detection of issues that may require reruns of valuation.
632	Thanks for marshalling the right resources to make this happen.
632	I will look forward to seeing your process timelines for current, iterim and target final state.
632	If my trip to London in mid-January works for your schedule, maybe this is something that we could go over then.
632	--Sally
633	Can you put a referenced as of date on the spreadsheet itself?
633	If you print the spreadsheet for reference after receiving the e:mail, there is no as of date that appears on the print out of the spreadsheet.
633	Your attachment includes the date as the name of the file, but this does not appear when you simply print our the attached spreadsheet.
633	Thanks.
633	--Sally Beck
634	I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews for the first quarter.
634	As long as the New York review isn't the week of January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip.
634	Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me - I know that you are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical things that you need to handle.
634	I will try to send you a list of topics that I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting point.
634	You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while I am there.
634	Thanks.
634	--Sally
635	Thanks for letting me know.
635	I am sure that you have communicated with the Portland risk group regarding this slip up.
635	What assurances have you gotten from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?
635	Do you think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is?
635	--Sally
636	Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the notation is that information is being compiled?
636	My guess would be that the one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest number of transactions.
636	That means that the lion's share of the work is still to be done.
636	Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?
636	As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done promptly.
636	Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent Price.
636	I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get his caught up.
636	Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the RMT Confirmations?
636	Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?
636	--Sally
637	I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up.
637	I sent the note below to Kim.
637	I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization.
637	It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed.
637	That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that.
637	If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.
637	Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one that gets the phone calls.
637	The ENA organization must develop confidence in others on our team.
637	Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs.
637	Thanks.
638	I have always worked right up until my due date.
638	There is a lot of waiting and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the office in my normal routine.
638	Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.
638	I set my last date of work for Friday, May 11.
638	Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of days until Meagan was born.
638	With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.
638	She was a week late, so we just didn't know what to expect.
638	Tyler's due date was December 18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.
638	Of course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.
638	A lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready.
638	I still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed working as long as I could.
638	Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater before the baby comes.
638	You won't be able to do that for quite a while afterwards!!
639	I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.
639	Those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input.
639	Somehow, from Andrea's voice mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.
639	Those weren't on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know that I have responded to the three that were there.
639	If there was intent for me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system.
639	(Believe me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).
639	--Sally
640	Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 accomplishments.
640	You should find that when you return to the office.
640	Let me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another delivered.
640	Have a happy new year!
640	I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill team perform - and also watching some of the game.
640	Thankfully, no emotional attachment to either team in that game!
640	I just hope that we don't freeze.
640	--Sally
641	We will also have both of our cell phones with us: David 713-299-1436 Sally 713-417-1591 We will hope for a little warmer weather in Fort Lauderdale!!
641	The game is on Wednesday evening - we will do some sightseeing during the day on Wednesday.
641	I will be back in the office on Thursday afternoon.
641	Love, Sally
642	I will be out of the office on Wednesday, January 3.
642	I am married to an OU graduate, so we are headed to the Orange Bowl to hopefully see Oklahoma hang onto their number 1 ranking.
642	I will be back in the office after lunch on Thursday, January 4.
642	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be reached.
642	Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am out.
643	I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned within the last hour.
643	That probably would make next week better for me than this week.
643	Give me a call and we will set something up.
643	My number is x35926.
643	If you don't reach me, call my temp assistant (Camella - x39106) and she will be able to set up a meeting.
643	Thanks.
644	I will be there at 8:40 on Monday -- not a word until then...
645	I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.
645	Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.
645	The study was designed to cover gas and power.
645	Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.
645	Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.
645	I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.
645	Thanks for passing it along, however.
645	I would be happy to convey this directly to the person that has contacted you.
645	Just let me know his/her name and number and I will follow through on that if you would like.
645	Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good one for you.
645	--Sally
646	I have a standing staff meeting that I attend on Monday mornings, so I will not be available when you and James meet on the 8th.
646	I will look forward to getting with James after your meeting for an update.
647	I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.
647	I bought a book at Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.
647	I found the name of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.
647	Another place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.
647	Both meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.
647	I will get info on both and we can look at it.
647	I worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc. These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety.
647	I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the whole family.
647	One of those might catch their interest as well.
647	I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin.
647	I would like the opportunity to be together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!
647	Even though Dad is doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this.
647	Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be a toss up, but maybe worth the try.
647	Let's share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going.
648	I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.
648	The purpose of this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.
648	I know that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or are currently providing services to outside parties.
648	While there are efforts underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office services.
648	I hope that you will be able to attend.
648	Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.
649	Absolutely - Clara should have been included.
649	I asked for a list of managers and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution list.
649	Her list omitted Clara.
649	All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of our year-end PRC process.
649	I don't think that I got consistent info from everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists.
649	Thanks for catching this.
649	--Sally
650	I am so sorry to hear about your dad.
650	I did not know that he had passed away.
650	I know that he has been very ill.
650	My thoughts are with you and your family.
650	I know that it must hard to say goodbye to someone that has been such a part of your life for so long.
650	We will miss you on the 11th, but certainly understand your absence.
650	--Sally
651	I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!
651	My husband (an OU grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and see the team absolutely stop FSU.
651	If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are on vacation, please give me a call.
651	2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.
651	I hope that you will join us and be a part of that.
651	My office number is 713-853-5926.
651	If it is more convenient for you, feel free to call me at home as well.
651	That number is 281-370-8568.
651	Boomer Sooners!!!
651	Sally Beck
652	I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.
652	It is always great to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front of you.
652	No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after graduation.
652	I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about your offer while you are going through that process.
652	Enron had a fantastic year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.
652	We hope that you will be a part of that.
652	My number at work is 713-853-5926.
652	Please feel free to call me any time.
652	If it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, my home number is 281-370-8568.
652	Don't hesitate to call.
652	Sally Beck
653	I will ask Patti to set up a meeting for us this week.
653	Your name has been on my list to call - a trip to the Orange Bowl last week cut my week short, so I will look forward to getting with you this week.
653	--Sally
654	Sounds good to me.
655	Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.
655	Congratulations on the baby!
655	I hope that you are feeling well.
655	I am so happy for you and your husband.
655	My how your lives will change!!
655	But how enriched they will be.
655	Our three are so much fun.
655	I will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.
655	If you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me know.
655	I would be glad to share my experience with you.
655	--Sally
656	I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.
656	I have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not get a message about undeliverable e:mail.
656	I haven't heard back from him.
656	The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.
656	I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in Austin.
656	(It would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks.) I was on vacation the week before Christmas and for two days last week.
656	And I admit that I did not contact any students while I was on vacation!
656	I will try their Austin numbers this week again.
656	Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to Austin early.
656	Similar situation with my OU students.
656	I have conversed by e:mail since I did not have home numbers.
656	Do you know when classes resume at OU?
656	I will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early.
656	I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.
656	(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!) I have an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made.
656	If you have a few minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.
656	Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well?
656	I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.
656	Let me know.
656	--Sally
657	I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.
657	So it is gone - but not sent!!
657	Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.
658	Great - I will add her name to the distribution list so that she will get our upcoming note on the location for this meeting.
658	Thanks.
658	Enron North America Corp.
659	I will be out of town on January 19, so Brenda Herod has agreed to make the presentation for Rick Causey.
659	Please replace my name with hers for all communication regarding this Analyst Orientation.
659	Thanks.
660	Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!
660	Meagan called this afternoon to tell me the news.
660	I will perhaps get more details when I get home tonight.
660	I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.
660	Let us know what we can do to help.
660	I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.
660	We will be anxious to meet our newest neighbor.
660	--Sally
661	I knew that you would still be in London.
661	Just thought that I would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on.
661	Yes, I will be in London next week.
661	Plan to fly over on Sunday night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.
661	I will be there through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.
661	Let's definitely plan to get together.
661	I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my schedule for next week.
661	I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together.
661	Looking forward to it.
661	--Sally
662	Jeff, thanks for taking care of this for Fred.
662	--Sally
663	I will attend the meeting on Thursday, but will have to leave around 1:15 to make it to a meeting at the Doubletree where I am speaking at 1:30.
663	Thanks.
664	Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.
664	I would love to be closer to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.
664	Any suggestions?
664	If not something close to the office, would you suggest another spot besides 47 Park?
664	I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the office tonight.
664	I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.
664	--Sally
665	I love it!!
665	I think that is perfect.
665	Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else.
665	That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, assuming that works for everyone.
665	Removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too.
665	Hyatt Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.
665	There is a newer resort in the area also.
665	I can't think of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you.
665	--Sally
666	The other place in San Antonio is Westin's La Canterra.
666	I will contact both and get info.
666	Then we should make reservations soon.
666	I'll call Cindy tonight and fill her in. -Sally
667	This one is pretty funny...
668	Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.
668	I was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at that point.
668	Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week: review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same day, to replicate, if appropriate, an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (you and I can review early in the week what we are doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your business controllers in the London office who will participate in Doorstep reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input on how to continually improve the process), discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up London's information for the corporate DPR do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial.
668	Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.
668	I will also spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.
668	And I plan to meet with Fernley as well.
668	Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?
668	I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday.
669	Thanks!
669	I understand that congratulations are in order for you, too.
669	We should definitely do dinner and celebrate.
669	I think that Niki has arranged that for Thursday night.
669	I will look forward to it.
669	--Sally
670	Let's plan on Monday night for dinner.
670	Someone included me on the distribution list for your going away bash, so I have put that on my calendar for Wednesday night as well.
670	--Sally
671	I am glad that you asked!
671	I will be happy to bring your things back for you.
671	Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.
671	It will be easy to do this.
671	--Sally
672	Thanks for the responses -- all look great.
672	I like coming over knowing that my calendar will be pretty full.
672	Dinner sounds great, too.
672	I am having dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment.
672	I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.
672	Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was smooth.
672	--Sally
673	Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for your schedule).
673	I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost.
673	Either way, consider it done.
673	I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.
673	However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment.
673	Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form?
673	I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner.
673	I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.
673	I don't know whether or not you included that on your list.
673	Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!
673	I wonder if that could be a problem on the 31st?
673	You never know with Houston weather.
673	What do you think?
673	We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned by Irma's son, Luis).
673	I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure that plans are progressing on this.
673	We will include our recent OU grads as well.
673	I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see at the end of January.
673	--Sally
674	Your note has made my day.
674	Thanks for taking the time to send it.
674	Your thoughts and support mean a lot to me.
674	How lucky I am to have you for a sister and friend!
674	--Sally
675	Thanks for the note.
675	I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonight who is in the office late!
675	I was told that the memo would come out today - you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!
675	I am really pleased about how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and its importance to the organization.
675	And yes, we need more female names on these lists!
675	--Sally
676	There isn't much to the memo, but this is it!
676	It came out well after the eof the work day for most folks.
676	I believe that Patti has sent you my traveplans for next week.
676	Have a great weekend!
677	Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend.
677	Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?
677	This will be a meeting that we should have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and make timely decisions on how to handle those.
677	I am sure that there is some prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.
677	I would assume that we should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk books, OA, etc. Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.
677	I would love for us take charge and lead this meeting.
677	--Sally
678	Please put details of this meeting on my calendar.
678	Thanks.
679	I will be in London the week of January 15th.
679	I understand from Beth that you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.
679	Beth and I plan to have dinner that night.
679	Will you be back in town later in the week?
679	I have business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.
679	Could you make dinner on Wednesday night (the 17th)?
679	There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.
679	I have a belated Christmas gift for you.
679	Hope we can get together!
679	--Sally PS Am staying at 47 Park.
680	It will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping EIM to grow.
680	I hope that you enjoy your new rotation.
680	--Sally
681	I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you will both be glad for her to return home.
681	I have mentioned to you before, Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.
681	That is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.
681	Barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.
681	If you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to contact Barbara.
681	In addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy meeting.
681	I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you.
681	I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on merit increases from there.
681	I will be back in the office on Monday, January 22.
681	-Sally Enron North America Corp.
682	Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.
682	In keeping with other reviews, I would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.
682	We should also send a short memo to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the reviews.
682	I should probably send that to them.
682	Can you remind me when I am back in town the week of January 22?
682	Thanks.
682	Enron North America Corp.
683	Leslie: Can you attend this meeting for me?
683	I will be in London.
683	Patti: Can you get time and location for Leslie and let them know that she will be there instead of me?
683	Thanks.
684	Please print attachment and make sure that e:mail addresses are included for the students.
684	Call Ted if any problems.
684	Thanks.
684	We will need this to send invitations to students and Ted (plus some Enron folks) to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on January 31.
684	Let's talk about arranging details.
684	thanks.
685	I don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this.
685	I believe that to address what seems to be David's concerns would be better handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a directed timeframe with a well defined scope.
685	We purposefully utilize differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world.
686	Cathy: I will be working in the London office during the week of January 15, so I will not be at the staff meeting on January 16.
686	--Sally
687	I will be working in the London office Monday through Thursday, January 15 - 18 and will be be flying back to Houston on Friday, January 19.
687	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has a contact numbers for me in London.
687	I will be checking voice mail and e:mail regularly while I am there.
687	Key contacts in Houston next week will be: DPR and MPR Shona Wilson x39123 Gas Operations Jeff Gossett x37306 (in Chicago office Jan. 16 & 17) Bob Hall x36956 Power Operations Stacey White x31870 Leslie Reeves x37962
688	Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President!
688	Well deserved and a nice way to cap off your stay in London.
688	I look forward to celebrating with you in London next week.
688	--Sally
689	Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.
689	Well deserved, and a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of the Calgary office.
689	--Sally
690	Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London office during the week of January 15.
690	I will arrive just after lunch on Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.
690	Much of my time will be spent with Fernley and Mike Jordan.
690	If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.
690	I will stop by while I am in the office.
690	--Sally
691	Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.
691	I have the dubious honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of the promotional memo via e:mail.
691	I will be in the London office next week and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.
691	I look forward to the chance to visit with you then.
691	--Sally
692	The promotional memo came out a couple of hours too late for me to be able to mention it to you on the phone this afternoon.
692	Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.
692	--Sally
693	The promotional memo came out a few hours too late today for me to be able to mention it when we talked this afternoon.
693	Congratulations on your promotion to managing director!
693	--Sally
694	Patti: Please forward this message to Tom Hopwood.
694	Tom: The good (or bad) news was that I was here late enough to see the memcome out on e:mail Friday night.
694	Most will see this on Tuesday after theholiday.
694	I did get a few calls tonight from a hardy few that were still here in the office.
694	I will call you when I am back from London.
694	Thanks for allof your help this week on the two meetings.
694	--Sally
695	Thanks for your note.
695	Yes, this definitely starts the year off nicely.
695	Hope your holidays were wonderful and that 2001 is a good year for you and your family, too.
695	--Sally
696	Thanks for your nice note.
696	I am pleased for all of us at the increased recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton.
696	My ability to do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in operations.
696	Thanks for your part in that and for your continued support.
696	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
697	Thanks for your nice note.
697	I hope that you are having fun in your new role.
697	We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing now.
697	--Sally
698	I can access the global compensation system from London.
698	Today I have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday for bonus and LTI.
698	I assume that I will be able to access the screens for merits as well.
698	Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.
698	I will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations.
698	I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations.
698	Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.
698	Outside this process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by Todd Burke.
698	We can process those agreed upon requests, but will not include those dollars within our merit totals.
698	That way, won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets.
698	Better not to ask for exceptions on everything!!!
698	What is the word on bonus dollars?
698	Is everything finalized as I submitted?
698	Let me know.
698	If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where you can reach me.
698	Thanks.
699	Had trouble finding your e:mail address the first time around for this memo.
700	Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.
700	What a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of EnronOnline.
700	--Sally
701	Thanks for your note.
701	I hope that things are going well for you at EBS.
701	I know that it must be busy.
701	--Sally
702	Thanks for your nice note.
702	Haven't seen you in a while - hope that all is going well for you.
702	--Sally
703	Thanks for your nice note.
703	I hope that within my team that they see the promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as meaningful.
703	All of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people that make my job easier and more fun!
704	Thanks for your nice note.
704	--Sally
705	Thanks for your nice note.
705	I do hope that everyone on my team sees the promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform.
705	All that should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job easier and more fun!
705	I will ask Patti to schedule some time for us to get together when I am back in the office next Monday.
705	Have a good week.
705	---Sally
706	Thanks for you nice note.
706	I miss seeing you on 33.
706	Hope that all is going well for you.
706	--Sally
707	Michelle: This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.
707	Will you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary?
707	I am in the London office this week, so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me.
707	Thanks.
707	--Sally Beck Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and Calgary.
707	Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.
707	This focus on operational risk management will ensure the quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across all commodities in 2001.
708	Thanks for your note on the promotion.
708	Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and dinner for Ted and his students from OU.
708	She should contact you for a list of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.
708	I hope that you have that date on your calendar!
708	I will ask MIke McConnell if he would like to join us, too.
709	Let's try the last row window seat.
709	Thanks.
709	Enron North America Corp.
710	Thanks for your note on the promotion.
710	This was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there.
710	I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.
710	In fact, I mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.
710	He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).
710	I filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.
710	I am in the London office this week.
710	Call Patti and ask her to schedule a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.
710	I will look forward to it.
710	Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).
710	Patti is working on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of his students while they are in town for NAPE.
710	--Sally
711	Thanks for your nice note.
711	I certainly follow your career with interest.
711	I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the wedding picture with your Christmas card.
711	What a great picture - you look beautiful and happy.
711	Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.
711	My best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.
711	Maybe next year...
711	I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.
711	I will see Mo tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.
711	See you next week!
711	--Sally
712	Thanks - a nice start to the year.
712	--Sally
713	Thanks for doing this.
713	I plan to come to London once a quarter.
713	I will have to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full!
713	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
714	Please check on those marked below Enron North America Corp.
715	Thanks for your nice note.
715	I have fun being here, which makes all of this even better!
715	--Sally
716	I have reviewed my section of Causey's presentation ( to be given by Brenda) and all looks fine except for page with world map.
716	Can we add Portland to the map?
716	That is the true trading location that is missing.
716	If it is tough to do, don't worry about it.
716	Thanks.
716	--Sally
717	Thanks for your nice note.
717	I hope that everyone in the group sees this as a recognition of the value of the role that we play within Enron.
717	That will help us in attracting and retaining talented people, which makes my job easier and more fun.
717	--Sally
718	Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.
718	I appreciate your nice thoughts.
718	I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could bring back for you?
718	Just let me know.
718	I will be back in the office next Monday, the 22nd.
718	--Sally
719	Any room at the inn?
719	I am looking for a spot for Beth Apollo.
719	She will be working with me, starting on January 29th in Houston.
719	--Sally I am in London this week, but if you have any ideas Patti can follow through while I am out.
720	For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.
720	I sent Wes a message and copied you on that.
720	I can't remember the name of the person who works for Wes that handles moves.
720	Lisa filled in for her while she was out on medical leave.
720	She is back.
720	Can you get with her right away and see what you can come up with?
720	Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.
720	Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that Lisa is gone.
720	Can you check with her, too?
720	Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our (Energy Ops) move off of 30.
720	I don't know who is left on 30.
720	Can you get the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 so that I can get back with Jeff this week?
720	Thanks.
720	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
721	Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and would choose to go elsewhere.
721	Would be nice to have them behind bars, however.
721	Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad idea, does it?
721	I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.
721	Any new news on those 7?
721	--Sally
722	Congratulations on the baby - August seems like a long time away, but given how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.
722	I would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime.
722	I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week of the 22nd.
722	Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit about options.
722	--Sally
723	I am in the London office this week, so I won't be able to attend.
723	Brenda Flores-Cuellar@ENRON
724	I assume that this request relates to corporate functions under Rick.
724	As of this moment, my team and I have not yet been granted access to merit information in the comp system.
724	I am in London this week, but have been in touch with my HR rep each day.
724	Latest word is that he aniticipates that we will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today.
724	Our deadline to submit merit increases is Monday, January 22.
724	SInce it is already after lunch on Wednesday here in London and we do not yet have access to the system, it is likely that my direct reports will work on merits over the next two days.
724	Since I will be in the air on Friday, it will be Monday before I have the opportunity to review all inputs from my direct reports and finalize merits.
724	--Sally
725	The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.
725	Weather here is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.
725	Very useful trip - they have my schedule very full, including dinners every night.
725	I will be in the office through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.
725	I will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back home).
725	We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.
725	We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.
725	There will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).
725	Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be different.
725	Glad they are here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus...
725	Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.
725	--Sally
726	Thanks for your nice note.
726	It is always interesting to scan the list and do a count of other females names.
726	Were not too many on this latest list.
726	We will have to work on changing that.
726	--Sally
727	Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do in Houston.
727	I feel very in touch.
727	Sounds like you have been busy - I think that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.
727	Thanks for taking care of all of this.
727	London is cold but sunny - so very nice.
727	I do love coming here - hope to make the trip once a quarter this year.
727	I will be back at home by Friday evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the meeting.
727	Otherwise I will see you on Sunday.
727	Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from the girls on presentation.
727	I think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful to have their input.
727	They are the honorees.
727	Oh, well .....as you say, this is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole thing.
727	--Sally
728	Thanks for your note.
728	I will copy Patti on this reply and ask her to set us up for lunch when I am back from London.
728	--Sally
729	Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.
729	That will make good airplane material tomorrow.
729	If I make any changes I will try to fax pages to you after David picks me up at the airport tomorrow.
729	If I don't make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you know that.
729	My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.
729	Thanks for your comments., I must admit, I am really excited about the promotion.
729	We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be.
729	It will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.
729	I am certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.
729	Luckily a different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.
729	I expect it to be a busy year.
729	You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered.
729	Target is to be finished by the end of January .
729	I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.
729	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
730	Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we used last year for headcount addtions.
730	Let's complete those for these positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.
730	They need to understand the addtional cost associated with these requests.
730	They will forget later in the year if they aren't making much money.
730	Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?
730	--Sally
731	Thanks.
731	This will definitely help me.
731	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
732	Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on my calendar tentatively.
732	I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.
732	I assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.
732	While I have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold those dates.
732	I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 would be better.
732	--Sally
733	The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.
733	It is at Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria Station.
733	Quick walk from the office.
733	Apparently, there is another location at Covent Gardens.
733	Dinner last night was fun.
733	It is always great to see you either in Houston or London.
733	Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.
733	I think that the taxi driver was afraid that we would get him killed!
733	I called home last night and told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.
733	She is ready!!
733	Let us know when you will next be in Houston.
733	I should be here quarterly - probably head back in March or April.
733	--Sally
734	Thanks, Sarah!
734	I was so focused on getting that in the mail that I obviously didn't proof the content very well.
734	Thanks for looking out for me!
734	--Sally
735	Thanks for your note.
736	Can you get me info on the options with Dell?
736	I won't make it by to speak with them myself today.
736	Thanks.
737	This is some of the data that we need...
738	Thanks for your nice note.
738	--Sally
739	Audience for the report?
739	Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list?
739	May make a difference in information provided.
739	We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office operations in the report.
739	Would you also like some operating data - # of deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?
739	We can come up with a format and suggested content this week.
739	--Sally
740	During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL.
740	Since this is clearly on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost savings and our estimated timing on those savings.
740	I will ask James by copy of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.
740	I want to be able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings.
741	If my full e:mail address is not used, Steve Beck gets my e:mails.
741	He has forwarded this one.
741	Does it make sense to you?--Sally
742	Thanks for the congratulations.
742	David of course is pleased about the promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it!
742	Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.
742	It is always a risk to pull together an audience of 90 and deliver something worthwhile.
742	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
743	Thanks for your nice note.
743	--Sally
744	Thanks for your note.
744	Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.
744	My last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full agenda.
744	Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.
744	Do stop by when you are in the office next week.
744	I should be in town all week.
744	--Sally
745	Please put attendees on my calendar.
745	Thanks.
746	On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel idowntown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid andback office services we could offer to the commodity industry.
746	To complete a plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) attheir Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas.
746	I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desigsession.
746	This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13tin Dallas, Texas.
746	This work session is based on a unique approach called a DesignShopv.
746	It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is composed of various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups.
746	If youhave not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely regard this session as different from any working session you have previousexperienced.
746	The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have provento be very successful.
746	Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.
746	A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.
746	You wereselected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in thDesignShop.
746	You are being asked to participate in the full two days with aslittle distraction or interruption as possible.
746	The quality of our resultsdepends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for theentire event.
746	Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to supporand communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session.
746	This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods sthat your participation can be maximized.
746	Therefore, please make all necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions duringthese two days.
746	Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,and transportation.
746	Preliminary information as to schedule and environmenthas also been included.
746	You may direct any additional questions concerningthe event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.
746	I hope that you will be able to participate.
746	Please confirm your attendancfor the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00p.m.
746	If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someoneelse to participate.
746	Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else totake your place until you and I have discussed this.
746	I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yoin Dallas!
747	FYI.
747	Forgot to cc: you on this.
747	PT
748	And you and your bride haven't set Dallas as a honeymoon destination????
748	Your excuse seems to be a good one.
748	We will miss your presence and participation, however.
748	Enjoy the wedding!!--Sally
749	Thanks for your note and welcome back to Enron.
749	I am so pleased that you have returned.
749	I, too, look forward to working with you.
749	--Sally
750	FYI on VNG...
751	Melissa Allen, formerly with Arthur Andersen and assigned to the Enron account, has taken over Beth Apollo's role for EEL.
751	She reports to Fernley Dyson, as did Beth.
751	I was in the London office last week.
751	As a result of some of my discussions, Mike Jordan asked that James Scribner make a visit to cover the operations pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty database.
751	Mike has suggested that James come to London during the first week in February, which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip.
751	Please coordinate with James so that your agendas are in sync (in case of potential overlap) so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of coordination.
751	Since your agenda mentions GCP, there may some meetings that you are planning that would be appropriate for James to join.
751	By copy of this memo, I am asking James to do the same with you.
751	Thanks.
752	Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.
752	What a pretty name!
752	I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.
752	I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that you are probably a bit sleep deprived.
752	That will pass - although with your first one that is really hard to believe.
752	Please stop by as soon as you have pictures.
752	I would love to see them.
752	--Sally
753	I hear that Dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week.
753	Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus.
753	Mom does seem to like that Heart Hospital...
753	Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to you.
753	Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!!
753	We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty - a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.
753	Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.
753	It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!
753	Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.
753	Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.
753	I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.
753	Hope all is well with the three of you.
753	Are you making the trip to Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?
753	I am not going to make it - need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!
753	Love, Sally
754	Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over Thanksgiving.
754	Not filled yet for that time period.
754	They are sending me a brochure.
754	Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have only king size beds and sleep two persons.
754	There are 2 rooms that have two beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.
754	They do have baby beds.
754	Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.
754	I would probably take two rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.
754	But we would probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.
754	As we all know, five is almost too many in one room and bathroom.
754	I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds like a good plan.
754	Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?
755	Not sure that this reached you the first time.
755	My address was flawed.
756	FYI - Check my voice mail message that I left for you and call me when you can.
757	She will check with Dad and let you know?????
757	I don't quite get all of this either.
757	Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a plan?
757	(Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the occassion.) Who knows...
757	Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that too.
757	--Sally
758	Thanks for your note.
758	I do believe that this indicates a recognition within the organization of the importance of the work of the whole group.
758	That is nice to see!!--Sally
759	Glad to hear that we are getting there.
759	Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) is really good.
759	They do a great job of serving.
759	At past Enron dinners, they have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a nice keepsake.
759	Maybe we can do this.
759	--Sally
760	FYI - The details below take care of the Hess "sharing arrangement" that we discussed yesterday.
760	--Sally
761	This looks great.
761	Do you need me for either of those two dates?
761	How was dinner last night?
761	Sorry that I couldn't stay, but I know that the students were in good hands.
761	Who else attended from Enron?
761	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
762	Can you upgrade me to first class?
763	I will look forward to talking with Norma.
763	Thanks for suggesting that she contact me.
763	--Sally
764	Watch for her call.
764	Ask her to send me a resume to review and set up a meeting when convenient.
764	Thanks.
765	Please put the dates referenced below on my calendar.
765	You may need to get more details from Lexi.
765	Thanks.
766	I agree - he does look like a good candidate.
766	Please do go ahead with a phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him.
766	Thanks.
766	Enron North America Corp.
767	Here is the info on the meeting in Dallas.
767	I am glad that you will be ableto join us.
767	--Sally
768	Just a quick note to see how you are doing.
768	I mentioned your name today to Kristin Albrecht.
768	She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron Broadband Services (EBS).
768	Kristin and I used to work together in Enron Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.
768	She grew up in Wharton and is an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things in common.
768	I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.
768	She can be another contact for you here at Enron.
768	If you are interested in what is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.
768	Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.
768	--Sally
769	Enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off.
769	I appreciate your notes when you are out on who to contact.
769	Have a great weekend.
769	--Sally
770	I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just returned to the office.
770	Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.
770	I hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!
770	I will look forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.
770	You do know that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with adorable pictures at all times?!
770	--Sally
771	Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.
771	Her role has changed once again at Enron!
771	She is running more of a fundamentals group at present.
771	Wanted to know if you would be interested in that.
771	Told her that I couldn't speak for you.
771	I'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest.
771	Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her.
771	You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know more and she will know you.
771	FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.
771	--Sally
772	In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that he will be in London next week on business.
772	He will arrive on Monday morning (February 5) and should be in the Enron office most of the day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
772	He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.
772	He has dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.
772	He will be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron House.
772	Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through Mike Jordan or his assistant.
772	Mike's number (don't know how many of these digits you actually need to call from there) is 011-44-207-783-4703.
772	Hope you guys get to see each other.
772	Have a great weekend.
772	--Sally
773	Seattle sounds nice.
773	Haven't made it there myself.
773	Enjoy the trip.
773	If you have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts about next steps for Joel's team.
773	--Sally Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.
773	We are addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems work.
774	I will be in the Calgary office with Peggy Hedstrom and her team next week on Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.
774	Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I could handle while I am in Calgary?
774	My agenda with Peggy and her team is pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to address.
774	Just let me know.
774	That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday.
774	I will sit in with Rob Milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the meeting.
774	I already had a meeting scheduled with all of Peggy's team during the second hour of your staff meeting.
774	Due to location constraints, we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled.
774	So I will have to step out of the staff meeting for the second hour.
775	Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves and I would like to invite you to lunch on Friday, February 9 in recognition of your promotions to Director and Senior Director.
775	We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business and feel that these promotions are worthy of celebration.
775	Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).
775	Details on time and location will follow.
775	--Sally
776	Congratulations on your promotion to Manager.
776	Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Brenda Herod and I would like to invite you to a luncheon in recognition of your promotion on Tuesday, February 6.
776	We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business.
776	We would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion.
776	Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).
776	Details on time and location will follow.
776	--Sally
777	FYI
778	I had the same reaction.
778	We didn't get much of a break between the January and February meeting!
778	Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for Feb?
778	And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?
778	I could certainly host if needed.
778	Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety?
778	I would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.
778	Any ideas on car care?
778	Seems like Joy Martin mentioned her husband as a possible "expert" there.
778	Or should we try to call Firestone or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?
778	I am headed to Calgary for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls before I leave.
778	On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.
778	I would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.
778	I can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.
778	It may be tough to get the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?
778	The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy tickets at the door ($4).
778	Problem is that SAT's are given that day.
778	Meagan is signed up to take them.
778	I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT that day?
778	If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay if Meagan misses.
778	If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.
778	Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting.
778	They could check their schedules and then we could get a count.
778	I will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.
778	I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.
778	--Sally
779	I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week.
779	Tuesday is tough, because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.
779	I can make time on Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.
779	--Sally
780	Have you seen the training tools that Avril uses for such things?
780	--Sally
781	Please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me.
781	Thanks.
781	--Sally
782	Please print Wellesley schedule - I think that I have a conflict with the date that they need me.
782	Let's discuss.
783	Thanks for the weather report.
783	I bought a good coat a couple of months ago with London and Calgary in mind.
783	Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc. I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.
783	If it would be good for you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early supper.
783	(If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would adjust!) Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds great.
783	Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by alcohol.
783	I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work - either way will work well for me.
783	--Sally
784	Thanks for the info.
784	I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow.
784	Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager (about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or senior director (smaller group).
784	To make this work while the promotion announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week for one of the lunches.
784	I will get an update from Shona.
785	I will not be able to attend.
785	-Sally
786	No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.
786	I am still in the throws of completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00.
786	I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown before I leave for the day.
786	I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom and her team.
786	Back in the Houston office on Friday.
786	Hope that James' visit is going well.
786	Thanks for getting appointments organized for him.
786	I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.
786	I am glad that you, Richard and Steve will be able to participate.
786	Are you still planning to come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?
786	I fly from Dallas to Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for summer interns on Wednesday.
786	I will be back in the office on Thursday and Friday that week.
786	Let me know if we can help in setting up any appointments.
786	We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule allows.
786	I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas meeting and to follow up on some other issues.
786	I would offer dinner on Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family will have dinner plans for me that evening.
786	Is there someone else in Houston that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?
786	--Sally
787	Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week.
787	Steve and Richard are coming as well.
787	You might tell Mike that we can provide the two of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the computer and phone for Mike.
787	And schedule some time for me to meet with him on Thursday as well.
787	I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.
787	You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with computer, network connection and phone on 33.
787	You might also offer to set up any appointments for him while is here.
787	Thanks.
788	Please print memo and attachment for me to review on the plane tomorrow.
788	Thanks.
788	--Sally
789	FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over the change in reporting for him.
789	I gave his review the end of last week, but didn't get to review the reporting change.
789	I will ask Patti to let you know when I am meeting with James on Friday.
789	Wanted you to be in the loop on this - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this to be well done.
789	The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training.
789	Looks like he still has some homework to do.
789	--Sally
790	Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.
790	I have to leave for the airport after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.
790	Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.
790	Hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting!
790	I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.
790	Another thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to an Astro's game.
790	I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.
790	I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.
790	We could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.
790	I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.
790	If not too many are tied up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.
790	Thanks for making the calls.
790	I am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year.
790	Report from the Calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime tempurature reading!).
790	I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.
790	I will leave with David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that is needed while I am out of town.
790	--Sally
791	Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving to Connecticut soon to join her husband.
791	He has been working up there for the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.
791	She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.
791	It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.
791	She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.
791	In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.
791	She came to Houston and has done a number of different things.
791	I think that she is well organized and control minded.
791	Understands Enron's business.
791	Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.
791	I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.
791	That could be old news, however.
791	There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.
791	Do you know of her?
791	Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.
791	Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.
791	She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.
791	They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.
791	Could mean lower cost that way.
791	This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.
791	If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.
791	Let me know.
791	--Sally
792	Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.
792	Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.
792	I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him.
792	I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30.
792	Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews.
792	Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg.
792	Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.
792	That's great to have dinner with Lou.
792	I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way.
792	Are they on an Enron network?
792	Do they get Enron e:mails?
792	How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York?
792	I still suspect that New York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to chew on in London.
792	Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business.
792	Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.
792	They tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing.
792	It snowed there a lot yesterday.
792	Of course, according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in Calgary.
792	I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.
792	--Sally
793	Please change this on my calendar.
793	Thanks.
794	I will be working in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.
794	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.
794	I will be back in the Houston office on Friday, February 9.
794	Key contacts in Houston over the next two days are: DPR Chris Abel x33102 MPR David Maxwell x36983 Gas Operations Bob Hall x36956 Power Leslie Reeves x37962 Operations Stacey White x31870
795	Wouldn't it be the four of us?
795	- You, me, Cara and baby to be named?
795	Good idea.
795	I'll call you this weekend.
795	Sorry didn't reply earlier - was in Calgary.
795	--Sally
796	Thanks for your vote of confidence.
796	I don't think that it is out of the realm of possibility.
796	As we know with all Enron reorg's, what we can count on is that this will change!
796	We'll miss Delainey in Enron Americas, but as a shareholder I am glad that he will be at EES.
796	Have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there.
796	I will keep you posted.
796	--Sally
797	I will be at a meeting in Dallas next Monday and will be unable to attend.
797	--Sally
798	Please print attachment for me.
798	Thanks.
799	Please process this request ASAP.
799	Thanks, Sally Beck
800	Thanks for lining this up.
800	I am glad that they were available on the 2nd.
800	--Sally
801	I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the cost too much by looking around.
801	Cara, would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card?
801	Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours, so I would be glad to do so.
801	I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.
801	This is a good year for me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary party, David and I were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and Richard covered a lot of the costs.
801	Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward to good use.
801	--Sally
802	Save the date note would be great if you can do that.
802	--Sally
803	Don't I know...they are smart and loving, but a little short on the details sometimes, aren't they!
803	--Sally
804	You and Frank can best decide how to organize this.
804	I am comfortable with your decisions, so feel free to go ahead with this.
804	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
805	Please change location of this meeting for this week only.
805	I would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to ENW Staff Meeting with Philippe with Peggy McCurley as the contact.
805	Thanks.
806	I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring some strong candidates.
806	If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 looks good.
806	I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in Dallas.
806	With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!
806	It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.
806	Let's definitely plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.
806	I just checked the calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!
806	A few weeks away, but at least it is on the calendar!
806	If your schedule were to free up suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have lunch sooner.
806	--Sally
807	Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.
807	I will be out of the office on March 2.
807	--Sally
808	Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well.
808	despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits.
808	So do approach this as fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.
808	Looks like a good group.
808	I hope that all will attend and participate.
808	Did Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone?
808	Keep me posted on progress.
808	--Sally
809	E:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not DSL is available at my home.
809	However, I don't see a spot on the website to check that information.
809	Can you provide more details?
810	Thanks for your note.
810	It has been a nice way to start the year!
810	--Sally
811	Thanks for your note.
811	I am glad that you and Kristin are getting together.
811	--Sally
812	Thanks, Marc.
812	I would like to get together with you, Mary Solmonson and James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office services.
812	Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.
812	I will work on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a kick-off meeting.
812	--Sally
813	Looks like a permanent cancellation to me - at least for now!
813	We can work with Wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact Enron Americas.
814	Brenda Herod is in charge of Energy Operations for EIM and should be included in the invitation list.
814	Brent Price fulfills two roles for EGM - CAO and head of operations, so he is appropriately included covering both fronts.
814	Also, I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting.
814	He is a VP in Energy Operations for Enron Americas.
814	I would like for him to be on the list for this meeting as well.
814	He and I will cover for each other on this Wholesale Deal Meeting.
814	You may get both of us in attendance on occassion, but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for EA.
814	Thanks.
814	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
815	This is the replacement meeting for the Hot List meeting.
815	I have asked that you be included on the list of attendees.
815	--Sally
816	Thanks for much for your nice note.
816	Where are you working now?
816	I hate to say that I have lost track.
816	--Sally
817	Thanks for your nice note.
817	The promotion did get the year off to a nice start.
817	I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.
817	While time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.
817	Keep me posted on what you are doing.
817	--Sally
818	Thanks for your note.
819	As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).
819	Louise is now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.
819	Philippe has assumed the role as chairman of Enron Net Works.
819	Since this report is a Net Works report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and Peggy effective immediately.
819	Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution.
819	What would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?
819	--Sally
820	Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower together.
820	That was a nice group of women - and fun.
820	Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good.
820	Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than anything.
820	But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.
820	Payment plan sounds fine.
820	I am not worried about the timing on that, so don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family.
820	With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a little more certainty is on the horizon.
820	I can't think of a better place for the money to be invested than in you and your family.
820	Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for a day or weekend trip.
820	Not quite the same as being in town, though.
820	Maybe someday we will be there!
820	--Sally
821	As part of the modelling process, Marc is going to meet with James Scribner on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to review our operations pricing model.
821	If you can join them, you might find it interesting.
821	They plan to meet in James' office - EB3756.
821	--Sally
822	I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to reduce costs by the end of the year.
822	To this end, I have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings.
822	To make the best decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value proposition.
822	As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.
822	To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end users.
822	Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.
822	Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks.
822	Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.
822	While it was a tough decision, I feel comfortable having made it.
823	Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to our expenses.
823	At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.
823	With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.
823	My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team.
823	In addition, Joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved.
823	The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.
823	After the two hour session, it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, etc. If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been different.
823	But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.
823	That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation.
823	--Sally
824	I made the decision last week to disband the Strategic Initiatives team which reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.
824	The group was led by a director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.
824	The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday afternoon.
824	My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment Team.
824	Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.
824	As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team.
824	I am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.
824	And I believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.
824	The role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users.
824	The "middle-man" role played by the Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.
824	I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort.
825	I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.
825	I will check messages at the end of both business days.
825	My assistant, Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.
825	Since I will be a chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily reachable during the day.
825	I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6.
826	Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of the plan for Q1.
826	As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.
826	I have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach.
826	Beth is in fact in Monterrey, Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.
826	Soon after she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule.
826	After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.
826	With Beth's knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews.
827	Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.
827	Do you want to talk Thursday morning during my commute?
827	I will be out of the office Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.
827	I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas experience!
827	A great time to support her and be around her friends.
827	And nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.
827	With 81 girls on the team, it will be loud, but fun.
827	--Sally
828	An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town: Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions.
828	We have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.
828	While each person on the list has other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.
828	I will review this list continually and update it as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.
828	I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG acquisition.
828	We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.
828	Let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.
828	Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.
828	Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.
828	I followed up with Brent Price (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.
828	Currently, Todd Hall and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.
828	Todd has other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time that Todd would have.
828	Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.
828	She will be returning to Houston from the London office by the end of March.
828	She will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.
828	Todd will stay involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.
828	We will also keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.
828	Shelley is expected to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.
828	I will keep you posted.
829	Approved for Patti Thompson.
829	Sally Beck XMS (Expense Management System) For New Users Session Dates & Times: Location: EB3321
830	Thanks for the update.
830	Good to know that the current due date still looks likely - always give or take a week or so!
830	I have just returned from drill team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!
830	First place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and presentation.
830	Keep me posted on baby news!!
830	--Sally
831	We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very fruitful trip for the team.
831	Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.
831	Klein is super-sized.
831	The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy in the super category.
831	Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size.
831	Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep.
831	Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category.
831	Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.
831	They also won two special judges awards - not given out every time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.
831	They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).
831	The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).
831	The girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.
831	They all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!
831	I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines sometime.
831	I had a lot of fun.
831	The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of the moms who were chaperoning as well.
831	But it was nice to get back to Houston yesterday.
832	Any feedback or interest?
832	Please let me know.
832	--Sally
833	Was this memo just to inform me of this meeting, or did you cc me to invite me to the meeting?
833	I am not available on March 9th from 12:00 to 1:00.
833	Does this meeting pertain only to IT personnel?
833	If so, I will ignore this.
833	If you did want someone from my group to attend, let me know and I will ask an appropriate person to attend.
833	--Sally
834	Please keep this number handy just in case.
834	Thanks.
835	I was out of the office Friday and Monday - just back today.
835	I am having to rearrange some things that Mary was focused on.
835	I will get back with you later today and let you know who the best contact person will be.
835	--Sally
836	Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.
836	I will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by the end of this week.
836	For your planning purposes, I will be available to interview at UT during the week of March 26.
836	Best days for me are Tuesday, March 27 and Thursday, March 29.
836	I can make other days work as well.
836	For the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 or 19th.
836	Hope this helps.
836	If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients on campus.
836	--Sally
837	Please print the attachment for me in color.
837	Thanks.
837	--Sally
838	Thanks for your message.
838	I thought that John did have responsibility for risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.
838	Kristin worked for me for several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!
838	I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.
838	Just give me a call when you are ready to get back together.
838	--Sally
839	Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for Greg's approval.
839	If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for him.
839	Thanks.
839	--Sally
840	Unfortunately, these new dates don't work for me.
840	My children's spring break is next week, March 12-16, I will be out of the office that week on vacation, taking my own daughter to look at colleges!
840	--Sally
841	I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall, the VP that reports to me, on this mailing list.
841	His assistant (Heather Choate) is included in your mailing list.
841	The "Robert L Hall at ET&S" to whom this is addressed is not Bob Hall in Networks who reports to me.
841	You should address this to "Bob Hall" - if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as Bob M Hall/NA/Enron.
841	Thanks.
841	--Sally
842	Still checking kids schedules at home for the 19th.
842	I will let you know tomorrow.
842	--Sally
843	Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended.
843	These are interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in Dallas.
843	Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject.
843	I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so.
843	--Sally
844	I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took the follow up Communications program in 2000.
844	Is this another program that you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the program?
844	Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 1999 and 2000.
844	Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.
844	--Sally
845	I will be out on vacation next week while my kids are on spring break.
845	I will make the next meeting.
845	--Sally
846	Great follow through!
846	Thanks for managing the doorstep process in Mexico so that Max and his team saw that as a plus for them.
846	Perfect approach and outcome.
846	--Sally
847	Yes, I can make March 30th work.
847	I will put that on my calendar.
847	--Sally
848	Cindy had to change lunch to March 30, which conflicts with Bob Shults.
848	I moved Cindy to March 30th- can you try to move my lunch with Bob to March 28th?
848	Thanks.
848	(FYI, CIndy's last names has only "O's" in it - Olson and Bob's last name has only "S's" - no "Z".)
849	Wes' memo finally went out to Sherriff.
849	DPR won't change at this point in time.
849	--Sally
850	I was promoted effective February 1, 2001 to Managing Director of Global Risk Management Operations for Enron Corp. in Houston.
850	In this role I manage all mid and back office services for all commodities markets within Enron's wholesale businesses: Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Europe.
850	I received my BBA from UT-Austin in 1975 and my MBA in 1977.
850	My maiden name while attending school was Sally White.
851	I think that this sounds like a good plan.
851	Since Michelle, Clay and Nadege are still pending on their fulltime offers, this should help us in the cultivation effort.
851	--Sally Enron North America Corp.
852	Thought you might like to see this note from Max on the doorstep review in Monterrey.
852	Beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already.
852	--Sally
853	FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.
853	No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.
853	She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).
853	Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.
853	Just wanted to pass this along.
853	--Sally
854	Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.
854	Please print for me and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my outbox).
854	I will need to review them when I am back.
854	Thanks.
855	I will be out of the office on vacation the week of March 12.
855	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me if you need to reach me while I am out on vacation.
855	Below are the key Operations Contacts for Enron Americas for the week of March 12: Gas Operations Jeff Gossett x37306 Bob Hall x36956 Power Operations Stacey White x31870 DPR Shona Wilson x39123 Chris Abel x33102 MPR Shona Wilson x39123
856	I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring Break.
856	We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges with Meagan.
856	We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.
856	I have planned to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return to work on Thursday and Friday.
856	My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent arises.
856	I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be back at work on Thursday and Friday.
856	In my absence, the following persons are key contacts: Commercialization of Services: James Scribner x39641 Beth Apollo x35014 Enron Americas Operations: Gas: Bob Hall x36956 Power: Stacey White x31870 Enron Global Markets Operations: Brent Price x37647 Enron Industrial Markets Operations: Brenda Herod x35778 Enron Europe Operations: Mike Jordan 7830-34703 Global Services: Beth Apollo x35014
857	Meant to copy you on this note.
857	I will either see you on Thursday next week, or on Monday the 19th.
857	--Sally
858	I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.
858	Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things.
858	Commercialization Efforts- Services: Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.
858	I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase.
858	Jennifer Denney (who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers.
858	Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer.
858	They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.
858	Commercialization Efforts - Consulting: Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers.
858	Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting.
858	Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team.
858	I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.
858	Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company.
858	Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc. There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding work - not necessarily a bad model.
858	Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay.
858	Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way.
858	Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else.
858	I spent some time with him today.
858	I want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure.
858	We are okay for right now.
858	I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside.
858	I will keep you posted.
858	Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing: We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers.
858	We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.
858	Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs.
858	We are researching.
858	To do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.
858	I met with Louise today on this.
858	I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19.
858	Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams.
858	I will get you a draft for your comments.
858	Operational Risk: Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland.
858	Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.
858	I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.
858	(We lost the manager of that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there. Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland.) Operational Risk: Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.
858	End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.
858	We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date.
858	We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale.
858	This number was much larger earlier in the year (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.
858	Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue.
858	Operational Risk: We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week.
858	(This is the review of operational controls and procedures.) Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the end.
858	I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews.
858	We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.
858	He likes the revisions that we have made.
858	Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.
858	Spring Break Plans: My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and the nanny has the week off.
858	We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.
858	Patti has contact numbers for me if needed.
858	I may decide to come back into the office on Thursday and Friday.
858	I will let Patti know when we get back in town.
858	I will either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.
858	See separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.
859	FYI per my longer e:mail update message...
860	Have you heard any more about this?
860	I didn't see it on my calendar.
860	This does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.
860	Maybe Philippe will cancel that.
860	Let me know.
860	Thanks.
860	--Sally
861	I didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included.
861	In case this is going only to Peggy, I thought that I would forward this since she is still on vacation.
861	--Sally
862	Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the response to the RFP went to CMS?
862	Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you have that.
862	You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was only part of the package.
862	I would like to see the whole thing.
862	Thanks.
863	FYI -
864	I will be in New York on business on March 30th.
864	Sorry that I will not be able to attend.
864	The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apollo.
864	However, she will be on vacation next week.
864	Can you give me any info that may be made available?
864	Thanks.
865	Thanks for your note.
865	I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.
865	I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.
865	I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.
865	Please let me know what your start date will be.
865	I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.
865	I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron.
865	--Sally
866	I am so glad that you will be able to interview.
866	I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.
866	--Sally
867	FYI I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.
867	I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.
867	This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.
867	It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.
867	We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.
867	Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.
867	Now that is me.
867	This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.
867	I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.
867	Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.
867	I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one.
868	Thanks for your list.
868	I will add these to our Hot List.
868	Let me know about the A/R.
868	Thanks.
868	Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.
868	--Sally
869	FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.
869	Do you have anything firm from her?
869	--Sally
870	All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.
870	I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.
870	Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.
870	I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.
870	--Sally
871	Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?
871	The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.
871	But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.
871	This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.
871	But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.
871	--Sally
872	FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".
872	If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!
872	- Sally
873	Good response, Bob.
873	Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.
873	--Sally
874	Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.
874	I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.
874	There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.
874	I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?
874	If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).
874	A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.
874	There were many more in attendance.
874	The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.
874	Thanks.
875	Please approve.
876	We will get you back on the official distribution list.
876	For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.
876	--Sally
877	Please approve.
878	FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.
878	We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.
878	Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.
878	This is a good team that knows how to react quickly.
878	--Sally
879	Thanks for your note and resume.
879	I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.
879	He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.
879	I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.
879	Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.
879	--Sally
880	TO: All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.
880	All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.
880	In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.
880	This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.
880	With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.
880	Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.
880	Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.
880	Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.
880	To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM employees and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under company 083E.
880	Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.
880	This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.
880	There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works.
880	Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.
880	This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.
880	Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.
880	The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.
880	Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.
880	Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.
880	You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.
880	We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.
880	If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated: Business Unit HR Contact Phone# EGM David Hill 713/853-4218 EIM Kathy Neal 713/345-7803 EA/Global Services Frank De Jesus 713/345-3662 Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services.
881	Resume attached per my voice mail to you.
881	This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.
881	Any interest?
881	As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend Dave Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.
881	--Sally
882	Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion...
883	Exactly!
883	Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.
883	I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.
883	I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?
883	--Sally
884	Can you print this for me?
884	Thanks.
885	Thanks for putting this together.
885	I will look forward to reading the details later today.
885	--Sally
886	I was at the pre-seasoner opener at Enron Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.
886	It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!
886	-Sally
887	Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion...
888	You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!
888	I suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two months away.
888	I will be glad to handle invitations.
888	I will look for some this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.
888	Cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.
888	I still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.
888	I will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home.
888	--Sally
889	Can you print this for me?
889	Thanks.
890	Please put these dates on my calendar and let Lexi know that at this point the calendar is open and that I will be happy to participate in both the information session and the interviews.
890	Thanks.
891	Please ask Sheri Thomas if this person needs access to EOL applications.
891	I don't recognize the names.
891	The name noted as manager is Loyd Will, who is a commercial employee reporting to Kevin Presto.
891	Thanks.
892	Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.
892	Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.
892	If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.
892	Thanks, Patti x39106
893	I will be in the office the whole week of April 9.
893	I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.
893	--Sally
894	FYI - Let's discuss.
894	--Sally
895	Got your note.
895	It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.
895	Can we delay until then?
895	We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.
895	I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.
895	Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.
895	I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.
895	By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?
895	Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.
895	Hey, you have to start somewhere!
895	I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week.
895	One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.
895	I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.
895	Next week I can give you more info on that.
896	Is this on Vanessa's update list?
896	Are users happy with the results?
897	Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allenand Shona Wilson for the May session.
897	Thanks for the reminder and for yourhelp!
897	--Sally
898	Great idea to run this by Louise.
898	She ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online.
898	I would love to see it, too.
898	Thanks.
898	--Sally
899	Does Vanessa know anything about this?
899	I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.
899	We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.
899	In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.
899	I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.
899	She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.
899	This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.
899	--Sally
900	I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.
900	We will get back with you on this shortly.
900	--Sally
901	Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc. I expect to review a draft by this Friday.
901	Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.
901	We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.
901	Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).
901	We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.
901	If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.
901	Targeted attendees are: Gas Frank Vickers (East) Laura Luce (Central) Barry Tycholiz (West) Derivatives Fred LaGrasta Power Dave Duran Ozzie Pagan Ed Baughman Bruce Shuckley Portland Chris Calger Calgary Ladain Mexico Max Y. When you and I met we discussed most of these names.
901	I added the Calgary guy and Max.
901	I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.
901	They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.
901	We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.
901	Do you want to add any names?
901	If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.
901	--Sally
902	It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.
902	We should probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.
902	Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be James, or you, or Vanessa?
902	Others within our organization that may try to reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's group had been handling, etc. I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as possible contacts.
902	By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.
902	Let me know what you think.
902	--Sally
903	Tight time frame for Mike & co.
903	on metals deliverables.
903	Raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal.
903	Will we divert critical resources from these efforts.
903	--Sally
904	FYI - Let's discuss.
904	--Sally
905	Is this on Vanessa's update list?
905	Are users happy with the results?
906	Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allen and Shona Wilson for the May session.
906	Thanks for the reminder and for your help!
906	--Sally
907	Thanks for the update.
907	I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.
907	She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.
907	She will be closer to this than I. You may want to get her feedback as well.
907	--Sally
908	Please print in color for me.
908	Thanks.
909	In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of Directors on Wednesday.
909	She was very complimentary.
909	I have let Bob know about Louise's praise.
909	Thought that you would like to know as well.
909	--Sally
910	Imagining that for myself, it would not be a pretty site.
910	Was it just a lot of movement, or was there noise as well?
910	--Sally
911	Please print in color for me.
911	Do we have a file set up for these?
911	Thanks.
911	--Sally
912	Is this going to be a shower?
912	If so, I would like to get my own gift for them, if that is okay.
912	Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket?
912	What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my calendar.
912	Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?
912	Thanks.
912	--Sally
913	Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.
913	I don't want to "mass mail" this on Friday.
913	(None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.) Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).
913	They will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked.
913	With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).
913	We can start those next week and finish most next week.
913	I think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we need one.
913	Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it.
913	You and I can discuss that in more detail.
913	Max will be in from Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information.
913	Laura Luce is here today and will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.
913	I have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation.
913	That will leave Portland as the other "out of towner" to schedule.
913	I am planning a trip there the next time that Stacey White heads up there.
913	Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 or 19.
913	We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk team.
913	I would welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.
913	You and I can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow.
913	I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input.
913	Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?
913	--Sally
914	Please print in color for me.
914	Thanks.
915	This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples Energy Board this week.
915	Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).
915	We may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools.
915	--Sally
916	What does "completed" mean?
916	My first request was to give me access to review all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's date.
916	I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my review process.
916	Has this been done?
916	I don't see any new messages that have been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.
916	--Sally
917	Is it lunch or dinner on May 10?
918	Would you like to be included?
918	We will try to start this next week.
918	I will ask Patti to get with you on the details.
918	--Sally
919	I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.
919	Greg and I talked about this today.
919	He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.
919	If he and his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.
919	Thanks for your help.
919	--Sally
920	I have talked with Jeff Gossett, Leslie Reeves and Stacey White to let them know about the Saturday effort and the Sunday meeting.
920	They all will be in town this weekend and will be on call.
920	Their contact numbers are listed below: Home Phone Cell Phone may be long distance Leslie Reeves 281-476-4408 713-907-6554 Stacey White 281-894-0468 281-382-5215 Sally Beck 281-370-8568 713-417-1591 or (Kim Theriot reports to Leslie, so she will talk with Kim. I don't have contact numbers for Kim.)
921	We'll see you the next time.
921	Thanks.
922	Is it lunch or dinner on May 10?
923	I was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to Neiman's.
923	Can you get that list form Vanessa?
923	Thanks.
924	Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.
924	While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.
924	We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.
924	Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.
924	Thanks!
925	We'll see you the next time.
925	Thanks.
926	Please put the 17th meeting on my calendar.
926	I may or may not attend, but want to have that on the calendar just in case.
926	Thanks.
927	The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.
927	Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.
927	Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?
927	I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees): 29th Floor (trading) 67 employees EGM risk, vol.
927	mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 30th Floor (trading) 35 employees EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 31st Floor (trading) 52 employees Power risk, confirms, vol.
927	mgnt., settlements and DPR and MPR teams 32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis 37th Floor 148 employees Gas vol.
927	mgmt., settlements, and global services Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.
927	--Sally
928	I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.
928	While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.
928	They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.
928	Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.
928	I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.
928	While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.
928	I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.
928	This is an FYI more than anything else.
928	--Sally
929	Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.
929	I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.
929	Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.
929	We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.
929	We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc. It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.
929	The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.
930	Patti: I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April.
930	She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that.
930	So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days.
930	I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so no notation on time out of the office.
930	Thanks.
931	Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.
931	We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.
931	I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.
931	We have improved our tickets this year.
931	Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we have some good seats for the year.
931	The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.
931	Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!
931	We will work on the aisle for next year.
931	We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.
931	For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.
931	Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!
931	--Sally
932	Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently married.
932	February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.
932	In honor of Beth's arrival and Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.
932	Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.
932	Let me know if that date will work for you.
933	This date change means that I won't be able to make it to the open house.
933	I will be out of town on April 27.
934	I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor) and on the operations end of floor 32.
934	That would cover everyone pretty well.
934	Thanks.
934	--Sally
935	I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.
935	We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.
935	With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.
935	We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.
935	Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.
935	I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday.
936	Good idea.
936	Is there a way to monitor usage of this folder is insure that everyone has read and complied with your message?
937	In re-reading this, I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution list.
937	He is the only one from Brent's team included.
937	Do you want to copy Brent as well, or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by Susie Ayala.
937	Either way, you may want to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.
937	What about Georgeanne Hodges?
937	Should she be notified as well?
937	You may also want to copy Wes as an FYI.
937	Thanks.
938	Here is another one...
939	Memo on floor meetings, plus my reply to Greg and Philippe.
940	According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up in the air.
940	Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.
940	My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.
940	Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?
940	Thanks.
940	--Sally
941	Back on the calendar this afternoon with Andy Zipper to get his comments on the presentation - should be able to get you and John a copy following that meeting.
942	Here is another one...
943	This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space in the new building.
943	You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns.
943	I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space planning details.
943	I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will be reporting to you.
943	I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am.
943	--Sally
944	This will be an important meeting for me to attend.
944	Let me know when this gets scheduled.
944	Thanks.
945	Memo on floor meetings, plus my reply to Greg and Philippe.
946	I am taking Good Friday as my discretionary holiday for the year.
946	I will be in Austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at UT, plus a look at dorms.
946	Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin.
946	We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be reviewing those tomorrow in Austin.
946	I am e:mailing you a current draft version, although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed.
946	I am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size.
946	I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a presentation.
947	Thanks for following up on this.
947	We will incorporate you numbers for offices and spots in the Tower.
948	Here is final presentation.
948	I worked with Fred and Stephen this morning to make final changes.
948	--Sally
949	Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.
949	Thanks.
949	--Sally
950	I will meet with Kim this afternoon on her comments on ConfirmLogic.
950	Bottom line, no sign off from Kim at this point.
950	Thought you might want to know.
950	--Sally
951	I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you.
951	I have only read Kim's e-mail - I will talk with her later today.
951	--Sally
952	Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.
952	Thanks.
952	--Sally
953	I will need a rental car in Oklahoma - looks like National is the one to use.
953	Thanks.
953	--Sally
954	Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note to say hello.
954	Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but it is busy here!
954	Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.
954	All of these of course with top priority!
954	I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.
954	She has already made a very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations side.
954	How is life treating you?
954	I know that their is a lot going on in the London office, as well.
954	How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office been?
954	Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?
954	Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding their baby.
954	Hope that all is well with you.
954	--Sally
955	I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister Jane and her husband, Homer and Karen, Sarah in Austin (whose kids are independently dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.
955	I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.
955	The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.
955	I will try to catch David and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.
955	Thanks for these.
955	I will do invitations this weekend.
955	Do you have the address for Josephine's House?
955	And do we have a time?
955	--Sally
956	Thought you'd like to know.
956	--Sally
957	Thought you'd like to know.
957	--Sally
958	Congratulations on the birth of Emma.
958	I hope that everyone is doing well.
958	Enjoy your time off and the opportunity to hold and hug that new baby.
958	I will look forward to seeing pictures the next time that we get together.
958	--Sally
959	As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates: Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's arrival, etc. I will also have details of resource needs.
959	We can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives.
959	I will welcome your comments on the timeline.
959	--Sally
960	Latest update - FYI
961	I will be out of town on Thursday.
961	I think that it would be great if you could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.
961	If you can make it, please try to attend.
961	And I would love to have a voice mail message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.
961	Thanks.
962	The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning.
962	Highlights from last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well.
962	Let me know if anything has been left off the list.
962	--Sally
963	I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.
963	I don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend.
963	I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their schedules.
963	I will let you know later who will attend.
963	I will be out of the office that day.
963	--sally
964	Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.
964	I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues".
964	My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need.
964	A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum.
964	--Sally
965	FYI - I need to talk with Shona tomorrow to get a read on what Rick wants here.
965	Do you have any ideas given your on-going conversations with David Port?
965	--Sally
966	Latest update - FYI
967	I have put this meeting on my calendar.
967	You don't need to forward to anyone else.
967	Chantelle should handle that for Brent's EGM team.
967	Thanks.
968	I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.
968	I have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his Tueday meeting with Louise.
968	I will share these items with you as I get them checked off my list this afternoon.
968	--Sally
969	Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services.
969	Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.
969	The purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.
969	I have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.
969	Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone.
969	Thought that you might be interested.
969	Open the attachment to the e-mail below.
969	This way you will know more of the details of our efforts each week.
969	--Sally
970	Here is Rick's response - sounds more like a concern on his part on losing people and some of their reasons cited for leaving.
970	Do you know who has left?
971	Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.
971	Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.
971	This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.
971	Next steps: Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?) Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot) Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting)
972	FYI
973	I enjoyed lunch, too.
973	Glad you included Kristin.
973	When do Jo and the kids leave for England?
973	We should try to have lunch with our gangs before then.
973	Let me know.
973	--Sally
974	Thanks for the invitation.
974	I will be out of town April 25 through 27, so unfortunately I will have to miss the game.
974	--Sally
975	Please put this on my calendar.
975	Thanks.
976	Glad you followed up - I don't know why you would have been deleted, but I am glad that is straightened out.
976	I will look for the feedback form via e-mail.
976	Thanks.
977	Thanks for your note.
977	I am glad that you liked the pictures.
977	We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.
977	If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.
977	I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.
977	Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast.
977	Whatever works for you will be great, though.
977	I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.
977	Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.
977	My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.
977	She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.
977	I know that we will have a good time catching up.
978	We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will include employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.
978	You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.
978	It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.
978	While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.
978	I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.
978	Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.
978	Thanks.
979	Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.
979	At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.
979	On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.
979	Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.
979	The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.
979	(We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.
979	I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.
979	My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.
979	In that meeting we review director level and above.
979	Rick has not set the date for that meeting.
980	I always like to heart good news.
980	I can't say that I have been deluged with examples since that meeting in January.
980	I will ask Patti to set up a meeting sometime this week for us to get together.
980	--Sally
981	I can't say that this will make me sad to lose this job.
981	Enjoy it!
981	--Sally
982	I don't recall making this request.
982	Who did you hear this from?
982	Maybe that person could shed light on this for both of us.
982	There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn't match the organizational name that is used for your group.
982	I wonder if that is where this is coming from?
982	Norma (whose last name I don't know) who works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.
982	The RC name that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously seem to relate to your team.
982	Question was whether or not this RC reported in through Operations.
982	When I asked Norma to read me the names of employees in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.
982	I told her that we had not used the term "IBS" in a while.
982	Norma asked if the RC name should be consistent with the organizational name of the group.
982	I said that makes sense and she said she would follow up on that.
982	But that should have been a name change, not the opening of a new cost center.
982	See if any of this info gets us back on the right track.
982	--Sally
983	I will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 11th.
983	If you join us for discussions on VP's, we will review Brent Price, Bob Hall, Peggy Hedstrom and Beth Apollo.
983	If you want to sit in on review of senior directors, that would pick up Leslie Reeves, James Scribner, Brenda Herod, Kevin Sweeney and Sheila Glover.
983	--Sally
984	Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.
984	At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.
984	I understand from Ted Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.
984	You might check with Lexi Elliot (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.
984	If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could help in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.
984	My last conversation with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.
984	--Sally
985	On PRC: In the next few days, I will be able to give Tina an idea on the time when we will start Senior Directors in the June 11th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing.
985	Contracts: I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.
985	They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day.
985	(Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.) I will keep you posted.
985	I believe that these new contracts will be well received.
985	Q2 Goals: Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.
985	--Sally
986	FYI ---
987	Thanks for copying me on Michael Brown's note.
987	Brenda Herod flew to London last night and should be in the London office today.
987	I am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this.
987	She and I visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in London for the pulp and paper effort.
987	So as to not steal her thunder, it will suffice to say that I am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing EGM model.
987	--Sally
988	Please approve this request.
988	Brent Price is my direct report and is responsible for the RC's included in this request.
988	Thanks.
988	--Sally Beck
989	I have put the staff meeting referenced at the bottom of John's message on my calendar.
989	Please check with Kim on the location and as to whether or not future dates are set.
989	Also, please check to see if date for offsite has been set.
989	We are trying to schedule a vacation, and it would help to know the dates of the offsite.
989	Thanks.
990	FYI -
991	Please see if you can get this to print so that I get all of the info.
991	I tried it 100 times on Friday and could only one page to print, which did not include all of the information.
991	Thanks.
991	NEED THIS TODAY.
992	You are welcome to attend any of these.
992	In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.
992	Do get with Jeff and Stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.
992	PATTI: Please add Beth to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.
992	Thanks.
993	We are planning a meeting with the teams lead by Meredith, Mark Evans and Mary Lynne Ruffner this afternoon - you should be getting information from Meredith shortly with time and location.
993	During that meeting we will clarify this memo for everyone.
993	--Sally
994	At the end of my 3:00 meeting with Philippe and Greg today I will get clarification about the international travel.
994	It is hard for me to believe that Philippe or Beth Perlman or Greg Piper will fly coach to London.
994	I will keep you posted.
994	-Sally
995	FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.
995	I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.
995	This may be part of your process.
995	If not, it probably should be incorporated.
995	Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.
995	Let me know if you need and help or support from me.
995	Hope that all is well.
995	--Sally
996	Thanks for copying me on this note.
996	I have sent a suggestion to Sheri and asked her to respond to Frank Hayden.
996	--Sally
997	Good solution - and you are right, this falls under our normal Educational Assistance program.
997	Thanks for the update.
997	--Sally
998	The name that I couldn't remember when we spoke yesterday if Geoffrey Mann - Americas CEO.
998	Accompanying him will be Jim Martino from the Austin office.
998	They will be here at 9:00 and I will have them come to the 33rd floor and I will meet with them for a few minutes.
998	Then I can call you and walk them to wherever you are going to meet with them.
998	Again, thanks for making this work for your schedule.
998	Business decisions about what Viviance can provide for you are clearly yours.
998	I do appreciate your willingness to give them your time and a fair "audience".
998	I know that my sister is very bullish on the quality of the product that they deliver.
999	I look forward to seeing you again on Thursday morning and to meeting Mr. Mann.
999	You will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby.
999	Usually, the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here.
999	My extention is 35926.
999	You will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 33rd floor.
999	There is a reception area on 33.
999	I will meet you there.
999	--Sally Beck
1000	Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.
1000	We can talk about how the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.
1000	We will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.
1000	--Sally
1001	Thanks for joining us for dinner last week.
1001	It was good to see you again as well.
1001	I hope that your temporary move to Houston goes smoothly.
1001	Please call me with a contact number for you this summer.
1001	We can get together while you are in town for your summer internship.
1001	--Sally
1002	I know that the timing on choosing these interns was short.
1002	Thanks for responding back to Jana so quickly.
1002	And now most of them will be here next Monday!
1002	Please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a location, phone and computer (with necessary access granted) for these interns.
1002	I want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introduction to working at Enron.
1002	This list excludes those that will assigned to EGM under Brent Price and his team.
1002	As soon as I get an updated list from Jana, I will schedule a meeting for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a success this summer.
1002	All ideas will be welcome, so get creative before coming to the meeting.
1002	Thanks.
1002	--Sally
1003	I want to keep track of summer interns.
1003	Please make me a desk file.
1003	This list is missing summer interns under Brent.
1003	I have asked Jana to send me an updated list.
1003	I have also sent her a message letting her know that Sheri Thomas now reports into Andy Zipper and that she needs to communicate with Sheri and Andy directly regarding Greg Carlson's internship.
1003	Also, did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts?
1003	Can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us?
1003	I would like to review them.
1003	I also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them.
1003	Please check with the listed supervisor on Jana's list.
1003	If one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor, please get that name.
1003	Thanks.
1003	-Sally
1004	FYI
1005	Could I be included in these update meetings?
1005	Rather than read the material after the fact and have you review it with me separately, it seems that it would make sense for me to be included in the update meeting that you hold with Rick.
1005	Assuming that Rick is comfortable with that, can we do that going forward?
1005	If all agree, please ask your assistant to let me know if a date has already been set for the next update.
1005	Thanks.
1005	.
1006	Please print atttachment for me.
1006	Thanks.
1007	Here are the two for Brent.
1007	Please get copies of resumes from Jana.
1007	Please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns.
1007	Include Brent as well.
1007	Thanks.
1007	(thirty minutes will be fine)
1008	Let's talk about this one.
1008	_sally
1009	Thanks for your note.
1009	I have sent a message to Beth Apollo, who is James' supervisor.
1009	Beth is out for the next two days, and will return to the office on Wednesday.
1009	I will make sure that Beth and James make a point of talking with you about this opportunity.
1009	--Sally
1010	You may want to consider her.
1010	We can discuss.
1010	--Sally
1011	I regret that I will miss the first Global Accounting Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 15.
1011	I am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in Houston for Amanda's piano recital.
1011	I will be in attendance at the next two meetings in May - the 22nd CAO Meeting and the 29th Steering Committee Meeting.
1012	I will be out of the office on Tuesday, May 15.
1012	I am taking a vacation day while my parents will be in town for my daughter's piano recital.
1012	Patti (x39106) has cell and home numbers where I can be reached.
1012	I will be back in the office on Wednesday, May 16.
1013	Please print attachment in color.
1013	Also print all other recent e:mails from Mechelle.
1013	Thanks.
1014	It was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in Houston.
1014	You arrived with a some good advance "press" from Cindy, all of which was well founded.
1014	I am glad that your meeting with Tom was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between Enron's needs and Vivance's offerings.
1014	I know that Cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.
1014	I have e-mailed JIm Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.
1014	While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.
1014	Let me know when you will be back in Houston.
1014	If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.
1014	--Sally
1015	Here is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.
1015	I told Sharron that you would be in town and she said that you (and Anna) would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day.
1015	FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adams Mark Hotel.
1015	This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or cab.
1015	I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.
1015	My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.
1015	Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.
1015	--Sally
1016	June 12 works well for me.
1016	It is likely that we will be on vacation on Friday, June 22.
1016	My husband is finalizing airline reservations today, and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on Friday, June 22 rather than Saturday, June 23.
1016	--Sally
1017	I remember you well, Christine, from the recruiting process.
1017	I would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at Enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group.
1017	By copy of this memo, I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together.
1017	I look forward to seeing you.
1017	--Sally
1018	Peggy: I will be at the meeting at 12:00, but will need to leave around 12:30 for a meeting with someone from London.
1018	Our schedules wouldn't allow for any other time for us to get together, and I have some critical things to review regarding London.
1018	--Sally
1019	Thanks for the details on the flowers.
1019	That should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer.
1019	David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called.
1019	Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the time.
1019	We really enjoyed your visit as well!
1019	Thanks for supporting Amanda in her musical efforts.
1019	--Sally
1020	We need to talk.
1021	Do you want my help in preparing something for Paul?
1021	Would you like me to go with you when you meet with Paul?
1022	Can you print the attachment for me?
1022	Thanks.
1023	The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).
1023	Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.
1023	Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.
1023	As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.
1023	After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.
1023	The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30.
1024	What do we do with this?
1024	I logged in, but couldn't tell what to do.
1024	--Sally
1025	I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.
1025	I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.
1025	With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.
1025	One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.
1025	I may have met Savita once in passing.
1025	I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.
1025	Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.
1025	I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.
1025	I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.
1025	--Sally
1026	Can you print attachment for me?
1026	Thanks.
1027	The deadline has been extended by HR until Tuesday, so that many of us can work on these reviews over the weekend.
1027	You should see more responses early next week.
1027	--Sally
1028	Informational for me, or do you want me to attend?
1028	If you don't want me to attend, would you like for me to review the presentation that you plan to give?
1028	--Sally
1029	My first and second choices on speaking engagements are listed below: 1st choice MG906 Wed, July 11 Who Moved My Cheese?
1029	2nd choice MG909 Fri., July 13 Leading Your Firm Through Change Frank and Hector have been on point for further participation in the conference and would be best to visit with about use of other passes to the conference.
1029	Wes Colwell has co-sponsored our involvement in this conference.
1029	Are the four passes intended to cover his group, too?
1029	--Sally
1030	Glad that the two of you could make the trip to Houston this week.
1030	Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.
1030	I Anna, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.
1030	Mike, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London.
1030	I enjoyed the shopping and dinner.
1030	--Sally
1031	Patti is sending you my slides for the offsite - I finally got out of meetings long enough to review them!
1031	There will be four parts to the Mid/Back Office hour and a half on the agenda: Global Risk Management Operations - Overview of Services (Beck providing slides) IT Systems - Overview and Organization (Perlman providing slides) ) CommodityLogic Modules (Gros providing slides) Commercialization Effort (the three of us are working on a few slides - to come later today)
1032	Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.
1032	She is formating info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.
1032	(Patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.) I think that you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.
1032	We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.
1032	Thanks, Tina.
1032	--Sally
1033	There is another Senior Director in London in Operations - Anna McAndrew.
1033	She was just joined Enron in April, and I was unsure of her title.
1033	Confirmed that this morning.
1034	What is lily of the valley?
1034	I don't know.
1034	Would it add anything special to the coursage?
1034	If so, I would be glad to spring for it.
1034	I just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call.
1034	Could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $60?
1034	Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary.
1034	White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.
1034	We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.
1034	You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.
1034	I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!
1034	(I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally
1035	Please put this date on my calendar and let Lexi know that I will be glad to attend.
1035	Thanks.
1036	Please print
1037	Evan has close to 300 people reporting to him.
1037	The largest segment is the service management team.
1037	My understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers.
1037	We will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale, and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions.
1037	I don't think we are in danger of getting Mark back.
1037	--Sally
1038	Kristin, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT recruiting.
1038	The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work.
1038	My assistant is Patti Thompson (x39106) and Rick's assistant is Sharron Westbrook.
1038	By copy of this note, I will ask Patti to coordinate with Sharron and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that Rick and I could get with you.
1038	-Sally
1039	Please coordinate with Sharron on Rick's schedule and get back with Kristin to set up a meeting.
1039	Thanks.
1039	--Sally
1040	Please print color versions of attachments, along with black and white of Anna's cover note.
1040	Thanks.
1041	Please print attachment for me.
1041	Thanks.
1042	FYI
1043	I printed copies of this resume the day that I received it from you.
1043	I met with Beth Perlman that day and gave her the resume in person.
1043	I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.
1043	I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy Robert Jones on this resume.
1043	Robert heads up HR for Enron Net Works.
1043	Feel free to give Beth, Philippe and Robert a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.
1043	--Sally
1044	What do you think?
1044	I have never been crazy about the Commercial Support tag myself.
1044	Do you like professional services?
1044	Or do you have another suggestion.
1044	Please send me your comments within the next day or so.
1044	I would like to get back to David Oxley soon.
1044	Thanks.
1044	--Sally
1045	Got your note.
1045	I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.
1045	Professional Services sounds fine to me.
1045	I have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments - Bob Hall, Brent Price, Beth Apollo and Peggy Hedstrom.
1045	I should hear back from them today, and I will pass along any pertinent comments.
1045	Thanks.
1045	--Sally
1046	Greg Piper and Robert Jones are aware that I will be on vacation on the date of the PRC meeting.
1046	--Sally
1047	Thanks.
1047	We will add Greg to the list and will get back with him on details.
1047	-Sally
1048	Sorry to hear about your grandmother.
1048	Funerals, oddly enough, seem to create opportunities to catch up with other family members.
1048	Nice to see everyone, you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together.
1048	I will talk with you soon.
1048	--Sally
1049	We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.
1049	We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dave Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (Evan Hughes) under EES.
1049	Final decision expected this week.
1049	--Sally
1050	Bob Hall says Professional Services is fine - "change is good", as he said.
1050	Brent's other suggestions are below.
1050	I agree with you - simply changing the label doesn't do a whole lot.
1050	Actions will speak louder than words.
1050	--Sally
1051	Thanks for the follow up.
1051	--sally
1052	We will be in Telluride the last week in June for vacation.
1052	Any suggestions on where we should eat?
1052	Think 17, 12 and 3 (children's ages).
1052	Thanks!
1052	--Sally
1053	FYI - as we get closer to quarter end, it may help your DPR team to know about any pending deals that could be done close to quarter end.
1053	--Sally
1054	As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.
1054	To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers, and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.
1054	We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.
1054	Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.
1054	Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.
1054	--Sally (x35926)
1055	I understand from Greg that he got a little more direction from Paul about the Calpine meeting that has been moved to Thursday morning.
1055	Please send Beth Perlman and me a copy of the revised draft of the meeting document that you are preparing, in addition to Tom.
1055	Thanks.
1056	Another opinion.
1056	I read Barry's response from EBS.
1056	Not a lot of overwhelming sentiment for Professional Services.
1056	Since this in only a term used in the PRC process, I don't know that a name change at this point would make much of a difference.
1056	Let me know is decided.
1056	--Sally
1057	I didn't have an opening that looked quite right for Dan's experiece.
1057	I have, however, given has resume to Tom Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with Beth Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.
1057	In this effort, it is likely that Tom will to put together a marketing team.
1057	I suggested that he consider Dan for one of those positions.
1058	FYI - I will fill you in on the meeting this afternoon and will get you a copy of whatever we review.
1058	--Sally
1059	FYI
1060	Thanks so much for your note.
1060	I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under Enron Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.
1060	The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!
1060	Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.
1060	CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.
1060	I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.
1060	While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.
1060	My thoughts are with you and your family.
1060	--Sally
1061	Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each.
1061	The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.
1061	The schedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting.
1061	If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us.
1061	There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule.
1061	One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.
1061	I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours..
1061	Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.
1061	In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00.
1061	I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for Ken Lay.
1061	Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us.
1061	I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared.
1061	Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.
1061	We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.
1061	That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs.
1061	We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes.
1061	I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW.
1061	If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?).
1061	I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us.
1061	We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects.
1061	Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussion.
1061	A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.
1061	We will have a straw man for discussion on that.
1061	--Sally
1062	This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.
1062	All of these would be IT applications support.
1062	I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.
1062	Thanks.
1062	--Sally
1063	Anthony: It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from Rob.
1063	Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to Dan Leff and Wade Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.
1063	This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.
1063	Jenny: Can Ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.
1063	We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, Beth Apollo, and Anthony by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.
1063	Thanks.
1063	--Sally
1064	Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.
1064	I would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees.
1064	Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and ENW agree upon.
1064	While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still have concerns about this on a lot of levels.
1064	Frankly, the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the EOL relationship.
1064	If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then whenever John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly.
1064	Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired!
1064	I also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement.
1064	I will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people.
1064	The guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of EA in mind.
1064	They work hard to insure success for EA.
1064	That is what John and Louise should want.
1064	Push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.
1064	It is kind of ironic.
1064	I think that Enron is pleased with how I've managed operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for Enron.
1064	I have some really good people who are very motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc. We had to work hard to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.
1064	So how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had.
1064	EES is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full.
1064	And now I have been asked to help correct that.
1064	Makes you kind of wonder...
1064	I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.
1064	When I first took this role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice.
1064	A component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered.
1064	We can continue to improve on this, but going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.
1064	--Sally
1065	I may have zapped some of these updates from John since he has started this.
1065	May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with Louise to have all of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to John starting this update process - as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to improve performance and reliability.
1065	Can one of you get all of these updates?
1065	Thanks.
1065	--Sally
1066	Thanks for the updates.
1066	When we had the problem with the server resynchronization, did someone from the Infrastructure team alert you ahead of time that they were going to do this during normal business hours, or did you have to be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand.
1066	Let me know.
1066	Thanks.
1066	--Sally
1067	If I were you, I would talk to Wanda and let her know that Ken is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.
1067	We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with Ken.
1067	Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with Wanda, and I will be glad to.
1067	Might be a good idea to send a note to Dave, Janet and Dan stating that legal has named Wanda as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that Ken must be fully involved - and that you have asked Wanda to make that part of her responsibility.
1067	Copy Wanda on the note.
1067	--Sally
1068	These are Monday dates.
1068	With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.
1068	Unfortunately, neither date works for me.
1068	I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.
1068	The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.
1068	And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.
1068	As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.
1068	If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!
1068	--Sally
1069	Always nice to see positive things.
1069	Thought I'd share this with you.
1069	--Sally
1070	Thanks for the note and your words of encouragement.
1070	It is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for Enron.
1070	I appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that.
1070	--Sally
1071	Please put on my calendar.
1071	Thanks.
1072	Wednesday is out for me, but Thursday, October 18 and Friday, October 19 both work.
1072	I will tentatively hold both days until I hear back from you.
1072	Thanks.
1072	--Sally Also, great job on organizing the CHF event.
1072	I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the people I met and the discussion that we had have certainly created a lot of food for thought.
1072	I am in the midst of budgets this week, but will check with you next week on getting our boys together.
1073	Thanks.
1073	Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.
1073	Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.
1073	What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.
1073	My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.
1073	If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.
1073	Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.
1073	The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.
1073	It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.
1073	I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .
1073	Thanks.
1073	--Sally
1074	Thought I'd pass this comment along from Beverly!
1074	--Sally
1075	John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately occur rather frequently.
1075	When he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours.
1075	Here is his response.
1075	I bring this to your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.
1075	I know that everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated.
1075	I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch EOL.
1075	Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems?
1075	Because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is impaired.
1075	Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.
1075	Thanks.
1075	--Sally
1076	FYI -Sally
1077	Thanks for keeping me posted.
1077	--Sally
1078	Rick: Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk.
1078	We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involved in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives.
1078	There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.
1078	Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's businesses.
1078	Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide?
1078	I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complementing, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being piloted in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA audits, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other Thursday with you and Rick Causey.
1078	Before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cover this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo.
1078	I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project.
1078	The creation of a framework for quantifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels.
1078	As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/functional area outside RAC.
1078	The cross-functional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatFinally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being addressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure that information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate and efficiently handled.
1078	As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spanning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.
1078	We have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, resource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).
1078	A team of stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for final input.
1078	My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for Debbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline.
1078	Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we review the details with you, I think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the Wanda's list.
1078	We can certainly update the cross-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point.
1078	Sally
1079	Thanks, Rosalee.
1079	I have forwarded the information to Jenny Rub with our IT infrastructure group.
1079	--Sally
1080	My hot buttons for operations would be recruiting, career development and resource planning.
1080	Before I simply make assignments, let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas.
1080	My staff meeting will be tomorrow at 9:00.
1080	I will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that I mentioned.
1080	--Sally
1081	Here it is...

1082	Please print for Sally.
1082	Thanks, Christina
1083	Please give to Mike ASAP for meeting with Sally that's occuring NOW...
1083	Thanks, Christina
1084	Thanks for your note.
1084	I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!
1084	Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.
1084	Hope that 2nd year is going well.
1084	I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with Dean May and the Enron scholarship winners later in October.
1084	--Sally
1085	Can you get me a color copy of this document?
1085	Thanks.
1086	Can I get a color copy printed?
1086	Thanks.
1086	--Sally
1087	Please check to see which reports will be reviewed in this meeting.
1087	I have forwarded a few to you today to have printed in color.
1087	If there are some reports to be reviewed that we don't have, can you get copies of those for me?
1087	I want to take a look at them before the Oct. 10th meeting.
1087	Thanks.
1087	--Sally
1088	I have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air!
1088	Congratulations on your new role.
1088	With your most recent experience in Investor Relations, I know that you will do a great job in communicating with Enron's Board.
1088	Best of luck in your new role.
1088	--Sally
1089	When: Friday, October 5, 2001 1:30 PM-2:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
1089	rescheduled from Oct. 1, 2001 to Oct. 5 2001 same time and location (different date)
1090	Our invitation to all Analysts and Associates to attend our meeting paid off with at least one!

1091	The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services: Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.
1091	We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.
1091	We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.
1091	Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.
1091	Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget: Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.
1091	Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.
1091	Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the 2002 budget as well.
1091	The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.
1091	Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.
1091	For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.
1091	The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.
1091	Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.
1091	In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.
1091	If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them, please call one of us.

1092	I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for Houston's Future.
1092	I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.
1092	I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the Houston community.
1092	I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between now and then.
1092	I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps through my association with the Center.
1092	Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.
1092	--Sally Beck
1093	Thanks, too, for getting my name in front of Ken!
1093	--Sally
1094	Thanks, Joannie.
1094	Sorry I didn't see it the first time around!
1094	--Sally
1095	A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.
1095	Please read this communication in detail.
1095	Purpose: Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.
1095	A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.
1095	Location: Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.
1095	Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.
1095	Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.
1095	Timing.
1095	Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.
1095	The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.
1095	Testing.
1095	Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.
1095	Telephones.
1095	Only regular phones will be available.
1095	For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.
1095	Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
1095	Other supplies.
1095	The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.
1095	If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.
1095	Limited Access.
1095	The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.
1095	To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.
1095	Escalation Procedures.
1095	The plan will be as follows: I. During regular business hours A. Announcement.
1095	You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.
1095	-OR- B. No Announcement.
1095	If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.
1095	II.
1095	After hours For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.
1095	E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.
1096	SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.
1096	I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.
1096	I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30.
1096	I hope that you will be able to attend.
1096	I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting.
1096	I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.
1096	I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.
1096	Sally
1097	In a word - no.
1097	ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.
1097	There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.
1097	The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.
1097	It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.
1097	These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.
1097	Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.
1097	When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.
1097	Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.
1097	--Sally
1098	Kevin, thanks for getting back to me with names so promptly.
1098	Everyone on the list will be an asset on this effort.
1098	--Sally
1099	Best day is October 26.
1099	Could make October 25 work.
1099	October 24 and November 1 will not work for me.
1099	--Sally Beck
1100	Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.
1100	It was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.
1100	All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!
1100	A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.
1100	So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.
1100	If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.
1100	Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.
1100	If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.
1100	Golf on Monday, November 19?
1100	Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.
1100	If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.
1100	Did I mention that David is in charge of this tournament?
1100	I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.
1100	Meagan and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.
1100	I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.
1100	I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical comes up.
1100	I will be back in the office on Tuesday.
1100	Have a great weekend!
1100	--Sally
1101	Thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas.
1101	I agree that some sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the company and to the employees.
1101	I have another week or so of living the 2002 budgets, and then I will be able to do other things!
1101	I am saving your note, and will get in touch with you after that to talk about your ideas in more detail.
1101	I am copying my assistant on this note so that she can schedule a time for us to get together.
1101	--Sally
1102	This is the memo crafted by Andrew Parsons that was sent to the traders last week regarding their back-up spots on the 30th floor of ECN during the remainder of the construction in ECS.
1102	You and Greg were copied on the original send of this memo.
1102	--Sally
1103	We would like to honor you as recepients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships at a dinner in Austin on Tuesday, October 16 at The Josephine House at 7:00 pm.
1103	.
1103	Dean May and other members of the staff and faculty of the McComb Business School will be in attendance, as well as several of us from Enron.
1103	We would like to include your spouse, where applicable.
1103	Please send me a return e-mail to let me know if you will be available on October 16.
1103	As soon as I hear back from you, we will finalize details and e-mail an invitation to you with appropriate details.
1103	Feel free to call me as well, if you have any questions.
1103	My direct number at Enron is 713-853-5926 and my home number (best after 7:30 pm) is 281-370-8568.
1103	--Sally
1104	We are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.
1104	We have booked The Josephine House once again.
1104	I wanted to confirm several details with you.
1104	1) Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm --Do these times work for you?
1104	2) Last year's invitees from UT included the following: Associate Dean Philip Zerrillo philip.zerrillo@bus.utexas.edu Assistant Dean Britt Freund brittf@mail.utexas.edu Dr. George Gau ggau@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Beverly Hadaway hadawayb@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Linda Golden mkllg@mail.utexas.edu Mr. Eloy Garcia eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?
1104	If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.
1104	I will update you later in the week with the list of Enron attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.
1104	I look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.
1104	I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for Enron and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.
1104	Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.
1104	Sally White Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC
1105	Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.
1105	One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.
1105	I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).
1105	Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.
1105	I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!
1105	You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.
1105	Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.
1105	Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.
1105	Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).
1105	Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.
1105	Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.
1105	Checking the list of "more senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.
1105	Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.
1105	She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.
1105	Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?
1105	--Sally
1106	I am glad that you will be able to join us.
1106	Yes, we are planning on cocktails first and then dinner.
1106	I am waiting for a response back from Dean May to confirm the time - tentatively set for 7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner.
1106	We can probably either officially slip this schedule back by a half hour to 7:30 and 8:00, or unofficially stretch this to work with your schedule.
1106	We would be happy to have your husband join us as well.
1106	Let me know whether to expect one or both of you.
1106	--Sally
1107	McKinsey: I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.
1107	Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.
1107	Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.
1107	What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.
1107	We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.
1107	Staff Meeting Attendees: Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?
1107	Does he know about it for this week?
1107	Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?
1107	We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.
1107	Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.
1107	Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.
1107	(FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC. Creates a bit of a bumpy start. Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,. I can share those with you. Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.) Budgets: After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?
1107	That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.
1107	Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.
1107	I have some ideas on how we might get there.
1107	Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.
1107	--Sally
1108	I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.
1108	For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.
1108	I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.
1108	I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.
1108	We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.
1108	We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.
1108	Friday, October 12 2:00 to 3:00 PM Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works, LLC
1109	That would be great if you have time.
1109	If you run out of time, we can wing it in lavendar.
1109	Thanks.
1109	--Sally
1110	I have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th.
1110	My intent had been to join Rick's meeting at the halfway point at 2:30 under the original schedule.
1110	With the time change of Rick's meeting to a 1:30 start, I will now miss his meeting.
1110	Please let him know that I will be in the budget review meeting with EGM during that time period.
1110	Thanks.
1110	--Sally
1111	Can the travel agency send these things to you?
1111	--Sally
1112	Can you keep a running list of attendees and RSVP's?
1112	Thanks.
1113	Absolutely, we would enjoy having Angela Dorsey join us for dinner.
1113	I am glad that you made the suggestion.
1113	Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.
1113	Thanks for the congratulations.
1113	Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.
1113	I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.
1113	--Sally
1114	Attached is an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by Enron to honor this year's recipients of the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.
1114	This is Enron's third year to award scholarships to three outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program.
1114	One of the highlights to those of us involved from Enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students.
1114	Dean May will be in attendance, as well as other faculty members from the business school, including Ehud Ronn, Director of UT's Center for Energy Finance and Research.
1114	Since each of you will be in Austin to interview on campus on Tuesday, or will be arriving Tuesday to interview on Wednesday, I hope that you will be able to join us at The Josephine House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.
1114	Please RSVP to me by Friday.
1114	I will send you a complete list of attendees on Monday.
1114	Call me if you have any questions.
1114	--Sally
1115	Through Friday, October 12 at 5:00 pm I will be in ECN 2748.
1115	I will move to ECS over the weekend, so if you do not get my packet to me before 5:00 on Friday, please call my assistant (Christina Valdez x39106) to get my new location for Monday.
1116	What is it that Oxley is looking for in the ENW PRC report that you mentioned?
1117	Is this the staff meeting for next Thursday, October 18th?
1117	I will be here that day.
1117	--Sally
1118	Per my voice mail, Wanda is still the lead on this initiative.
1118	From our conversation in your office, I had assumed that this would change.
1118	Apparently has not to date.
1118	Rick Buy and I are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour.
1118	My intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives.
1118	He has added Wanda, Debbie Brackett, Bill Bradford and David Port to the tomorrow's meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that Rick and I are sponsoring.
1118	Unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first topic, I doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk.
1118	--Sally
1119	The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.
1119	Just FYI.
1119	I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.
1119	I will pass those along to Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.
1119	Bowen has already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.
1119	Kevin reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.
1119	I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.
1119	--Sally
1120	Our meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.
1120	Ray Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with Kevin Sweeney - Ray just initiated that meeting himself with Kevin one day last week, spur of the moment.
1120	But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.
1120	I have been working with Kent Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.
1120	I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.
1120	--Sally
1121	What's the story on this one?
1121	Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?
1121	How soon can we have answers?
1121	Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).
1121	I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.
1121	Thanks.
1121	--Sally
1122	Thanks for forwarding the note to me.
1122	I have asked Shona and Brent to get back with me on answers to your questions.
1122	Shona's team did move this weekend to ECS (as did I), and I am not sure how much additional chaos this has added to her life for today!
1122	I will follow up with her mid -afternoon on details.
1122	I agree with you that this serves as a good case study - underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead of continuing to document problems.
1122	By definition, to arrive at complete and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to RisktRAC, we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets.
1122	--Sally
1123	Probably should have sent this to you as well as Brent.
1123	--Sally
1124	The following individuals from The University of Texas at Austin have agreed to join us honoring Enron/UT MBA Scholar Recipients Holland Brown, Christopher Cashman, and Soo Pang Tang: Dean Bob May, McComb School of Business Dr. Linda Golden, Professor of Marketing Dr. Ehud Ronn, Director of Energy Finance Dr. Angela Dorsey, Assistant Director of Energy Finance Dr. Beverly Hadaway, Director of EDS Financial Trading & Technical Center See you there!
1124	Sally
1125	Please print a color copy for me.
1125	Thanks.
1125	Also, forward to Bob Hall - I can never be sure that attachments forward correctly.
1125	Thanks.
1125	--Sally
1126	RE: Golf Tournament at Ravenaux Country Club, Monday, November 19th 11:00 am Registration and Range Balls; 12:00 Noon Shotgun Start Please send me the list players for each foursome, along with their handicaps and phone numbers by Friday this week?
1126	Thanks.
1126	Will provide more information for all players prior to tournament.
1126	Foursomes Beth Apollo (2): EES and Global Services Brent Price (1) Kevin Sweeney (1) Bob Hall (2): Risk and Logistics Chantelle: Brent has given me names of players for his foursome - Brent, Scott Earnest; John Swinney and Frank Prejean.
1126	Can you get handicaps and phone numbers (Enron) for me?
1126	Thanks.
1127	To give you more free time on the weekend...
1127	Shona: Does this impact you?
1127	Does anyone in your group plan to be in over the weekend?
1128	Since I was undecided on this meeting, I did not RSVP.
1128	You may have already done so for me.
1128	I do want to let them know that I plan to attend now.
1128	Thanks.
1128	--Sally I do see Piper on the invitation list.
1129	Is this for all assistants within ENW?
1129	How many are there?
1129	I would certainly be glad to split the cost with Mark and Greg.
1129	--Sally
1130	I will be there.
1130	I will fill you and Mark in on what we hear.
1130	--Sally
1131	Thanks for the info, Bob.
1131	I will get you more details on the tournament in early November.
1131	--Sally
1132	Thanks, Jeff.
1132	I will get you more info for you and your team in early November.
1132	--Sally
1133	I am going to miss the reception on Sunday evening and interviews on Monday.
1133	I will arrive on Monday night and will interview on Tuesday.
1133	Look forward to seeing you then.
1133	--Sally
1134	Do you want to have Jenny Rub join us for this budget meeting to review IT Infrastructure costs?
1134	She owns that piece of the ENW budget.
1134	Let me know.
1134	Another option is that Anthony and I could cover those costs, with the option to contact Jenny if more detail is required.
1134	--Sally
1135	Thanks for taking the lead on this.
1135	Let me know if I can help.
1135	--Sally
1136	Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.
1136	Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.
1136	MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.
1136	I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.
1136	Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.
1136	As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!).
1136	We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.
1136	I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.
1136	I discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.
1136	Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?
1136	I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.
1136	Beth Perlman suggested that we included Senior Directors and above.
1136	Are you two okay with this?
1136	--Sally
1137	This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.
1137	We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.
1137	We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron.
1137	We can give you a complete recap at end of day.
1137	Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.
1137	If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.
1137	Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC
1138	I will be at the Hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and I hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well.
1138	Certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today, there will be many questions for Ken, Greg and Mark to address tomorrow.
1138	It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.
1138	To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.
1138	This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.
1138	It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.
1138	--Sally Please let Christina Valdez know today (x39106 or e-mail) if you will be at lunch on Tuesday so that we can place an order.
1139	It's about 6:45 pm right now - I need to spend 15 minutes or so on open items on my desk, then I will be headed home.
1139	Commute takes about 35 minutes this time of night.
1139	Try me in the car about 7:15 pm tonight and I can fill you in during my commute.
1139	Feel free to call me at home tonight as well.
1139	Best after 9:30 pm - 281-370-8568.
1139	Other option will be during my commute tomorrow morning.
1139	Try me in the car about 7:15 am.
1139	--Sally
1140	Robin: Several people gave me ad requests for the November newsletter.
1140	I have had a crazy day at the office - should actually have been travelling to OU to interview students today.
1140	Here are the ad contents.
1140	I will try to call you on my way home and see if it is convenient to drop by the forms and the money.
1140	In case I miss you, here are the contents: Ashley Stone Congratulations on being voted "Wittiest" at Klein.
1140	We always knew you were!
1140	Love, Mom, Dad and Stefani Congratulations!
1140	Pam Martin National Merit Commended Student Love, Mom and Dad Happy 17th Birthday Kim (her mom didn't put a last name, but we may want to - I am blank, she is the daughter of Barbara ??????, our historian) With love and friendship' Vivian and Lori Young Happy 13th Birthday Chelsey Klingsporn (check spelling of name in directory - her mom paid for ad, but did not fill out a pink slip) Love, Mom and Dad Other newsletter items: Nancy Ramsey wanted to mention that sympathy goes out to Theresa and (her daughter's name?) on the death of their mother-in-law and grandmother There will be a food drive for TEAM and NAM at the December tea - Claire Loria was to check with philanthropy chairs to find out if certain items would be needed by the TEAM and NAM food pantries - did she send you that detail?
1140	--Sally
1141	Information forwarded below indicates that through October 22, we have not seen a drop off in deal counts executed through EnronOnline for derivatives trading.
1141	Please let me know if you need additional information.
1141	--Sally Beck (x35926)
1142	I will mail the checks and money to Barb.
1142	There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.
1142	One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.
1142	She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.
1142	I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "filler".
1142	Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.
1142	Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.
1142	I have the recipe in my briefcase.
1142	Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!
1142	At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.
1142	Had planned to drop that off as well.
1142	I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.
1142	Thanks again for all of your hard work!!!
1142	--Sally
1143	Pumpkin recipe dip attached.
1143	Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.
1143	Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?
1143	That is the job that you are really doing!
1143	Meagan sent her application in to OU today.
1143	It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.
1143	But it is nice to get one out the door!
1143	--Sally My assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national.
1144	If you can make a call from where you are, let mw know and I will give you a download on both the all-employee meeting and our lunch meeting.
1144	--Sally Feel free also to call me during my commute home tonight (613-417-1591) or at home tonight (281-370-8568).
1144	Happy birthday tomorrow!
1144	--Sally
1145	EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday, October 24 to Monday, November 5.
1145	Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews.
1145	McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).
1145	I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.
1145	Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.
1145	They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.
1145	Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.
1145	When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.
1145	Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.
1145	I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.
1145	The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.
1145	I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.
1145	--Sally
1146	I am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.
1146	I noticed that the Dean jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".
1146	The University does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you have not received that.
1146	It was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.
1146	Please keep me posted on your plans after graduation.
1146	Sally Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC
1147	Didn't notice this e-mail yesterday!!
1147	--Sally
1148	I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.
1148	I thought that Murray was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.
1148	I asked Christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in Houston this week so that he could be included.
1148	I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.
1148	Does he report to you?
1148	Hope that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.
1148	I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.
1148	So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.
1148	--Sally
1149	I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.
1149	Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.
1149	I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.
1149	I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.
1149	Here are his ideas.
1149	Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.
1149	Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.
1149	I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.
1149	I could certainly use some help, however.
1149	You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.
1149	Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.
1149	Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.
1149	Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.
1149	Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.
1149	This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.
1149	As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.
1149	Your thoughts?
1149	--Sally
1150	In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.
1150	I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!
1150	Here are his ideas.
1150	My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.
1150	Any thoughts?
1150	--Sally
1151	Data only: Enron Board met this morning; afternoon management committee meeting had been planned for today beginning at 2:30; that afternoon session postponed; short meeting with management committee was held an hour ago.
1151	Call me later if you want details.
1151	--Sally
1152	Major budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - Anthony Dayao, Beth Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through.
1152	Finalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.
1152	Can give you the details on why later today.
1152	Will become obvious.
1152	Just meet with Shankman and McConnell.
1152	Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet.
1152	They say that their commercial guys are waiting for Jeff Johnson to get with them on details of IT development projects.
1152	I think that Jeff has been out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down there with Shankman and McConnell.
1152	I will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.
1152	Jeff and Mike want to have their stuff finalized by Friday.
1152	I will convey that timeline to Jeff Johnson.
1152	After EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.
1152	High priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be obvious.
1152	I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be required to help us extract necessary info.
1152	Nice way of telling you, Greg, that I understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for Whalley, and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today.
1152	I will work with Kerry on this.
1152	I can tell you, however, that updates on budgets are not top on anyone's lists today, including Whalley's.
1152	We will honor your commitment to get him updated information, and will provide as much detail as possible.
1152	Best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview (that one page of expense and capital), state where we are in the review process with each business unit, and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date.
1152	We can continue to provide updates to Whalley as the EES, EIM, EGM and EBS (yes, I need to coordinate with Mark P. when he is back on some changes here - confidential at this point).
1152	Don't know how useful detailed footnotes will be for Whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets.
1152	--Sally|
1153	Please print message and attachment for me.
1153	Thanks.
1153	--Sally (then message can be deleted)
1154	Please print attachement on cashflows for me - then delete my e-mail.
1154	Thanks.
1155	Let's talk tomorrow about how we get everyone on the ball and thinking.
1156	Thanks for letting me know about this.
1156	I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.
1156	I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.
1156	--Sally
1157	I won't sent this to you daily, but this is what we are providing to Treasury each day.
1157	FYI --Sally
1158	In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.
1158	Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.
1158	In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.
1158	We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.
1158	Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.
1158	Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.
1158	I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.
1158	In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.
1158	I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.
1158	If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.
1158	-Sally
1159	Please see exchange below.
1159	Can you send me current plans - who, when, where and what - for London reviews?
1159	I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you.
1159	Thanks.
1159	--Sally I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.
1159	What happened to that effort?
1159	Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world.
1160	I know you are both busy.
1160	Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.
1160	I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.
1160	However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.
1160	I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.
1160	Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.
1160	Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.
1160	--Sally
1161	Attached is a contact list for Operations, giving home and cell numbers for the Head of Operations for EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS and EEL.
1161	Also listed are the lead risk and settlements personnel for each business unit.
1161	My numbers are listed as well, so feel to call me this weekend if needed.
1161	More detailed contact lists for gas risk, power risk and settlements have been sent to Geoff Storey, as requested by Louise and John.
1161	The IT Help desk (x31411) will be running as usual 24 hours a day.
1161	The Help Desk has appropriate contact numbers for DBA's for all operating systems.
1161	If system problems are encountered, please call the Help Desk.
1161	If potential system problems are not resolved promptly, you can also contact Jenny Rub, VP of IT Infrastructure at 713-851-5456 (cell phone), 281-463-4421(home phone) or 877-345-3812 (pager).
1161	Sally Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC
1162	Thanks for finding this!
1162	I have printed it on a color copier, so I will have it with me as an example - am actually pretty close to being finished.
1162	Had a fun visit with Cara and Anna.
1162	What a cutie Anna is!
1162	And what a good baby - still haven't heard a cry, or at least not one like my kids could produce!
1162	They left after breakfast this morning, while most of us were at church.
1162	Meagan stayed home to work on essays for college applications.
1162	So sorry to hear about the car wreck.
1162	Glad that you two are okay, but what an inconvenience.
1162	Hope that the other guys insurance covers everything.
1162	--Sally
1163	Yes - at 3:40 pm.
1163	Will try to leave by 4:00 or so.
1163	--Sally
1164	Cleaning out e-mails.
1164	Does this still need approval?
1164	--Sally
1165	Let's save this in case I have to send out something to all management committee members.
1165	Thanks.
1165	--Sally
1166	In case you missed this, just wanted you to see that this Enron Net Works publication that to date has focused only on the IT organization has now been broadened in scope.
1166	The hot link to the site should work, and if you click on Features and then Energy Operations you will see the article referred to below.
1166	The editor has spoken to a couple of you also.
1166	Her plan is to get with each one of you and to run a series of articles about Operations.
1166	--Sally
1167	Yes, it has only taken me 23 days to respond, but yes I would like to get this report.
1167	Thanks.
1167	--Sally
1168	Approval still required?
1168	Please let me know.
1168	Thanks.
1168	--Sally (I do want to see all of these right now)
1169	I am just a little tardy in working my way through e-mails!
1169	I understand that you will be joining Beth Apollo's risk team in EES soon.
1169	A win-win situation for everyone involved, I believe.
1169	Please let me know when you will next be in town - would love to see you.
1169	--Sally
1170	approval still needed?
1171	Need to use this in contact list that I believe Tina put together for ENW.
1172	Do we have this new one?
1173	Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!
1173	The artickale was great.
1173	In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.
1173	Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.
1173	I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.
1173	Sounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.
1173	This second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for Amanda - or her effort may have gotten diverted!
1173	I am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar.
1173	--Sally
1174	Approval still needed?
1174	I do want to review anything at this point.
1174	-Sally
1175	I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.
1175	Please check all to see if they have been approved.
1175	From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.
1175	Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.
1175	Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.
1175	Thanks.
1175	Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.
1175	I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.
1175	They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.
1175	Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.
1175	I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.
1175	Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?
1175	Thanks.
1175	Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.
1175	Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.
1175	I need to review these.
1175	Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.
1175	Then delete all of these e-mails.
1175	E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.
1175	Please print all so that I can review them.
1175	Please delete all e-mails after printing.
1175	Thanks.
1175	This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.
1175	Thanks.
1175	--Sally
1176	Please do the same thing with e-mails from MIke Jordan.
1176	thanks.
1177	Operator error - I misspelled your name.
1177	Probably too late to include.
1177	Sorry, I didn't see the failed delivery attempt until today.
1177	Been kind of hectic at Enron!
1177	--Sally
1178	Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings: (example noted below from today's meeting) Name Title Group Direct Supervisor Jeff Gossett Director Operations - Gas Risk (EA) Bob Hall La Metrice Dopson Sr. Director IT Infrastructure Jenny Rub Mark, Greg and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting.
1178	The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.
1178	I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.
1178	Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.
1178	I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.
1178	Thanks.
1178	--Sally Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?
1178	The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.
1178	I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.
1178	Thanks.
1179	Since you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from Dave on what he is looking for.
1179	Since Dave referenced ENW, I assume that we will include roles with regard to IT development projects.
1179	Do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?
1179	--Sally
1180	Will do the best we can.
1180	As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.
1180	Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).
1180	I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.
1180	Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.
1180	What would be the time commitment on Saturday?
1180	--Sally
1181	Trading activity on EnronOnline continues be at or above trade count levels for the same period last month.
1181	Jim Donnell, President and CEO of Duke Energy North America, stated at an industry conference on Friday, October 26 that for Duke it is "business as ususal" with Enron.
1181	Enron remains an active counterparty trading with Duke.
1181	At the same Independent Petroleum Association of Amercia industry event, Joe Bob Perkins, group president for Reliant Energy's wholesale businesses, stated that Reliant continues to actively trade with Enron as well.
1182	I left individual voice mail messages for Chris, Johnny, John, Tom, Keith, Susan and Susie tonight, thanking them for spending part of their Saturday in the office.
1182	I appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the DPR could be completed Saturday morning and delivered to RAC for their further analysis over the weekend.
1182	Thanks, too, for spending part of your weekend in the office.
1182	Your willingness to pitch in and your constructive suggestions on leading and motivating employees is very much appreciated.
1183	Sounds good.
1183	I can be flexible - I will let Christina know to expect a call from your assistant on this.
1183	--Sally
1184	Causey concurs with postponing Doorstep reviews.
1184	Haven't heard back from Buy, but I will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as I do.
1184	I agree - no need to prepare anything at this point while we are waiting for Buy's response.
1184	--Sally
1185	FYI
1186	Thought that my e-mail message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting London re: Doorstep Reviews until I circled back with you after conversations with Buy and Causey.
1186	Sounds as if that moratorium either wasn't communicated or wasn't observed.
1186	Causey left me a voice mail message on Sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all EEL reviews at present.
1186	Still waiting on Buy.
1186	I will find him today.
1187	Just heard from Buy - he is in agreement with postponing Doorstep reviews for now.
1187	He has asked me to create a tickler for this in January.
1187	--Sally
1188	Some interesting thoughts - many do hit home.
1188	Thought that I would pass this along so that we can discuss it when we get together for lunch tomorrow.
1188	--Sally
1189	Yes, this was to be the review with Corp. - Lay, Whalley and Frevert.
1189	I am working with Mark LIndsey on the revised schedule - still don't have one, but I will let you know as soon as I know something.
1189	--Sally
1190	Please print the attached on Enron letterhead and fax to Marilou ASAP at The Tremont House.
1190	Thanks!
1191	Please print on letterhead and fax to Treemont house to Eugene Vaughan.
1191	Thanks.
1192	I know that your employees appreciate these meetings.
1192	Thanks for staying so focused!
1192	--Sally
1193	Yes, I will be able to attend.
1193	Thanks.
1193	--Sally
1194	I will call you on this one...Sally
1195	No
1196	I am finally making it all the way through old e-mails.
1196	I will try to call you and talk through all of this.
1196	I am probably not as familiar as I should be on the procedures that exist.
1196	--Sally
1197	What are the plain facts around this Rexam deal?
1197	--Sally
1198	Here are contact numbers for Steve: Work 512-427-3307 Cell 512-431-7739 I will see you tomorrow at 9:30.
1198	--Sally
1199	The November newsletter looked great!
1199	This message was sent by Beverly Gibson for the December newsletter.
1199	At Monday's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.
1199	She doesn't have an electronic copy.
1199	I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.
1199	Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.
1199	(This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).
1199	Do you have that?
1199	If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.
1199	--Sally
1200	Please join Greg Piper and me for an ENW Management Team meeting at 8:30 am in Conference Room # 4990 on the fourth floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, November 8.
1200	Mark Pickering is travelling and may be able to join us by phone.
1200	Please notify me only if you are unable to attend.
1200	Thank you.
1200	--Sally
1201	Please print on legal paper and let's discuss.
1201	Thanks.
1202	Exciting news on the house, but I know that you must be busy!
1202	When we moved to Champion Forest, we did the same thing.
1202	Called the real estate agent to list our house on a Monday, got a contract on our house on Tuesday, and put a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week.
1202	You and your husband must be into quick decision making as well!!
1202	Yes, life at Enron is interesting these days.
1202	Kind of like a soap opera.
1202	Difficult for everyone to stay focused.
1202	We are ready for some good news here.
1202	With your move, let me know how I can help more with this December newsletter.
1202	It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you.
1202	I am glad that you have the permission slip in hand.
1202	--Sally
1203	Thanks for your help.
1203	--Sally
1204	FYI
1205	Spoke to Allen - this outage will not take place this weekend and is tentatively rescheduled for the weekend of November 17.
1205	The feasibility of that timing will be re-evaluated at the end of next week.
1205	--Sally
1206	FYI - no move to the new building this week.
1206	--Sally
1207	Thanks so much for your note.
1207	It is certainly nice to know that your thoughts are with me.
1207	I, too, enjoyed visiting with you at our Woodlands session.
1207	I was so sorry to miss the second forum, but I certainly feel that I made the right decision to be here.
1207	When some of this is behind us at Enron, I do hope to get reconnected with the on-going efforts resulting from the CHF.
1207	--Sally
1208	Please print for me.
1208	Highly confidential - cannot be discussed yet.
1208	Thanks.
1208	--Sally
1209	Contact numbers are listed below for Greg Piper and me if needed over the weekend.
1209	Mark Pickering is out of the country, and we are coordinating with him as we complete scenarios on reduced costs.
1209	Our team is continuing to work on this tonight and we will reconvene in the office starting at 8:00 am on Saturday.
1209	We are working in Conference Room 4100 on the 4th floor of ECS (next to my office).
1209	Please let us know when you would like to review the information.
1209	--Sally ENRON NET WORKS Office of the Chair Name Assistant # Office # Mobile # Home # Pager #
1210	FYI - If you need anything from me or Piper this weekend, thought that these contact numbers would be helpful.
1210	--Sally
1211	Everyone worked hard and did a good job on Friday night and Saturday.
1211	From IT, Jenny Rub, Steve Stock, Iain Greig, Anthony Dayao and Ramesh Rao were very engaged and did some great work.
1211	Jeff Johnson was kept updated while in route back to Houston and he is in the office today reviewing the work that has been done to date.
1211	Other ENW team members hard at work with us over the weekend have been Bob Hall, Beth Apollo, Kevin Sweeney, Kerry Roper and Marla Barnard.
1211	Greg P. and I met with Kerry Roper this am to review the summarized version of the work that has been done.
1211	Looks good - and it is unlikely that we will get with Greg Whalley to review the data this weekend.
1211	He's meeting with commercial teams currently, and then will be on a plane for NYC later today.
1211	We will take tomorrow to incorporate any changes that Jeff Johnson may have, and to get the entire weekend team to review and affirm (or change) the data as it is now summarized.
1211	I will e-mail Greg W. an update on the work that we have done today and will copy you on that message.
1211	Greg P. and I decided not to e-mail the details to him - better to review in person.
1211	He will know that we are ready.
1211	Quick preview of Monday's intended schedule: 8:00 am All direct reports of OOC of ENW will meet in Conference Room 4175 in ECS to view together the web-cast of Dynegy conference call 9:00 Following webcast, Greg P., Marla Barnard and I will meet with OOC direct reports to review Q&A and to talk about next steps 9:30 I will meet briefly with weekend team to go over work needed on Monday re: cost saving measures 10:00 The start of a whirlwind series of floor meetings to reach all ENW employees (have the details mapped out - attached is copy of spreadsheet) 4:00 Regroup with weekend team to review data revised during the day on cost saving measures 5:00 Greg P. is buying...
1211	Outstanding item on cost savings efforts: We didn't include or touch the ISC.
1211	Their budget for 2002 is included in Corp., but since responsibility now rests with you, we need to get Allan involved in the same exercise that we worked over the weekend.
1211	Would you like for me to meet with him on Monday to get him started?
1211	Then you can take it from there?
1211	Or would you like to wait and address this with Allan when you are back in the office?
1211	Just let me know.
1211	Have a good flight back.
1211	Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you tomorrow while you are in route back to Houston.
1211	--Sally
1212	Thanks - this will be a BIG effort, I know.
1212	--Sally
1213	From Dynegy's press release, here are details for Monday 8:00 am: Conference Call Simulcast Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call live via the Internet on Monday, November 12, 2001, at 8:00 a.m. CT, 9:00 a.m. ET.
1213	The webcast can be accessed via dynegy.com (click on "Investor Relations").
1213	The login number is 4365632 and the password is "Dynegy."
1214	Please join Greg Piper and me in Conference Room 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS at 8:00 am on Monday, November 12.
1214	To find this conference room, go through the security badge check point to your right as you arrive on the 4th floor, then make a left at the first hallway and the conference room will be on your right.
1214	Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call live via the Internet at 8:00 am Central Time.
1214	We will access this webcast via the two large screens in the conference room.
1214	We can watch this together as a group, and at the conclusion of the simulcast we will have a brief meeting to discuss Q&A regarding the merger and our action steps for the day as the management team of Enron Net Works.
1214	I look forward to seeing you on Monday morning.
1214	--Sally
1215	Talked with Jenny - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.
1215	I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.
1215	Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew.
1215	Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.
1215	Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included Tony Mends and Allan Sommer since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that Mark Pickering won't be here.
1215	Otherwise, Tony and Allan will be out of the loop.
1215	Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?
1215	I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's Enron extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.
1215	Brent is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.
1215	Not sure that McConnell will meet with Greg W. Brent will update me after the 3:00 meeting.
1215	--Sally
1216	We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.
1216	For each business unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below.
1216	Scenario 1: Enron exits the line of business, with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified; skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount reductions and cost savings quantified (Lights Out) Scenario 2: Enron retains and maintains line of business, but does not invest for growth; assumes no further systems enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (Lights On - But Dim) Scenario 3: Enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes; service levels are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights On - Brighter) Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM: EGM: Freight Markets EIM: Forest Products FX/IR/Equity Steel Domestic Crude & Products International Crude & Products Domestic Coal International Coal Cost savings have been identified for ENW's unallocated expense and capital as well.
1216	We have worked with HR to adjust cost savings for anticipated severance costs.
1216	--Sally Cell 713-417-1591 Home 281-370-8568
1217	Up to you and Anthony.
1217	We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.
1217	We had not been provided info that Anthony had anyone in 3AC.
1217	We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that Anthony was able to attend.
1217	Your options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 Allen Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor).
1217	I will be conducting that floor meeting at 1:00 for ENW employees in 2 Allen Center - it is Allan Sommers' ISC group.
1217	--Sally
1218	Can you update me today on status, issues and resolution?
1218	We need to get back with Bill Bradford today.
1218	--Sally
1219	This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and RPS and RGS.
1219	My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working on this interface.
1219	What is the expected completion of this interface, and if is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.
1219	With the large number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem.
1219	Can you call me today with an update?
1219	Thanks.
1219	-Sally
1220	James responded and filled me in on the issue.
1220	Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.
1220	How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?
1220	Did you know that this had grown so large?
1220	James says that this sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help.
1220	Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly.
1220	Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.
1220	I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!
1220	I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.
1220	(Don't worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).
1220	Let's talk about how we can manage this better.
1221	These counterparties are set up in GCP; however, they have not been set up in RPS and RGS.
1221	Two things are needed.
1221	First, we need an automated link from GCP to RPS and RGS.
1221	Someone on Anthony Dayao's team is assigned to this, but the project has not been completed.
1221	I have asked Anthony to update me today on how we can get this completed ASAP.
1221	This will solve the problem on a go-forward basis.
1221	The second need is a clean up effort on this backlog.
1221	I have asked Beth Apollo for an update on her plan, and I will have her review this with you later today.
1221	--Sally
1222	SInce your name was not on the original list, I am forwarding this to you.
1222	Molly's comment that "many lack the clear understanding ..."
1222	in the third paragraph below - to whom does this apply and do you agree with her?
1222	--Sally
1223	Tom, Thanks for the list of questions.
1223	I am always glad when someone takes me up on that type of offer, because I genuinely want the input from others.
1223	I have taken a quick glance at the list of questions and will take the time to read them thoroughly over a sandwich today.
1223	After reading them, I will get back to you on an effective way to answer them, as I may not be able to personnally address all.
1223	--Sally
1224	As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.
1224	We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.
1224	The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).
1224	Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon.
1224	He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.
1224	We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".
1224	There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.
1224	The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.
1224	--Sally
1225	In case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses, just learned from Brent Price (via Mike McConnell) that there is a daily meeting led by JIm Fallon with CEO's at 11:00 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list, although not final, is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations (i.e. Tokyo, Singapore, etc.) that may be exited.
1225	It is key for ENW to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time.
1225	Did you know about this meeting?
1225	Seems like you should be there.
1225	Can you nose in with Jim?
1225	--Sally
1226	Carol: Would you enlarge the attachment so I can print for Sally.
1226	Thanks, Christina
1227	Who was this who replied?
1228	Good question.
1228	All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.
1228	We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.
1228	I think that you could share this with the assistants.
1228	It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.
1228	All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.
1228	Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.
1228	I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.
1228	--Sally Just thought of this: We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and "ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.
1228	Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.
1228	We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures.
1229	As discussed during yesterday's 5:00 pm meeting, the ENW direct reports to the Office of the Chair (VP level only) will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss employee talent.
1229	The meeting will be in Conference Room # 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS from 1:00 to 4:00 pm.
1229	Please respond only if you are unable to attend.
1229	Information to be discussed in this meeting should be submitted to Marla Barnard today.
1229	Thanks for you time and attention to this.
1229	--Sally
1230	Yes, fully prepared.
1230	Thanks.
1230	--Sally Have a great time on vacation.
1230	Relax and enjoy the family.
1230	Say hello to Jo for me.
1231	Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.
1231	We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing Enron's business.
1231	HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.
1231	The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.
1231	It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.
1231	That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.
1231	I am happy to answer your questions.
1231	Feel free to send me others as the come up.
1231	--Sally
1232	Attached is list of questions.
1232	How soon could we have answers to these?
1232	I would appreciate any help that you could give me on this.
1232	--Sally
1233	I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take the day off on Wednesday.
1233	The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.
1233	So we hope to be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic.
1233	With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday, November 26.
1233	If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute.
1233	Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00 am and 8:30 am might work.
1233	These are certainly trying times.
1233	You have been in my thoughts, and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind.
1233	--Sally
1234	Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.
1234	It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.
1234	Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.
1234	He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.
1234	Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.
1234	Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.
1234	The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.
1234	How are your 5:00 pm meetings?
1234	I will catch up tomorrow.
1234	--Sally Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!
1235	It's 11:55 am on Sunday - have tried your cell phone, but did not get an answer.
1235	Left you a message that Beth, Jeff, and Brent are all here and working on their respective pieces.
1235	We will convene as a group about 12:30 here in my office.
1235	If you can join us at 1:00, we can give you an update.
1235	--Sally
1236	Great work again from your team!
1236	Thanks.
1236	--Sally
1237	From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were: Annualized Savings (in millions) & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees) Direct Costs Bonus Subtotal Net Cap Total Ops IT Accural Savings Severance Savings Ex Savings This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.
1237	identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.
1237	We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.
1237	We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.
1237	The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).
1237	The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.
1237	Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.
1237	We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.
1237	--Sally
1238	Are we having some fun now?
1238	Thought about you today - in fact, ran across a business card of yours that I had in a file from Phibro Energy.
1238	I know that I have missed your insight and opinions into Enron's roller-coaster.
1238	Is this ride better with eyes open or closed?
1238	--Sally
1239	Tough times - and lots of work.
1239	I know that you must be swamped, and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process.
1239	I am sure it is even tougher now!
1239	Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.
1239	On Rick's behalf, she was asking about London operations.
1239	I assume that you have covered that.
1239	Her specific question related to Mike.
1239	I told her that you and I hadn't talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.
1239	Accurate?
1239	Take care.
1239	-Sally
1240	Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.
1240	I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.
1240	Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.
1240	Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.
1240	We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).
1240	Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.
1240	The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.
1240	--Sally
1241	FYI...
1242	Yes.
1243	FYI - response after my call to Brian.
1243	Agreement refers to employees of Enron Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.
1243	Enron Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from Enron Networks.
1243	Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.
1243	--Sally
1244	Thanks - Anne did call me this morning with the details.
1244	--Sally
1245	I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!
1245	Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with Teddy was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at Enron.
1245	Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.
1245	My little guys aren't so little any more.
1245	Meagan is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.
1245	She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.
1245	She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.
1245	She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.
1245	(By the way, David and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current Enron share price, or diminished portion thereof.) This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the Enron Building.
1245	And mentioning the building, I moved to Enron Center South (the new building) in mid September.
1245	I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.
1245	Kinneman is on this floor, too.
1245	Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.
1245	Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.
1245	The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.
1245	We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.
1245	Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!
1245	Do let me know if you are going to be in Houston anytime soon.
1245	I would love to get together with you.
1245	Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints, my previously planned November London visit is not happening!
1245	Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.
1245	--Sally
1246	Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.
1246	THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.
1246	Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.
1246	You will want to gut check this with Beth.
1246	Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.
1246	Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.
1246	Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.
1246	You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.
1246	There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.
1246	Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).
1246	His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.
1246	But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.
1246	Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.
1246	Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed.
1246	Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.
1246	Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.
1246	Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.
1246	So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.
1246	Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed.
1246	Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.
1246	You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or David's: 713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).
1246	We will drive back from Austin sometime on Friday.
1246	Could come in on Saturday or Sunday, as needed.
1246	--Sally
1247	Thanks for your nice note.
1247	Did you get the job?
1247	I certainly hope so.
1247	I appreciate your thoughts and prayers - both are very much needed!
1247	We are all still somewhat in a state of shock over the state of the company.
1247	I find myself working lots of hours on things that several months ago we wouldn't have thought about.
1247	Life is always interesting - it may take a while to see where this twist is leading us, but I do know that it will be interesting!
1247	--Sally
1248	Thanks for the note.
1248	I wish you well as you continue to build your business outside Enron.
1248	Unfortunate circumstances here have caused us to make some tough business decisions that impact contractors such as yourself.
1248	I appreciate your hard work over the last several years and the contributions that you made in helping to manage various businesses within Enron.
1248	I am saving your e-mail address and phone number.
1248	There may be an occasion for us to work together again.
1248	Best wishes for you and your family.
1248	-Sally
1249	Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?
1249	We haven't gotten much communication from "above" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.
1249	I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.
1249	(I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).
1249	I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.
1249	If waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.
1249	One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.
1249	You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.
1249	I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur this week.
1249	Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.
1249	At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.
1249	It is not really unusual outside Enron.
1249	--Sally
1250	Let's get together tomorrow.
1250	My calendar is pretty open.
1250	Understand your request, and you have my assurance that I will be very up-front with you.
1250	No breaking news to share with you, however.
1250	Would love to get your input on the organization going forward, if you have time tomorrow.
1250	Yes, kind of of bleak.
1250	--Sally
1251	Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from Enron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.
1251	I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening.
1251	Did that, and what comes up looks like it is in tongues!!!
1251	Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully Nancy was able to review it.
1251	I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my NCL folder.
1251	I meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrific.
1251	I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.
1251	Unless Lori got that article to you in another way, we are missing that from the newsletter!
1251	I will call you and if indeed Lori's article is not in there (not the permission form, but another article), I will contact Sally and I will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.
1251	Sorry about this!!
1251	Sounds as if you had a busy Thanksgiving on top of a move as well.
1251	Hope that you are enjoying the new place.
1251	Too bad about the Sooners on Saturday.
1251	David had thought about driving to Dallas next weekend for the Big 12 Championship game, but obviously won't be doing that now!
1251	--Sally
1252	Yes, I think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weekend for the foreseeable future.
1252	I had operations teams accessing critical data, available only in SAP, on Friday evening and Sunday this past weekend.
1252	It is very likely that our need to do so will continue, unlimited to weekdays.
1252	Thanks.
1252	--Sally
1253	Our curve validation process is one of the key items that Arthur Andersen will be reviewing at year end.
1253	AA has looked for us to strengthen this process, and Tom Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this.
1253	(His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!) In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities.
1253	I want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.
1253	We will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the task force lead by Shona Wilson) and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.
1253	I have a meeting with Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week and, following today's meeting, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.
1253	You are welcome to join us in this meeting.
1253	If you do not attend, please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly.
1253	The meeting will be held as follows: 3:00 - 3:30 PM ECS 4102 (my office) Attendees: Jeff Gossett Stacey White Sam Leuschen Scott Mills John Swinney Frank Prejean Michelle Bruce EBS TBD
1254	Is Kathy the right contact?
1254	Or should it be Brian?
1254	Let's talk about changing the Canadian reporting relationships - especially risk.
1254	I think that I will propose that to Lavorato today.
1254	But let's talk first.
1254	--Sally
1255	Any ideas on why Canadian numbers wouldn't have made it into V@R calc today?
1255	--Sally
1256	Bradford called last night - some problem with SO2 marks.
1256	Bill thought that our curves were way off.
1256	Sounds as if that is not the problem but instead that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only intercompany deals and not third party deals.
1256	Book wasn't picked up in Credit's exposure, making it look as if we were off on our mark versus Barclay's mark by $20MM.
1256	I have gotten one story from Brent.
1256	What do you know about this?
1256	--Sally
1257	We need your help in completing the following today, per Sally Beck's voice mail message: Review your tab in this e-mail to verify the list of retained employees (your name should be in the list as well).
1257	Where applicable, if you have employees designated to go to NewCo, please indicate that on your list (we are striving for a list of employees who will remain with the estate).
1257	Return a hard copy of your list to Marla Barnard by 2:00 PM today, with your signature that the list is accurate and complete, or with appropriate changes/updates noted.
1257	Complete a summary template being sent to you by either Kerry Roper or Mike Galvan that will give us your total number of employees (with subtotals for those going to NewCo and those remaining with the Estate) and your total number of employees.
1257	Please complete this by 2:00 PM also.
1257	Thanks.
1258	James will be a real sport to fly with us and then turn around!!
1258	Maybe he would like to do some Christmas shopping!!
1258	That is a great fare - thanks for including us as buddies!..
1258	My hair cut appointment is on Saturday morning, the 29th, so the timing on our return on Friday the 28th is very flexible for me.
1258	Whatever flight you think would be best for us to return on will be fine.
1258	I am getting the phone number for the hotel and will forward that to you.
1258	I will also get Meagan to coordinate with Nicole on their choices on Broadway plays and then I will get tickets for us.
1258	--Sally
1259	Thanks for your call a few weeks back.
1259	Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.
1259	Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.
1259	I need the break!
1259	Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.
1259	And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.
1259	Christmas at home, as usual, and the Meagan and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend Nicole and her mom.
1259	We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!
1259	Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.
1259	Our upcoming trips are to Orlando for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition.
1259	Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!
1259	Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!
1259	Have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San Diego.
1259	Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.
1259	Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night.
1259	Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!
1259	College update: Meagan got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.
1259	She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.
1259	I have no idea what her decision will be!
1259	Our best to Paul and the girls.
1259	--Sally
1260	Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?
1260	I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.
1260	Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.
1260	SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.
1260	Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.
1260	I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.
1260	Thanks.
1260	--Sally
1261	FYI...
1262	Your champagne is under my desk.
1262	I hope that you and Craig will enjoy it!!
1262	Have a wonderful holiday and I will see you on the 31st.
1263	Sorry that we didn't get together today.
1263	I plan to be out of the office from now until Monday, December 31.
1263	I will be in Houston through Christmas, and can be available by cell phone on Thursday and Friday this week, December 20 and 21.
1263	I will be in New York for several days following Christmas, from December 26 through December 28.
1263	Tomorrow, I will send you a contact list for Mid and Back Office Operations for the remainder of this week and the week of Christmas.
1263	That contact list contains my hotel number in New York, if something critical were to arise while I am out of the office.
1263	I had provided you yesterday with a list of IT and Operations personnel to be included in the meeting to be set with Elizabeth Saeger regarding the process for handling terminations of transactions and arriving at the residual value of deals non-terminated deals in the risk books.
1263	I have not seen a meeting scheduled yet, and as you can see from the memo that I sent you yesterday, many risk book administrators will begin their vacations around Christmas this week.
1263	If you still plan to hold the meeting this week, please notify my assistant, Christina Valdez (x39106) and I will try to join in by phone.
1263	I hope that you and your family have a great Christmas.
1263	I will see you back in the office on December 31.
1263	Feel free to call me in the interim either at home or on my cell phone.
1263	--Sally
1264	Attached is the memo that Christina delivered to you/Jim on Tuesday.
1264	One update is that Scott Mills is now out of the office through Christmas.
1264	Kristin Albrecht would be the appropriate risk rep in Scott's place is a meeting were to be held this week.
1264	--Sally
1265	This is a "Draft" of process that I mentioned in our meeting in Jim's office on Monday.
1265	-----Sally
1266	I am out of the office on vacation Thursday, December 20th - Friday, December 21st.
1266	I will be in town and can be reached by cell phone over the next few days (713-417-1591).
1266	On Wednesday, December 26 - Friday, December 28 ( following Christmas), I will be in New York.
1266	My contact number/hotel while in New York is listed on the attached in the event something critical should arise.
1266	I am attaching for your convenience a "Holiday Key Contact" list for operations for the business units.
1266	Have a safe and wonderful holiday!
1266	--Sally
1267	Mari: Here's the contact list Sally asked I forward to you.
1267	Christina Valdez Asst.
1267	to Sally Beck
1268	Does any of this make sense to the two of you?
1268	Please get back with me pon January 3rd and let me know if we do have outstanding issues with AEP and if we have unfinished projects from Carolyn Guilley.
1268	Thanks.
1268	--Sally
1269	More info related to first e-mail...
1270	Pretty cute - makes me want to open a roll of cookie dough when I get home today!!
1270	Happy New Year!
1270	--Sally
1271	ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.
1271	In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.
1271	Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.
1271	Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?
1271	I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.
1271	I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.
1271	--Sally
1272	The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.
1272	Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?
1272	Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.
1272	We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.
1272	Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.
1272	Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.
1272	Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.
1272	Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.
1272	He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.
1272	Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.
1272	The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.
1272	He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.
1272	If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.
1272	Let's discuss.
1272	--Sally
1273	There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.
1273	Two of the three are Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to Louise.
1273	Another excellent player is Shona Wilson.
1273	She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.
1273	She had excellent experience with PWC before joining Enron, auditing trading companies in Europe.
1273	I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.
1273	She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.
1273	I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.
1273	If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.
1273	--Sally
1274	Do you have a few minutes to get with me this week?
1274	You seem to be the "in charge" person for the Estate.
1274	I wanted to visit with you about the needs that you see for the Estate and the role that I might play.
1274	I am focused currently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of Netco (from an operations perspective), although I am not on the list to go with Netco.
1274	I am also working with Jim Fallon on supporting the business plans for the remaining wholesale businesses within Enron.
1274	Greg PIper and I also still share the OOC responsibilities for Enron Net Works as well.
1274	I am committed to Enron, but would appreciate a frank discussion about the timeline you see for me at Enron.
1274	I need to have a job, and want to be appropriately prepared if the timeframe for me at Enron is limited.
1274	Thanks.
1274	--Sally
1275	Rick: Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are "baked enough" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?
1275	My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.
1275	Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.
1275	Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.
1275	Thanks.
1275	--Sally
1276	Louise: Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list?
1276	We can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem.
1276	--Sally
1277	FYI...
1278	Sorry - I read the first e-mail before seeing this one.
1278	Thanks for not asking me where my head was when we talked!!
1278	--Sally
1279	What are our communications with terminated employees and are there administrative obstacles impacting them as the note below would indicate?
1279	If there is a backlog of info regarding employee status, I will be happy to key punch to get caught up.
1279	I am trainable and very willing!!!
1279	--Sally
1280	Mike: Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?
1280	Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.
1280	--Sally
1281	Mark received a payment in late November that stated that it would have to be repaid in full if he leaves Enron before the end of February 2002.
1281	How do we handle this?
1281	Has Mark mentioned this repayment?
1281	--Sally
1282	Big Pig: Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.
1282	All went well.
1282	The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.
1282	I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.
1282	They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.
1282	The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.
1282	I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.
1282	This is not currently included in the data room.
1282	Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?
1282	Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.
1282	The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.
1282	Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.
1282	He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.
1282	Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.
1282	He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.
1282	FYI.
1283	I will include Kerry in this meeting with Mike.
1283	Do you want to attend as well?
1283	Let me know, and we will schedule it so that it works for you, too.
1283	--Sally
1284	Please schedule a meeting for Thurday afternoon (30 minutes) with Mike DeVille, Kerry Roper, Greg Piper and me to review the operating budgets for 2002, and the impact on the ENW operating budget.
1284	Thanks.
1285	Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.
1285	I will coordinate with him on org charts.
1285	Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?
1285	Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.
1285	Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.
1285	I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.
1285	--Sally
1286	Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.
1286	Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.
1286	Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.
1286	Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.
1286	--Sally
1287	Kristin was there - I had to cut it short by a few minutes to meet with Delainey in the other building., Kristin stayed for a few more minutes to talk with Jeff and Stacey.
1287	I can give you a more detailed download of all meetings tomorrowl --Sally
1288	Was Jim asking questions about the number of employees in ENW who would remain with the Estate?
1288	Summary looks good - our meeting with Mike Deville on 2002 budgets is scheduled for tomorrow.
1288	--Sally
1289	Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.
1289	I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest.
1289	With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.
1289	What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.
1289	In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.
1289	I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.
1289	And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.
1289	Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.
1289	Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.
1289	--Sally
1290	Just to keep you up-to-date with the saga...
1291	Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.
1291	His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.
1291	I told him that we would be glad to work with him.
1291	We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.
1291	Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.
1291	I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.
1291	Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?
1291	--Sally
1292	FYI...
1293	As discussed - happy reading on the plane...
1293	Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC
1294	Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.
1294	As you may know, one of our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.
1294	With the money and talent that has been poured into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.
1294	Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.
1294	Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.
1294	Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enron that was offering these services.
1294	The market place didn't want us to "win again" as Enron.
1294	Obviously, the world has changed.
1294	While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.
1294	The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.
1294	With the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "independent" services company to provide services.
1294	Servicing the Enron Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.
1294	Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools, the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc. Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained.
1294	Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.
1294	There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.
1294	We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this.
1294	Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our hope would be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted.
1294	The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.
1294	Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.
1294	It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.
1294	If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?
1294	Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?
1294	To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process.
1294	Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.
1294	--Sally
1295	I have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever.
1295	I have coordinated with Bob Hall this morning and he will attend the 10:00 meeting in ECN 30C1.
1295	He will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have.
1295	All that I could do at this point is cough and nod!
1295	I could certainly answer any questions for the Euros via e-mail, if needed, over the weekend.
1295	Call me at home (281-370-8568) and I will be glad to do so.
1295	I do expect to be in the office on Monday - hopefully with a voice.
1295	--Sally
1296	Sorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.
1296	Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.
1296	We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.
1296	My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.
1296	And your lead in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was such a surprise.
1296	Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with Cindy, Richard, Brigeda, Chris and Cara staying in our home as well.
1296	With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.
1296	What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.
1296	But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.
1296	I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.
1296	Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit.
1296	I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.
1296	Sounds as if we should make that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.
1296	I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.
1296	I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that David would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.
1296	David has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.
1296	Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.
1296	But again, whatever works best for you.
1296	Just let us know.
1296	--Sally
1297	I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.
1297	I have an eye doctor's appointment at 9:30, so it is also unlikely that I will be able to call in, unless I am pleasantly surprised and he is running on time!
1297	I will take the dial in number with me to the appointment in the event that I am somewhere in the process that allows me to dial in. --Sally
1298	I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.
1298	Tana Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.
1298	Do you need anything else?
1298	Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?
1298	Let me know.
1298	I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.
1298	We have Jeff covered, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.
1298	Tana was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.
1298	As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.
1298	Thanks.
1298	--Sally
1299	Doing fine - still in the boat.
1299	At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.
1299	Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed.
1299	I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.
1299	Jim seems busy with these issues.
1299	I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.
1299	I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).
1299	These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.
1299	I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.
1299	Seems like a good group.
1299	--Sally
1300	Anything we can do on this?
1300	Thanks.
1300	--Sally
1301	Where are we on decisions on promotions?
1301	Last time I asked, it was under consideration.
1301	Kevin has a good idea here.
1301	Can you give us an update?
1301	Thanks.
1301	--Sally
1302	You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.
1302	We have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed how we will manage the Estate going forward.
1302	What role do you envision that I will play?
1302	Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?
1302	I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.
1302	With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.
1302	I will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.
1302	--Sally
1303	John: I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.
1303	(The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.
1303	At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.
1303	But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.
1303	We need some questions answered first to go through this: 1) Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?
1303	Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.
1303	Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.
1303	We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.
1303	Need names and weekend contact numbers.
1303	2) What will the overall headcount be for Netco?
1303	What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.
1303	If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.
1303	3) Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?
1303	Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?
1303	Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?
1303	4) What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?
1303	What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?
1303	There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.
1303	One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.
1303	That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!
1303	We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.
1303	Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?
1303	5) Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?
1303	This may impact our staffing needs.
1303	What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?
1303	We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.
1303	--Sally
1304	I have left John a message about the e-mail.
1304	No response yet.
1304	Will call Leslie, Stacey and Jeff as soon as I finish breakfast.
1305	Happy for Hector and Laura to attend.
1305	--Sally
1306	Congratulations on a job done well in a short period of time.
1306	Your note of thanks to everyone was a nice one.
1306	I am sure that the team appreciates your leadership.
1306	--Sally
1307	Did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?
1307	Amy Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.
1307	Our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions.
1307	We identified names in most cases, but not all.
1307	Before that is finalized and I pass names along to Amy, I wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers.
1307	Please let me know.
1307	Names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers.
1307	--Sally Cell: 713-417-1591
1308	Thanks.
1308	--Sally
1309	1) I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.
1309	Please coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of replacing Daren.
1309	2) I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.
1309	He is on the current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational Databases (part of the Documentation team).
1309	It is correct that his name is on the list that I provided to you yesterday.
1309	Let me know if you have any other questions.
1309	--Sally
1310	1) Did you add to the numbers that Jeff and I reviewed with you on Sunday?
1310	You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?
1310	UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers.
1310	2) What about Calgary?
1310	You were going to ask Rob M. to have Peggy Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.
1310	Didn't hear from her.
1310	Are you handling this through Rob?
1310	Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?
1310	--Sally
1311	That was my third or fourth time at Ibeza - I have enjoyed it each time.
1311	It is a great place for outside dining when the weather works for that.
1311	--Sally
1312	FYI
1313	LeMetrice is either a director or senior director under Jenny - kind of a second in command.
1313	She worked extensively on the original 2002 budget for Infrastructure and put together some data on functions within the Infrastructure group that gave a somewhat layman's explanation of the various services provided.
1313	We have already gone through the process of rebudgeting dollars and headcount for 2002, post bankruptcy and December 2 lay offs, and with the projected Netco spin off.
1313	It is likely that LeMetrice has all of those details.
1313	So despite a somewhat short answer from Jenny, she was actually on target to refer you to her.
1313	-Sally
1314	Thanks for your nice note.
1314	While the journey has been interesting, to say the least, I am very excited about what we can do and committed to the effort.
1314	I am glad that we will be able to continue working together.
1314	--Sally
1315	Your info is right - although I do hope that all is not dark.
1315	Wouldn't have imagined this outcome two weeks ago.
1315	But when Bob Hall removed his name from the Netco list, timing was critical in working with potential purchasers in the auction process.
1315	There wasn't anyone else to step in, so I did so just to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition.
1315	I spent many hours with the UBS operations team last week, and they are the ones who decided that they wanted me to take the role.
1315	It was the time that I spent with the UBS team that changed my mind about considering the role.
1315	My reporting relationship will be to the head of American operations in Stamford, CT.
1315	I am quite impressed with him.
1315	The further negative news here was a factor as well.
1315	Should be interesting.
1315	--Sally
1316	The best list of operations employees involved in UBS Warburg Energy is the executed offer letters and employment agreements that have been turned in. I also have an up-to-date org chart.
1316	Can we reconcile your distribution list with this org chart?
1316	I would like to get his right.
1316	--Sally
1317	Don't know what works best with your schedule.
1317	Ernie Pitterelli (head of Operatins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calculation of P&L.
1317	Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, so it could be helpful for you to be here.
1317	What was Wes' response?
1317	--Sally
1318	Today was parent/teacher conference day at Tyler's preschool and I had signed up for the 9:00 am slot.
1318	Sorry that I couldn't make the meeting.
1318	I had asked Bob Hall to attend in my place - I know that he also had an 8:30 am meeting related to retention, so I don't know whether or not he made it to your meeting.
1318	What is your calendar like for drinks next week?
1318	--Sally
1319	Great - I will look forward to seeing you next week.
1319	--Sally
1320	FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).
1320	The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.
1320	I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.
1320	I have put up with this for 3 days.
1320	If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.
1320	Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?
1320	I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!
1320	Thanks.
1320	--Sally
1321	Declines in Houston and replacements are noted below: Declined Replaced by Chris Chang (Financial Settlements) Gordon Heaney Kelli Little (Gas Risk Management) Matt Olney Anna Kulic (Gas Risk Management) Monte Jones Susan Scott (Gas Scheduling) Shannon Groenwald I do not have updated information on acceptances or declines from Portland or Calgary Operations at this time.
1321	--Sally
1322	Let's coordinate on needs for confirmations and settlements.
1322	Can someone on your team specify what their needs will be?
1322	Then we can determine the best method to obtain the machines.
1322	I will have copies of the floor plans for 5 and 6 sometime this morning -- we should determine best placement for these.
1322	--Sally
1323	FYI - While I simply received an assessment from Jenny, there is obviously a listing of equipment that exists.
1323	Looks as if Paige Cox on Jenny's team would be the person to get with on this.
1323	--Sally

17	Hello Mr. Uutella, I am an analyst working for Enron Industrial Markets in Houston, Texas and I am gathering some information on tissue.
17	I spoke to Rod Young and David Pinault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive studies on tissue usage.
17	What I am looking for are: tissue capacity worldwide and by region (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia) and the biggest companies that produce tissue.
17	Can you also include how much this information would cost?
17	Thanks in advance, Monika Causholli Enron Industrial Markets
18	Andrea, I found a private consultant on tissue (as RISI does not do anything on the subject) and he is located in Germany.
18	Below is the kind of information that he can make available to us as well as the costs.
18	Can you please advice me on how much information we want to get from him based on what he wrote below?
19	Dick, Just spoke with Peter Cardellichio at RISI who is the person in charge oh Asia and he told me that their forecast for Japan is based on the European prices.
19	He said that prices in Europe and Japan have been pretty close historically thus he uses European prices as a base and adjusts thoem based on what is happening to Asia.
19	Hope this helps, Monika
20	Jim, I found a consultant who does extensive studies on world tissue.
20	PLease read below.
20	Just wanted to know if you knew the guy.

29	I found one guy in Germany that seems to do quite an extensive work on tissue.
29	I sent you an email yesterday stating what he can offer us and what the costs are.
29	Also note that fluff pulp data is very limited.
29	I am waiting David Pinault from RISI to get back to me as he is researching and digging inside his organization to find anything on the fluff pulp.
29	All these data can be added to the presentation upon availiability.
29	Thanks, Monika
30	Karen, You are right.
30	I should have included some of my comments on the FOEX recent trends.
30	I''ll keep that in mind for next time.
30	Thanks, Monika
31	Hello Avril, We have found some good info on tissue paper from an independent consulting company.I talked to Andrea so we are going to go and purchase the study.

33	You need the following ingredients: Trout Fish (medium size) About 4 big yellow onions- chopped into little pieces About 4 pieces of garlic- also chopped in little pieces Tomato Sauce Red Pepper Black Pepper Bay Leaf Lemon Juice Salt White wine Vegetable Oil The process: 1- Clean and wash the fish.
33	Cut the head off you don't need that.
33	Place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it.
33	Leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce.
33	2- In another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions.
33	After about 4 min add a little black pepper, red pepper, garlic, salt and bay leaf and stir.
33	3- Continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color.
33	Then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring.
33	You will have a reddish sauce ready.
33	4- In a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish.
33	Place the fish in the middle.
33	Then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven.
33	Keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast.
33	When you serve it ad lemon juice again.
33	Another way of cooking the trout fish (much easier and I think tastier) Get a small trout this time., After cleaning it place it in a baking pan.
33	Then add olive oil into it (lots of it), lemon juice, chopped tomatoes (about 2 tomatoes) , and olives.
33	Just bake it and there you have it.
33	Again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice.
33	It's delicious!
33	Try any of these and let me know how they taste.
33	Have fun Monika

36	SAO PAULO, Oct. 4, 2001 (Press release) Votorantim Celulose e Papel (VCP) announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire, through one of its affiliates, a 28% voting interest (12.3% total interest) in Aracruz Celulose, the Brazilian eucalyptus pulp company.
36	The stake is being acquired from Mondi Brazil, a subsidiary of Anglo American for a cash consideration of $370 million.
36	Raul Calfat, CEO of VCP, said, "This transaction represents an important step for VCP in strengthening our position in the global pulp and paper markets. This also enhances our status as one of the lowest cost producers with outstanding services to our customers. We are very pleased with this opportunity which we believe will create substantial value for our shareholders."
36	Andrew Thompson, chairman of Mondi Brazil, said, "We evaluated the options for our investment in Aracruz and concluded that it was in the interests of our shareholders to sell our stake on these terms. We have valued being party to the development of Aracruz during our time as voting shareholders with board representation. We have been particularly impressed by the vision and leadership of Erling Lorentzen as founder and chairman. We are confident that VCP will be a supportive new voting shareholder and we wish both them and Aracruz success in the future."

43	Hello Margaret, I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security, IRS, and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all.
43	We are confused.
43	My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence.
43	He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence.
43	Do you know what the law is in this case?
43	Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem?
43	Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how.
43	Please help us, Thanks a lot Monika Cauhsolli
44	I will be attending.

65	SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct 15, 2001 (Reuters) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker Industrias Klabin Papel e Celulose SA said on Monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais ($22 million) per year.
65	Klabin, one of Brazil's top producers of paper, tissue and wood pulp, will incorporate its Klamasa, KIV, Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA , the company said in a statement.
65	Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA.
65	Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par, Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters.
65	The restructuring, to be completed by December, should reduce administrative, operational, financial and tax costs.
65	It will also improve operating synergies, allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors, Klabin said.
65	"We have a lot of business between the group. That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies," Verillo said.
65	The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais ($22 million) per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring.
65	In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001, driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil's currency.
65	The company posted net revenues of 1.9 billion reais ($684 million) in 2000.

78	Dave, I am meeting with Maria Teresa this Wednesday to start working on price forecast.
78	I am currently working with Andrew on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows: Based on the formula (capacity * op. rate) - shipments = forecast inventory.
78	We used PPPC capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the monthly forecast.
78	Then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward, or the last month's operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next month op.
78	rate.
78	We also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the month we are trying to forecast.
78	So far we have only tested September and the forecast was pretty close to the actual.
78	let me know if this is what you requested, Thanks, Monika
79	Karen, Attached is the capacity growth compounded annually for the main regions and the world.

95	San Francisco, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase the U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/tonne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source.
95	Another buyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys, "and I assume on the others."
95	Weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment.
95	Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American producers went to $500/tonne.
95	The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts.
95	Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the market, but also because demand has been so slow.
95	A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/tonne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price.
95	"I don't think we will pay $500 (in November)," a buyer said today.
95	"I think it will be $490."
95	An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a plus," but added, "Now all we need is for demand to pick up."
95	Another agent also responded cautiously.
95	"There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that, (producers) can announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk," he said.
95	As for October transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't move.
95	"I know everyone needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have gone down, but my feeling is they will go up again," he said, noting typical late-fall patterns.
95	said that in contrast to the past, paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices.
95	"It's going to be a battle, for sure," he said.
95	"There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buyers) are saying they're not going to pay it."
96	Doug, Why is the map cut off at the top?
96	Can you fix this so that it shows all of it?
96	thanks, Monika
97	Count me too!
98	The good news in terms of pricing is that consumption rose this month by 16%, and higher consumption levels will deplete inventories and consumers will need to replace those inventories faster.
98	Hopefully consumption will continue to grow over the next several months.
98	Monika
99	Thanks!
99	this is better.

108	G-P Leaf River pulp mill sale deal with Enron falls through By Diane Keaton San Francisco, Oct. 24, 2001 (Forestweb) -- The tentative deal for Georgia-Pacific Corp. (G-P) to sell its Leaf River market pulp mill to Enron Corp. has collapsed, according to a knowledgeable industry source.
108	Neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development, citing policies against commenting on rumors.
108	However, the pending arrangement, subject to final approval, was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players (see Forestweb, Oct.19).
108	Top Enron officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week.
108	Last week in its third quarter earnings statement, the company reported a net loss of $618 million, including a write-off of $1.01 billion.
108	The source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date.
108	The Leaf River mill, in New Augusta, Miss., has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per year.
108	Since February it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp.
109	Thanks!
110	Andrew, As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests.
110	There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.
110	Second, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit, more in line with the historical average now.
110	Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet.

117	If you have any questions you can contact me.
117	thanks, Monika Causholli Ext.

118	Thanks Peggy!
119	hey Stacey, thanks for sending me the presentation template.
119	Monika
120	Hi Karen, I hope you get well soon!
120	I had Peggy edit the market wrap.
120	I sent it out this morning.
120	Also, I have finished working on the Tissue Report.
120	Do you want it send by email?
120	Let me know, Monika
121	Sorry Morela.

121	Monika
122	Hey Doug, Here is what would be great to have: for Pulp All the mills, their most updated capacity (can you also find out how often they update the capacity and whether they remove the maintenance related downtime when they come up with the capacity number) and the type of pulp they produce.
122	for Printing & Writing paper same thing for paper too.In addition, what kind of pulp they use to produce the paper.
122	Can we get the same info in a spreadsheet from too?
122	thanks, Monika
123	Today FOEX published its weekly index for pulp: For the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again.
123	NBSK was down $US0.48 or 0.1% after four weeks of price increases.
123	BHKP was Euro 466 down Euro 3.34.
123	Expressed in US dollars BHKP was $US416.09 down $US2.33 or 0.56%.
123	These decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers, including Weyerhaeuser, to raise prices.
123	This might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals do not support the price increases in pulp.
123	The average FOEX for October is: BHKP:$US 414.76 up $13.67 from the September level Please attached for a chart of FOEX prices
124	Done!
125	Karen, Attached is the Tissue Summary.

127	Dave, Here is the report on RISI conference.
127	thanks, Monika
128	Hello Jim, It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again.
128	I am still working for Enron, but I moved away from Oregon.
128	Now me and my husband are living in Houston, Texas.
128	I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there.
128	In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time.
128	I got tired of that job because of shift work.
128	This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders.
128	I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more.
128	My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens.
128	Right now I am learning about the market, and how it functions.
128	I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in Houston.
128	I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work.
128	We will see how this goes.
128	i have to prepare myself well for the future.
128	That's all on work side.
128	Moving to Houston was quite a change.
128	The weather especially.
128	Right now though the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s.
128	I love it.
128	Koli likes Portland better.
128	Houston is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous.
128	I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school.
128	I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes.
128	I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach.
128	I would love to be a professor.
128	So how are you?
128	How is your wife?
128	Your kids?
128	Is anything new happening?
128	What about your parents in NY?
128	Are they OK from all that has happened?
128	What about OSU?
128	Anything new there?
128	How is prof.
128	Moulton?
128	Say hi to him from me.
128	What about the students?
128	Are you still demanding of them?
128	You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes.
128	We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families.
128	My parents ask me about you all the time.
128	They had the greatest time when they visited me here.
128	well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often.
128	Let me know how thigs are going with you, say hi to your wife from me best wishes, Monika
129	yes please include me in the class.
129	thanks Monika Causholli

136	Shipments of market pulp to China totaled 462,157 tonnes in September, down 0.6% compared with August shipments, according to a report last week by China's Materials Information Center.Despite the month-to-month decline last month, market pulp imports into China year-to-date have climbed 33% vs. the same period last year.
136	From January to September 2001, imports have totaled 3.54 million tonnes, reported China's general administration of customs.
136	This might indicate that the Chinese buyers have plenty of stocks available and might slow down their purchasing patterns.
136	Weak market in the pulp industry continues to push producers into taking further downtime.
136	As expected the bulk of downtime is taken by the Canadian producers who face the highest producing costs.
136	Today NorskeCanada announced it will take additional curtailment at all four of its BC pulp and paper divisions during the fourth quarter to reflect the continuing difficult market conditions.The company said it will curtail paper production by 60,000 tonnes (including 38,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp production by 23,600 tonnes in the fourth quarter.
136	Fourth quarter curtailment brings accumulated total paper curtailment for 2001 to 166,000 tonnes (including 112,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp curtailment to 121,000 tonnes.
137	Sorry Nyree.
137	No exceptions.
137	Monika
138	Amy, You could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world.
138	I remember that in the RISI conference the speakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers.
138	Anyways, you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website.
138	Let me know because I have some printed copies too.
138	Monika
139	When is the next derivatives II class offered?
139	thanks, Monika Causholli
140	Hello Karen, Attached is the market wrap for this week.
140	Thanks, Monika
141	In September North American paper demand continued to fall.
141	This is not positive news for the paper and pulp industry.
141	The following is what PPPC released: North American printing/writing paper inventories dropped by about 6% from August to the end of September, but shipments, production, and demand stayed depressed from year-ago levels.
141	Total North American printing/writing production was down 11.0% in September compared with a year ago, to 2.091 million tonnes, PPPC reported.
141	Total shipments were off 9.9% to 2.224 million tonnes.
141	Total inventories decreased 133,000 tonnes from August to September to 2.145 million tonnes and were 313,000 tonnes or 12.7% lower than in September last year.
141	The industry overall operating rate (shipments to capacity) in September was 84%, down from 88% in August and down from 96% a year ago.
141	Uncoated free-sheet accounted for most of the inventory drop, according to September statistics released yesterday by the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal.
141	North American demand was down 10.2% in September to 1.038 million tonnes Coated free-sheet (woodfree) demand was down 11.2% in September while coated groundwood (mechanical) papers demand was off 7.5%, PPPC reported.
142	Karen, Can you please take a look at the revised version and let me know?
142	thanks, Monika
143	I want to register.
143	thanks, Monika Causholli

147	Hello Karen, Please find attached Chile's capacity and its expansion projects.
147	Note that: 1- Arauco's Constitucion mill might have another alternative capacity of 360,000 tons a year.
147	I was confused because in their annual report the capacity is mentioned many times, each time different numbers.
147	Can I get your input on this.
147	We can discuss it when you have time.
147	2- There is one modernization project that will increase the capacity of Pacifico mill (CMPC) that will come online on Q1 2003.
147	I did not apply any percentage rate for the project implementation.
147	PLease advise me if I need to do that plus the rates I should use.
147	3- The projects in red are not impelemented yet and PPPC does not look very optimistic for those.
147	4-Sheet 1 of the spread sheet contains the mills' capacities from Jacobs Sirrine which are not far off from the capacities I found in the annual reports.
147	Let me know if I need to work and improve this further.
147	Finally, I had a lot of fun working on this project :) Monika
148	Hello, The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week.
148	FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02.
148	In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).
148	Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices.
148	The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase instead of US$20-30 as previously announced.
148	Still price increases are expected to continue in November.
148	Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.
148	Thanks, Monika Causholli ext.
148	5-1510
149	Maybe I should rephrase it: What I was trying to say there was that producers are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in November in line with what they have announced.
149	Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.
149	thanks for the feedback though.
149	It helps a lot.
149	Monika

161	thanks, Monika
162	thank you!
163	Dave, As PPPC explains in the attached file the reason for the low levels of inventory was because the consumer inventories had reached such a low level (below normal) throughout the whole year that now consumers are rebuilding the stocks.

171	Hello Jim, I was glad to hear back from you.
171	So you are going to be a grandpa soon.
171	That's great news!
171	Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice.
171	I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security.
171	My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was bought from another company.
171	I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships.
171	I am looking into all of those.
171	It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school.
171	I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance.
171	I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed.
171	I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.
171	If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can?
171	I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now.
171	In addition, if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too.
171	Thanks Jim, Monika
172	Karen, Here is my resume.

173	I appreciate your help a lot.
173	This whole thing with my company happened so fast and caught me off guard.- a lesson for next time-.
173	Anyways please continue to keep in touch.
173	I will do the same and keep you posted.

180	Jim, I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing.
180	In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me.
180	The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.

3	How does it work now?
4	Steve Hall is contacting Al Paske regarding the transmission contract.
4	Apparently they have already been discussing this issue.
5	Stewart, I left you an envelope with information regarding the City of K. Falls.
5	Not sure if you forwarded it to anyone to begin the process for credit approval.
5	Can you please respond to Ray's E-mail?
5	Let me know if there is something else you need me to do.
6	FYI.....
7	Hey what's the scoop on this?
8	I went into Scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out.
8	I'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry.
8	I believe these should synchronize, or they read off of one another.
8	??
9	not that we have much equity in our 401 anymore, but we may need to look at which fund to invest in.
10	Paul, Put me down for a 21" and a 19" if there's availability.
11	FYI
12	Lynn, Who can I talk to regarding my password to get into the TSIN site?

13	Vicky, Thank you again for you assistance with this process.
13	As you requested, this is our notification to PG&E of our purchase from the City of Shasta Lake of their COTP Transmission Capacity bi-directionally.
13	The term of the deal will include the months of November and December 2001.
13	Also as you requested, I faxed the Confirmation Notice between Shasta and EPMI to your office.
13	I have listed my office number below if you have any further questions.
13	Thanks again, Diana Scholtes Enron West Trading
14	O.K.!
14	Just to keep you appraised of what I'm doing, I have left a message with Bob Sullivan @ CISO and I spoke to WAPA.
14	I think the call to WAPA was just to notify them that they won't be managing Shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal.
14	I'm going to be working with Bob Sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes.
14	Not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that?
14	You can update Gerry though, for me.
14	I appreciate your help!
14	Thanks Diana
15	Wonder what their nomination will be for Nov?
15	Thanks Diana

35	Hi!
35	It has been a long time!
35	As you know things here are very shaky.
35	I can't believe the big E has crumbled!
35	Who would have ever guessed!
35	Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.
35	I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!
35	And we need to!
35	I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon.
35	So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.
35	Any chance of you and Mark coming down?
35	We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.
35	I love your house!
35	Thanks for sending the picture.
35	Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!
35	I'm glad I'm done!
35	It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!
35	Its very strange, but what to do?
35	Natalie, I can't believe is 3!
35	And a very terrible 3.
35	My hands are full!
35	I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.
35	She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.
35	Ask Mark for me if this is too young.
35	She won't think so, its mostly my fear.
35	=3D) You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.
35	One of them is my depiction a young Penny Lane.
35	Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!
35	You'll also notice the Beagle that Bill bought for Natalie.
35	HAHA!
35	His name is Presley.
35	She's absolutely in love with him.

50	Anne, There seems to still be a problem with a couple of days.
50	I'm not sure if you've made the changes after sending me this detail.
50	If not here's the list of problems that I see: 3/14 Purchases(ours)- To PCW-EPMI(PGE Sys) 142mw priced at 177.17 and it should be @ $177.77.
50	Total= $895,776.78 3/17 Remember this is the day that should look exactly like the 16th purchases (ours).
50	3/18 On our sales to you....the MPC-EPMI Colstrip you have it priced @ $370.
50	This should be @ $343.85...
50	Total for March Purchases: $22,387,004.05 Sales: $22,250,089.59
51	Virginia, We match for March.
51	If you can inform whoever it is that's still here so we can follow thru our billing.
51	We are now working on August.
51	Thanks,
52	Here we go!!!!
52	My Purchases: 8/9 To BPA-EPMI(PWX) 51 mw should be priced at 70.72 and not 70.22 Total= $433,054.06 8/17 Looks like your missing the park/lending deal [150 peak @41.21; 100 off @ 31.39] Total=$269,516.56 8/18 Same as the 17th.
52	Total= 267,475.56 Once these are fixed I'm good on the purchase side.
52	Will be working on my sales to you next!
52	thanks
53	FYI
54	Amy, I have forward this to Sean Crandall to help you settle.
54	I will be out of the office for the balance of the year.
54	Thanks, Diana Scholtes
55	What we are looking at is cleaning up for December.
55	So the schedule strips have already been created.
55	For settlement purposes, we have to go in and clean house.
55	So it wouldn't help to change the deal in Deal Entry and I'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation.
55	So we are looking at a time strip for example Dec 8-31 to zero out "Counter party".
55	I will be talking to John tomorrow morning to find out more about the West Bankruptcy book.
55	Don't know anything about it.
55	Thanks again, Diana
56	Will, Can you tell me what day was the last to be rolled in Auto Scheduler?
56	I'm trying to go back into December to balance Enpower for Settlement purposes.
56	Thank you, Diana Scholtes
57	Hello John!
57	I appreciate the recommendation, but I am not in the position right now to make a move.
57	If they are interested in discussing a position here in the NW, I would be more interested in that.
57	I hope everything is going well for you.
57	Keep in touch!
57	Diana
58	Michael, I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.
58	So I apologize, I haven't been in town.
58	Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.
58	Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.
58	If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.
58	You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).
58	I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.
58	Thank you for your time.
58	Hope your holidays were good.
58	Regards, Diana Scholtes
59	Leslie, I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.
59	My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?
59	We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.
59	I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.
59	I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.
59	If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.
59	Diana Scholtes West Desk

62	I talked to Arvina this morning and she noticed that she has calculated the loss return using the wrong indicies.
62	She will be fixing that this morning.
62	I am attaching a summary of the loss return calculation and a quick summary of checking I did against Arvina spreadsheet.
62	There is a deal that we entered in differently, but the net result is the same.

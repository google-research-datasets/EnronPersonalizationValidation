0	Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching a memo that I prepared in April, 2000 regarding procedures for opening brokerage accounts.
0	Please do not hesitate to contact either Sara at x35620 or me with any questions.
1	Hi, Bianca!
1	Francisco Pinto Leite has asked me to give him a list of all outstanding ISDAs and Deemed ISDAs with Mexican counterparties.
1	Can you send me a list of the Deemed ISDAs that are still outstanding (either comments received or counterparty has not returned signed copy).
1	Thanks!
1	Marie
2	Esmeralda: I'm available.
2	Thanks!
2	Marie
3	I'm just now going through my e-mails from last week as I was out cleaning up after the flood.
3	I had given Cynthia the omnibus forms before I left, so I don't know what they are doing/not doing up there.
3	Marie
4	WHAT????????
4	How can this be?
4	Who allowed this to happen?
4	What are we going to do?
4	There is no one worthy to take your place as favorite credit person.
4	Those structuring people can't possibly be nicer than us.
4	I guess I wish you well, although it's going to be bad for us.
4	Oh, as far as the HUGE Happy Hour, I hope you aren't getting your hopes up too high.
4	Remember, it's Bill!
4	Seriously, we will miss you and I wish you all the best.
4	Marie
5	Hi, Bernice!
5	I don't think Legal needs to review your correspondence requesting this information, but we will still need to receive copies of the name changes, mergers, etc. Thanks!
5	Marie
6	Susan: Attached are Frank's hedge fund forms.
6	The first one is a blackline and the second one is the actual form.
7	Below are Tidewater's comments to the omnibus confirmation.
7	Please let me know what changes are acceptable.
7	Thanks!
7	Marie
8	Tracy: Will you handle this?
8	Thanks!
8	Marie
9	Tiffany: Attached is the revised Annex B for the omnibus confirmation.
9	We have addressed the counterparty's concerns as follows: 1.
9	Annual vs. monthly financial statements - the annex provides for delivery of annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements.
9	It does not require delivery of monthly financial statements.
9	2.
9	We have revised Annex B to be 2- way, meaning that the provisions apply to both the counterparty and ENA.
9	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
9	Marie
10	Fred: I am passing this e-mail along to Tracy Cooper.
10	I am no longer with EBS and Tracy is the paralegal who took my place, so she will be assisting you on preparing master agreements.
10	Hope all is well!
10	Marie
11	Gentlemen: Pursuant to Jarrod Cyprow's request, I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of your form Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex, which reflect our comments to such forms.
11	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.
11	We look forward to hearing your comments.
11	Thank you.
12	Tracy: Look in the closing binder (the BMC binders) were on your file cabinets.
12	The side letter should be in there.
12	Marie
13	Mike: Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching a draft form of Collateral and Exposure Provisions (two way cash only) for the Citibank transactions.
13	Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

14	Thanks!
14	Marie

18	Please contact Sara with any questions or comments.
18	Thanks!
19	Ed: Attached are the following: 1.
19	ConEd's form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 and 2.
19	Our comparison of the above documents.
19	Please review the following credit related items and let me know if you are okay with ConEd's language or if you would prefer our revision: 1.
19	Part 1(c) - "Cross Default" - ConEd has left in the provision re cross acceleration, which we usually take out, but leave in if our counterparty is a financial institution.
19	2.
19	Part 1(d) - "Credit Event Upon Merger" - will you agree to ConEd's language?
19	Also, I know you said that we were just going to comment on ConEd's version without credit, but Sara wanted to know if you want to include cross-default thresholds and the same matrix we are using in the two specific transactions.
19	Please let me have your response to the above as soon as possible so that we can send our comments to ConEd, as they are getting pretty agitated that we are taking so long.
19	Thanks!
19	Marie
20	Hi, Jay: It's your friendly pest AGAIN!!!!!!!!
20	Do you have an address for me for Southern California and have you found out anything about "Petro-Hunt L.L.C."
20	and "Petro-Hunt Corporation being the same entity? Thanks! Marie
21	Attached for your review are the revised Citibank/ENA and Delta/ENA confirmations.
21	I am attaching only clean copies as the compare documents note all changes, not just the ones made today.
21	Thanks!
21	Marie
22	Pretty impressive!
23	Here are the revised confirms.
23	Thanks!
23	Marie
24	Oops!
24	I was supposed to tell you that Sara is working on the Enron Corp. guaranty so we should have them to you shortly.
25	Mr. Bicker: Pursuant to Frank Sayre's request, I am attaching a clean and blacklined copy of the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with the draft Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, which drafts incorporate the latest comments and revisions.
25	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.

27	Attached are the revised draft confirms.
27	Marie
28	Pursuant to Jason Williams' request, I am attaching our draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with a draft Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
28	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
29	Craig: Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet for Petro-Hunt, L.L.C.
29	on 6/24.
29	There was a question regarding this entity, which Jay had answered by Petro-Hunt on 6/27.
29	I have drafted the master and once it has been reviewed by a lawyer, I will send it on to Liz Luthans.
29	Marie
30	Hi, Holly!
30	The only exceptions I have were Monday and Tuesday, June 18 and 19 were vacation days.
30	Thanks!
30	Marie
31	Michael: Here they are!
31	I will send you copies of the pre-printed ISDA Credit Support Annex to attach to the hard copies.
31	Let me know if you need anything else.
31	Marie
32	Kristina: Pursuant to our conversation, attached is the form of Consent and Assignment for execution by Enron North America Corp. in connection with the natural gas and basis swaps to be assigned to Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. As I stated, our credit department is verifying the transactions being assigned so once I receive information from them, we will contact you with any questions or comments.
32	Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.
32	Thanks!
33	Kristina: My CompareRite feature is not working right now, but I can point out the changes we made.
33	The changes we made were to the final revised form that Carol St. Clair prepared, so for the most part, the changes are the same as hers with these exceptions: 1.
33	Preamble - "Enron Power Marketing, Inc."
33	has been changed to "Enron North America Corp., formerly known as Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".
33	2.
33	First "WHEREAS" paragraph - "WHEREAS, ....identified on Exhibits A and B hereto (whether one or more referred to herein collectively as the "Transactions"), under the ISDA Master Agreement dated May 14, 1998...;".
33	3.
33	Second "WHEREAS" paragraph - changed "a" to "an" before "Assignment Agreement dagted April 25, 2001".
33	4.
33	Paragraph 3 - changed "Consent and Assignment" to "Consent to Assignment".
33	5.
33	Paragraph 8 - "As of...that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1992...".
33	6.
33	Signature Line changed from "Enron Power Marketing, Inc."
33	to "Enron North America Corp., formerly known as Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".
33	7.
33	Added Exhibit A (Natural Gas Transactions) and Exhibit B (Basis Swaps).
33	If my CompareRite starts working, I'll try to send you a blacklined copy.
33	Marie
34	I spoke with Frank about your proposed changes and he was okay with your first change, however, the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear in Section 5(c)(i).
34	What documentation sets forth your investment objectives, restrictions, etc.?
34	Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA?
34	Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal opinion.
34	Thank you for your assistance.
35	Anthony: There's not a form of assignment attached.
35	The attachment is your Overseas Securities Lending Agreement.
35	Marie
36	I guess it would help if I attached the documents.
36	Sorry!
36	Here they are.
37	Becky: I didn't have anything for her, so I can't complete the review form.
37	Marie
38	Francisco: Here is the CA for Procter & Gamble Manufactura.
38	Marie
39	Joe: Please update the attached list and forward to Jay Williams and me.
39	Thanks!
39	Marie
40	Dan: Attached are clean and blackline drafts of the ISDA Master Agreement noting your changes to Parts 5(b)(g)-"Eligibility" and 5(p)-"Additional Definitions".
40	If the attached revisions are acceptable, we should be in a position to finalize execution documents.
40	Did your lawyer have any comments to the guaranty forms?
40	Thanks!
40	Marie
41	Anthony: Attached for your review are clean and blacklined copies of your form of assignment, which note our comments.
41	Please let me know if the attached changes are acceptable.
41	The only outstanding issue on our executing the new OSLA in favor of Morgan Stanley Securities Limited is our review of the Borrower's warranties which were not a part of the OSLA we executed with Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited.
41	Thanks!
41	Marie
42	Samantha: Can you let Banu know the status of the CA?
42	Thanks!
42	Marie
43	Hi, Jaime: Attached are the revised draft ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13, reflecting the counterparty's collateral threshold to be "$7,000,000" rather than "$5,000,000".
43	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
43	Marie
44	Janelle: As a condition to ENA entering into any new transactions with ConEd, Credit is requiring that ConEd execute the Amendment to Confirmation for Deal No. 514094.01 (to make sure both deals have identical credit).
44	Should you enter into a transaction with ConEd, and they haven't signed the amendment to the existing transaction, the new transaction may have to be unwound.
44	Please let us know if you have any questions.
44	Thanks!
44	Marie
45	Hi, Aparna!
45	Please copy me on e-mails forwarding credit worksheets as I am responsible for assigning them to the paralegals.
45	Thanks!
45	Marie
46	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!
46	We've been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "Babies Elliott" had arrived.
46	Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size, and that Mom is doing well.
46	Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones.
46	I know you all are going to have so much fun with them.
46	Hope you've been storing up sleep, cause it looks like you won't be getting much for a while.
46	Again, congratulations.
46	These three little ones don't realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad, but I'm sure they'll find out soon.
46	Take care Marie
47	Hi, Cindy!
47	Attached is a memo requesting the referenced Enron Corp. guaranty.
47	Also attached are forms of certificates to be signed by Kate Cole.
47	Please note that one of the certificates requires the inclusion of articles of incorporation and bylaws.
47	Please call me when the documents are ready and I'll have someone pick them up.
47	Thanks for your help!
47	Marie
48	Our group is going out for lunch today.
48	I'm free tomorrow and maybe Friday.
49	Carol: Please copy me on e-mails forwarding credit worksheets to Legal.
49	It's now my turn to assign the worksheets among the paralegals.
49	Thanks!
49	Marie
50	Thursday works for me!
51	I'll see y'all at 11:30 unless I hear otherwise.
52	I sure did!
52	thanks!
53	Jarrod: I have checked our database and here is what I found: Clorox - nothing has happened since you contacted them in May and they said they would send it in a few weeks.
53	Nestle - nothing since we sent them a revised draft in July, 1998.
53	Let us know if you want us to follow up with them.
53	Marie
54	I did locate our comments to Nestle's form of schedule originally drafted for Nestle Holdings, Inc., which they revised to reflect Nestle USA, Inc. These comments were delivered to Ed Quinn on 5/21/99 to deliver to Nestle.
54	To our knowledge, nothing has happened since.
55	I received a voice mail from George Diskin today and he would like to schedule a conference call on either August 6 or August 7 at either 12:00 or 1:00 (Houston time).
55	Will you let me know what will work for each of you so that I can coordinate with George.
55	Thanks!
55	Marie
56	Holly: I had vacation time on July 5, 6 and 9.
56	Thanks!
56	Marie
57	Hi, Cindy!
57	Attached are a memo requesting the referenced Enron Corp. guaranty, together with a form of Certificate of Incumbency.
57	Please let me know when the documents are ready and I'll send someone to pick them up.
57	Thanks!
57	Marie
58	Hope this reaches you this time.
58	Marie
59	That's fine.
59	I'll direct the comments to the appropriate individuals.
59	Marie
60	Francisco has requested that anytime we email a Deemed ISDA for a Mexican counterparty to the Confirm Desk, we ask them to return a copy, signed by the counterparty, to us as soon as they receive it back.
60	When we receive the signed copy, we should give it to Francisco.
60	Thanks!
60	Marie
61	We have received the following executed financial Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: July 10, 2001 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: Quark Power LLC Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: Foreign Exchange Confirming Entity: Enron North America Corp. Choice of Law: New York Copies will be distributed.
62	It's hard to say "Quark".
62	I want to call it "Quack".
63	(A) "Independent Amount" means with respect to a party, the amount specified as such for that party in each Confirmation, or if no amount is specified, zero.
63	[(A) "Independent Amount" means with respect to Party A, the amount specified as such for Party A in each Confirmation, or if no amount is specified, zero and means with respect to Party B, the amount calculated as follows: on any Business Day, Party A shall have the right to adjust the Independent Amount due from Party B due to changes in the volatility of relevant markets or of Party B's portfolio of transactions with Party A ("Party B's Portfolio").
63	Party A will calculate such Independent Amount based on its internal Value at Risk ("VAR") calculation for up to ten (10) days of VAR with respect to Party B's Portfolio, provided, however, that in no event shall Party B's Independent Amount be less than $250,000 if there are any outstanding transactions.]
64	Bianca: Attached for your further handling are the Deemed ISDA for Total International Limited, together with a fax cover page.
64	Please let us know when you receive the signed Deemed ISDA back and whether or not the counterparty returns the documentation requested in the fax cover page.
64	If you have any questions, please give me a call.
64	Thanks!
64	Marie
65	The conference call with Consolidated Edison has been scheduled for Monday, August 6 at 1:00 in Sara's office (EB3801A).
65	Please let me know if something comes up that you will not be able to attend so that I can inform George Diskin at ConEd.
65	Thanks!
65	Marie
66	Well, it's about time!
67	I just spoke to Anne and we decided that we would suffer and go eat supper with you and Mama tomorrow night, so we guess we'll just see y'all at Mass and then decide where to go.
67	Me
68	Regarding your e-mail asking us to prepare a confidentiality agreement, below is an e-mail from Tana Jones forwarding two forms of CAs to Credit so that you all can prepare your CAs requesting financials without having to ask Legal to prepare it.
68	The CA must be initialed by a lawyer prior to signing by either Bill or Rick, and a copy of the fully executed CA must be sent to Kay Young in Legal.
68	Let us know if you have any questions.
68	Marie
69	Joe: Attached is the Annex B for each of Wexford Spectrum Investors LLC and Solitair Corp. As I stated in my voicemail, please do not send these out until you get the okay from either Frank Sayre or me.
69	We are waiting to receive the underlying documentation from Caroline Abramo re eligibility, etc. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
69	Marie
70	Tony: Attached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.
70	I don't know if Sara told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.
70	Presently, our resolutions reflect Cassandra Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of Enron Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have Rick Buy be our second signature.
70	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
70	Marie
71	Jim: Attached is the form of confidentiality agreement that Sara made reference to in her voice mail.
71	Thanks!
71	Marie
72	I hope to have the signed guaranty today.
72	All the Enron Corp. officers authorized to sign guaranties were out the latter part of last week, so the Legal Department was going to have to find someone today to sign the guaranties.
72	As soon as I receive it, I will fax it to you and send the original, together with the other documents to you by overnight courier.
72	Marie
73	Hi, Tanya!
73	Jay said that he has passed AK Steel along to you to look at.
73	I told him that I thought things were passed down the chain, not up and he said that when you are as good as he his, they are passed up the chain.
73	You may have something different to say about this.
73	Anyway, Chris Motley at AK is calling checking on the status of the ISDA.
73	We originally were going to have it signed, but when Samantha called Jay about initialling, he said Credit wanted to revisit the credit, so can you let me know the status so that I can tell Chris?
73	Thanks!
73	Marie
74	I was wondering who Miguel was and now I know.
75	In connection with Tana Jones' e-mail of July 12, 2001, I am attaching revised forms of the Credit Confidentiality Agreements for use in requesting financial statements from a counterparty.
75	Please begin using the attached forms when preparing confidentiality agreements and please refer to Tana's e-mail regarding procedures for preparing and signing the agreements.
75	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at x33907.
76	Hi, Gordon!
76	Will you send us a copy of the termination when it is sent to Grupo MINSA?
76	Thanks!
76	Marie
77	Hi, Diane!
77	I just sent Gordon this e-mail asking him to send us a copy of the termination when sent to Grupo MINSA and received his "out of office" reply.
77	Will you or whoever prepares the termination send a copy to me?
77	Thanks!
77	Marie
78	Just cc: us on the copy.
78	Thanks!
79	My location is EB3803B, company number is 0413, and cost center is 105657.
80	Holly: I don't remember if I told you the specific date that my jury duty has been rescheduled to, but if not, it's now scheduled for Friday, September 28.
80	Thanks!
80	Marie
81	Hi, Candace: Yes, I have received the document and will do my best to get it signed today and returned to you by fax.
81	Thanks!
81	Marie
82	Max: I will get the amendment to you today.
82	Marie
83	Credit has been instructed that either Rick Buy or Bill can sign the CA's.
83	Since these were strictly for financials (and signed by Enron Corp.), we weren't going to enter them into our database, but Kay Young is going to keep a copy in her files.
83	Do you have any suggestions or comments otherwise?
84	Max: Per our conversation, attached is the draft First Amendment to Master Agreement.
84	If these changes are acceptable to the counterparty, they can either sign two originals and send to us for signature or, we can sign first and then forward to them.
84	If they have any questions, they can call either Frank Sayre (x57894) or me (x33907).
84	Thanks!
84	Marie
85	Agustin: Per Francisco's request, I am attaching the clean and blacklined draft of the ISDA Master Agreement for Fersinsa.
85	Let us know if you need anything else.
85	Marie
86	Joe: Attached for your further handling is a "sample" confirm.
86	Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
86	Marie
87	I'll take care of this.
87	Sara and I were expecting these documents.
87	Thanks!
87	Marie
88	Ms. Marquez: Attached are an original and blacklined copy of your form of guaranty, which reflect our comments.
88	Please do not hesitate to contact either Francisco Pinto-Leite, Senior Counsel (713/345-7942; francisco.pinto.leite@enron.com) or me with any questions or comments.
88	Thank you for your assistance.
89	Mr. Boytinck: Pursuant to Jason Biever's request, I am attaching, for your review, a draft Master Agreement between Garden City Plaza Ltd. and Enron Canada Corp. Please do not hesitate to contact either Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel (713/853-3448; anne.koehler@enron.com) or me with any questions or comments.
89	We look forward to hearing your comments.
90	The ADM/Carr Futures Give-Up has been signed by fax and the ADM/Goldman Sachs & Co. Give-Up has also been signed by fax.
90	The ADM/Goldman Sachs International Give-Up won't be signed until the GSI agreement that Sara is working on has been signed.
90	Marie
91	Brant: Richard Friedman in Bill Berkeland's group would like to send a draft ISDA to Citgo Petroleum Corporation.
91	According to Lotus Notes, we sent them a draft in July, 1997.
91	Will you prepare a worksheet and send to us so that we can send Citgo a current draft?
91	If you aren't the right credit contact, will you pass this e-mail along?
91	Thanks!
91	Marie
92	Richard: When I open your attachment, all that's there are characters that I can't decipher.
92	Can you resend me the contact information for Citgo?
92	Thanks!
92	Marie
93	Hi, Gennaro!
93	I'm trying to pull all these documents together so that we can have them re-executed and I noticed that the Euroclear single Pledgor Pledge Agreement attached is not the same version we signed.
93	The version we signed in RG500b(Pledgee's Representative version - 1998 Edition).
93	Do you have this version that you can send to me?
93	Thanks!
94	Laurel: Can you help me respond to Susan's e-mail?
94	I think her question is did the below transaction remain on ECT's US books or was it back to backed with the UK?
94	I think there is a tax question.
94	Thanks!
94	Marie
95	No, I haven't heard anything and yes, I will let you know when I do.
96	Okey dokey.
97	Sheila: We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized Cassandra to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get Kate Cole in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for Cassandra.
97	Cassandra has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of Enron Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.
97	This will be resolved at the Enron Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.
97	Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.
97	Marie
98	Hi, Wendi!
98	Attached is a form of multiparty/multiproduct guaranty that we would like for a counterparty to provide to us.
98	I checked with Tana and she said that this is the form we would use whether EOL or verbal transactions.
98	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
98	Marie
99	It's Rob Cass.
100	I'll take a look at it and run it by one of the other lawyers.
101	I checked and Sara sent a message to Credit on 3/26/01 but obviously has had no response.
101	You may want to respond to Mr. Martin and let him know that Sara did receive his message and that we were waiting on our Credit Department to respond and we will send them (Credit) another reminder that we are waiting to hear from them.
102	Tanya: Sara received a request from FPL's outside counsel in March asking to execute an ISDA for the entity that trades for the non-regulated business units of the regulated entity, Florida Power & Light Co. He is offering the guaranty of FPL Group Capital Inc. Sara sent a copy of her Lotus Notes entry to you all asking someone to respond.
102	Today, she received another e-mail re status?
102	Russell worked on the Florida Power & Light Co. master.
102	Do you know who is or will be working on this, assuming it is something we want to do?
102	Thanks!
102	Marie
103	Kim: I have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ENA corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions.
103	Mary Cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to Brenda Herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify Legal of any changes.
103	In this e-mail, apparently Brenda asked that Mike Moscoso's and Kristen Hanson's appointments be revoked and that Lisa McClendon be added.
103	Will you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time?
103	Thanks!
103	Marie
104	I already did.
105	Thanks!
106	YES!!!!!
106	I have to get money.
107	No problem.
107	I'll get them to you shortly.
108	Kim: We are in the process of cleaning this mess up.
108	Sally Beck and Rogers Herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ENA, so they can already sign documents.
108	Go figure!
108	If it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then I can double check against my list.
108	I don't want to remove someone who should be left, nor do I want to leave someone on who should be removed.
108	Thanks for your help.
108	P.S.
108	For timing purposes, we are shooting for Monday to finalize documentation.

119	Jay: Here is the e-mail I received from SoCal.
119	I haven't looked at their form, as I don't think we want to play the forms game with them.
119	If you want me to, I'll touch base with her to see how she is coming with commenting on our form.
119	Let me know.
119	Marie
120	Joe Hunter said he sent an interoffice envelope sometime last week (he doesn't remember who he sent it to) containing copies of a confirm on the J Aron website, together with a copy of a Service Agreement.

127	Can you give me a call?

130	Thanks!
130	Marie
131	Have a great weekend!
131	Does this mean you won't be sending us anymore worksheets today?
132	Robbi: I left you a voice mail on Friday.
132	I looked at the UEComm Master and had some comments--such as our name is wrong, the cross default threshold for us should be US $ and not AUD, and there were a few other questions I had.
132	Marie
133	Reminder: Conference Call with ConEd at 1:00 today in Sara's office - EB3801A.

134	Marie
135	Here's info on the Elliotts.
135	Marie
136	Rebecca: I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.
136	I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer.
136	Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp. likes their resolutions drafted than we are.
136	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
136	Marie
137	Ms. Marquez: I am following up regarding the status of our comments to the form of guaranty for Pemex that you provided to Lucy Ortiz.

139	Yolanda: In connection with the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement with GAF Refining LLC, Section 3 requires that they provide the following documentation: 1.
139	IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number) 2.
139	Certificate of Incumbency certifying (i) a true and correct copy of the certificate of organization or formation and operating agreement and (ii) the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of the sole member/manager of GAF Refining.

139	I am attaching forms of the certificates listed as items 2 and 3 above.
139	If GAF needs the IRS W-9, they can go to their website at www.irs.gov and download a copy.
139	ENA will be providing a Certificate of Incumbency, certifying its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of ENA, together with a Certificate certifying resolutions as to its authority to enter into financial transactions and an IRS W-9.
139	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
139	Marie
140	I finally remembered to send this to you.
141	Hi, Paul!
141	I am attaching clean and blacklined drafts of the Master Agreements for each of Catequil Partners, L.P. and Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd. Please review and let us know of any changes we should make before sending them to Catequil.
141	Thanks!
141	Marie
142	Pat: Attached for your further handling are a clean and blacklined draft of the Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. and Uecomm Operations Pty Limited.
142	I blacklined my draft against the draft that David prepared since I didn't have a clean copy of Uecomm's comments.
142	Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
142	Marie
143	Pat: Attached for your further handling is the revised Master Agreement deleting the "eligible contract participant" rep.
143	Marie
144	Tanya: I don't remember if I forwarded this on or not.
144	When we receive counterparties' paper, should we forward on to you or would you prefer we send them to Jay or someone else?
144	Marie
145	I think it will be okay for them to sign.
145	They will need to print and sign two originals and return both copies to you.
145	Both David and John will need to initial before the agreements can be signed by an authorized officer.
145	Additionally, our notice information will need to be completed.
145	Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the Enron Corp. guaranty or will David process it from your end?
145	Also, I don't know if you will keep the original in Australia or if it will come back to Houston.
145	Robbi, do you know?
145	We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed.
145	Hope this isn't too confusing!
145	Marie
146	Tracy: Can you send the latest long haul SLAs to Pat since I don't have access to them.
146	If you're not sure which ones to send, check with Robbi.
146	Thanks!
146	Marie
147	Okay.
148	I don't blame you.
148	Obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it, not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and I don't think she wants to learn.
148	That was pretty obvious when I was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job, otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work.
149	Celeste: I guess there's no credit?
149	Marie
150	I'm working on the guarantees now, so I should have the draft to a lawyer today.
151	Here it is.
152	Hi, Ken!
152	I just received a call from Chris Croom who wants to send an updated ISDA draft to Avery Dennison Corp. Can we use the same credit, or do you want to revise it?
152	He said he was going to meet with the counterparty on Tuesday, so I'm sure he either wants them to get the draft before then or he will take it with him.
152	Thanks!
152	Marie
153	I don't know off the top of my head where they are?
153	Is there a blue file?
153	Do I have a memo in my memo directory where I sent them to Contract Admin?
154	Wayne: I went to Tracy's office to help Cynthia look for the documents and Cynthia found them, so you should be getting copies shortly.
154	Marie
155	Hi, Anna!
155	I apologize for not calling you today, but things got pretty hectic and I misplaced your message.
155	Besides the termination of the Enron Corp. guaranty guaranteeing obligations of Enron North America Corp., please provide me with a list of the corporate certificates you need.
155	This will help me in having everything signed that you need.
155	Thanks!
155	Marie
156	Tracy: Can you get Wayne copies of the Into Networks confirm and GTC?
156	They are in the blue Into file in your bottom file drawer.
156	Thanks!
157	Mr. Lopez-Velarde: Pursuant to our conversation attached is the form of guaranty that one of our business groups would like to send to a Mexican counterparty.
157	Francisco has asked if you would please revise the guaranty to provide for agent for service of process, submission to governing law in Texas and submission to jurisdiction in U.S. courts in Texas.
157	It appears that the form includes submission to jurisdiction in Texas and I have included a provision regarding agent for service of process.
157	As I stated, we would like to have these revisions as soon as possible this afternoon.
157	Thank you for your assistance.
157	Marie
158	Celeste: We are reviewing ISDA opinions to verify if a Hong Kong entity can enter into derivative transactions.
158	Once we confirm that they can, we will send the form Deemed ISDA to you.
158	Marie
159	Hi, Jay!
159	Just received a call from Adam at XTO Energy and he is going to be sending an e-mail with their comments to the ISDA.
159	He said there were just a handful, but we'll see.
159	I'll forward his e-mail to you when I receive it.
159	Have a good weekend!
159	Marie
160	Here are XTO's comments.
160	Please respond to those that are credit related, which appear to be most of them.
160	Lucky you!
160	Thanks!
160	Marie
161	Hi, Joe: Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.
161	Let me know if this is not the case.
161	Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.
161	Thanks for your help.
161	Marie
162	Attached for your further handling is the Annex B for the related transaction.
162	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
162	Marie
163	I'm preparing the Master Agreement for execution between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. and the referenced counterparty.
163	Please let me know the date of the earliest outstanding trade (if any) so that I can date my master agreement.
163	Thanks!
163	Marie
164	Mr. Sill Pursuant to your request, attached is the execution copy of the Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte.
164	Ltd. and Uecomm Operations Pty Limited.
164	Please print two (2) copies of the document and have an authorized officer sign both copies on Page 6 of the agreement.
164	When executed, please forward both original signed copies by overnight courier to Mr. David Minns at Level 21, 9 Castlereagh St., Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia, Telephone No. (612) 9229 2310 I will process the Enron Corp. Guaranty and will forward it to you when completed.
164	Thank you for your assistance and, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
165	Hi, David: As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.
165	When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.
165	I'm sure Pat can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.
165	In addition, please initial both copies and have John Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in Houston.
165	I am processing the original Enron Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from Enron Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.
165	Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
165	Marie
166	Will you e-mail me your form guaranty?
166	Thanks!
167	Hi, Cindy: I'm assisting EBS in some of their trading work for awhile, so this is why I am sending you the attached memo requesting an Enron Corp. Guaranty.
167	Please let me know when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pick-up.
167	Thanks!
167	Marie
168	Hi, Nidia!
168	Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add "Process Agent" section.
168	Please send this revised form to the counterparty asking that they use this form rather than the form of guaranty you sent them on Friday.
168	Let us know if you have any questions.
168	Thanks!
168	Marie
169	Samantha: Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.
169	He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.
169	I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.
169	Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.
169	Let me know if you have questions or need help.
169	Thanks!
169	Marie
170	Hi, Gordon: We have received the draft ISDA Master Agreement back from Nemak, S.A. which they have executed.
170	It appears to be in order, so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us.
170	The effective date on the agreement is July 30, 2001.
170	We can confirm transactions with them under this Master Agreement.
170	Once ENA has executed the document, I will send the general e-mail to everyone as usual.
170	Let me know if you have any questions.
170	Thanks!
170	Marie
171	Thanks, that's nice to hear!
172	Hi, Tracy!
172	I couldn't remember if I was supposed to send you the final copy of the Schedule and Paragraph 13 or not, so what the heck, here they are!
172	Thanks!
172	Marie
173	Hi, Veronica!
173	Have you had a chance to review their comments?
173	Marie
174	Mark: I am attaching a revised list.
174	I forgot to show EBS, not that is has created a significant amount of work.
174	Thanks!
174	Marie
175	Did you get this?
176	I will be out this Friday, August 17.
177	KINDLY FIND?
177	There's nothing "Kindly" about 4 credit worksheets.
177	In fact, we kindly reject them.
178	Will you gladly look at these four too?
179	Per Legal/Credit meeting.
180	Ed: I just received these from Niagra Mohawk.
180	I don't know if they are the same as the ones I sent to Tanya last week that she said she forwarded on to you to assign.
180	Marie
181	Hi, Joe!
181	Per my voicemail, will you send me the two confirms for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd. I need to make some changes to them.
181	Thanks!
181	Marie
182	Hi, Angie!
182	I am just writing to check on the status of your review of the draft ISDA Master Agreement I forwarded to you.
182	Will you please let me know when you anticipate sending your comments?
182	Thanks!
182	Marie
183	I don't have any exceptions.
183	Thanks!
184	Thanks for your voicemail regarding CT Corporation.
184	My fax number is (713) 646-3490.
184	When I receive the information, I will insert in into the ISDA Master Agreement and will return a fully executed copy to you.
184	Again, thank you for your assistance and attention to this matter.
184	Marie
185	Bob: Mark Taylor said I should forward this to you for review.
185	If this is not the case, please let me know.
185	Thanks!
185	Marie

186	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
186	Marie
187	Alan: Francisco asked me to send you the revised guaranty form.
187	Marie
188	Hi, Maribel: I don't know if you were copied on Tana Jones's e-mail, but Legal is preparing all confidentiality agreements once again, so instead of you having to prepare the agreement, if you will just provide us with the counterparty info (name, address, contact, etc.) we will prepare the CA, have initialled and forward to you for signature.
188	Thanks!
188	Marie
189	Wendi: You don't believe everything Tana tells you, do you?
189	Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work?
189	At least now you know who really does the work in the Swap Group.
189	We will prepare your CA for you (since Tana won't).
189	Will you send Poli-Twine's address and fax number?
189	Thanks!
189	Marie
190	Not a thing!
191	Wendi: Attached for your further handling is the referenced CA.
191	When you receive the signed document from Poli-Twine, please have it initialled by a lawyer before having Bill sign.
191	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
191	Marie
192	I'm okay.
193	Hallelujah!
193	Maybe now we won't go through as much paper as before.
194	Matt: Here is the proposed language re appointing agents and attorneys-in-fact to sign confirmations.
194	We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval, as he approves the trading resolutions.
194	We need to make the appointments effective as of 5/1/01.
194	Also, Bryan Burnett, Edward Ondarza and Stewart Seeligson are with EBS, so I don't know if they are still officers of ENA.
194	Didn't Max Yzaguirre leave Enron altogether?
194	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
194	Thanks!
194	Marie
195	Joe: Attached are a clean and blacklined copy of the Partial Termination.
195	We have revised it to reflect a "new" transaction rather than a "replacement" transaction, since the existing transaction is still in place.
195	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
195	Marie
196	Have you looked into the 4 Peoples-related worksheets that Rudwell sent us to verify if we want to go ahead and draft ISDAs to send to them?
196	Please let us know if we should go ahead and draft or not.
196	Thanks!
196	Marie
197	Thanks!
197	If anyone should apologize for not responding in a timely fashion it should be me.
197	I'll work on preparing these documents and should have something to you soon.
197	Marie
198	Thank you for all your hard work.
198	This is something that has needed to be done, but no one would take the initiative.
198	Let's just hope all your hard work makes it to the datasheet.
198	Thanks!
198	Marie
199	Carol: The only one I found in our database is SMBC Capital Markets.
199	Sara was working on this back in 1998 for Enron Corp. Let me know if you need anything else.
199	Marie
200	Adam: I have passed your comments along to our Credit Department and am waiting for a response.
200	I will touch base with them.
200	Hopefully we can wrap this up soon.
200	Marie
201	Jay: I responded to Adam and told him that our Credit Department was reviewing the comments and that I would check on the status.
201	Marie
202	Ms. Rosenthal: Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA schedule.
202	Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).
202	Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp. guaranty.
202	You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same.
202	Thank you.
203	Hi, Patrick: Can you provide me with the date for Deal No. VT2401.1?
203	Thanks!
203	Marie
204	Hi, Robbi!
204	Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.
204	How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?
204	Hopefully, better.
204	Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.
204	Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark saw right through them.
204	Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.
204	We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.
204	If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.
204	We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.
204	Would you let me know?
204	Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.
204	What is best for you?
204	Talk to you later.
204	Mare
205	Don't worry.
205	That's why we're here--to keep you on your toes.
206	Susan: Sara received this e-mail from First Union regarding the ISDA with Enron Corp. Per Lotus Notes, you are working with Sara on this.
206	Is this something you can handle, or should it wait until Sara returns?
206	Thanks!
206	Marie
207	Celeste: Are there deal terms that the lawyer can use to review the confirm?
207	If not, what are they specifically reviewing?
207	Thanks!
207	Marie
208	Robbi: Friday would be great for us, as long as it's not going to put you in a bind since you are trying to get out for vacation.
208	Also, yes, I would like to look at your catalog.
208	I'm so glad we're bosom buddies!
208	We will offer our painting services to you if you want to do a faux finish at your new home.
208	Marie
209	I just received this e-mail from Todd Perkins at Southern Co.
210	Hi, Cindy: Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of March 29, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing Enron Credit Inc.'s obligations under a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were originally executed by ENA and assigned to Enron Credit Inc. Andy Fastow signed this guaranty.
210	Bear Stearns is now asking for certificates as to authority and incumbency, so I have prepared and attach them for processing.
210	In addition, Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of February 20, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing ENA's obligations under the Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were subsequently assigned to Enron Credit Inc. We asked Bear Stearns to return the original Enron Corp. guaranty and apparently they have lost it.
210	In this regard, I am attaching a form of termination for that guaranty.
210	If it is in order, please process it for signature.
210	Thanks for your help and if you have any questions or need anything else, please let me know.
210	Marie
211	I don't think another e-mail would be rude.
211	It's rude that she hasn't responded to our other requests.
211	Do you want to send it or do you want me to.
211	I'll be happy to.
211	Marie
212	FYI.
212	What's the big deal in CSFB not sending us their form of schedule until we send the form of Enron Corp. guaranty and said that ECT Investments will collateralize its trades?
212	Marie
213	Tanya: You'll love this.
213	ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the "threshold amount" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.
213	I think we are mixing apples and oranges!
213	Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.
213	And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.
213	Marie
214	Mr. Giordano: Attached are the final blacklined drafts of the ISDA Master Agreements for Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd. and Catequil Partners L.P., which incorporate your comments sent to us on 8/22.
214	With respect to "Valuation and Timing", we just inadvertently left that comment in, but have now deleted it.
214	Please let us know if the final comments are acceptable to you and, if so, we will finalize copies for execution.
214	Thanks!
215	Oops, sorry!
216	Thanks, Veronica.
216	Brent Hendry is going to call you about Todd Perkins' e-mail.
216	We don't want to enter into an ISDA with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters.
216	Brent will call Todd and tell him that we will either enter into 6 separate masters or one master with Southern and then they can internally back to back trades.
216	So, I would not do anything until Brent speaks with you and Todd.
216	Marie
217	Oops, sorry!
217	Here they are!
217	Marie
218	Great!
218	Hopefully, we will be able to sign them up soon.
218	Thanks!
218	Marie
219	We can look at your documents, however, we are unable to open the one you have sent previously.
219	Will you resend them?
219	Thanks!
219	Marie
220	Great!
220	Hopefully we will be able to sign soon.
220	Thanks!
220	Marie
221	Yes--I would like to see the signed copy before I send the Enron Corp. guaranty.
221	My office location is EB3803B.
221	thanks!
221	Marie
222	Bianca: We have a signed Master Agreement dated as of November 1, 1994 between ECT and Transammonia, Inc. acting through its division, Trammochem.
222	VX6259.1 can be confirmed under this master, therefore, you don't need anything from us.
222	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
222	Marie
223	Cindy: Has this guaranty been processed?
223	We've received the original signed master agreement from the counterparty and need to deliver the original Enron Corp. Guaranty.
223	Thanks!
223	Marie
224	Thanks!
225	Lissa: Enron Corp. does not give unlimited guaranties.
225	The amount will be determined by our Credit Department based upon the credit in your draft ISDA.
225	Marie
226	Thanks.
226	I was able to open them.
226	Marie
227	I don't have it.
228	Veronica: Will you look at the "Transfer" section on Page 11 of the Schedule and let me know if you are okay with their change?
228	Thanks!
228	Marie
229	No. Thanks for asking.
230	You can go to the IRS website at www.irs.gov and download copies of the appropriate tax forms.
231	Yes, I got the copy.
231	I will send you a copy of the guaranty when I receive it.
232	David: Your counterparty is being impossible.
232	Please see their latest message below.
232	They won't even send us their draft ISDA until we provide them with every little bit of info.
232	This is only a draft, not the final one.
232	It can and probably will be negotiated.
232	Thanks!
232	Marie
233	Here it is!
234	Kim: Attached for your further handling are a clean and blacklined draft of the revised Schedule and Paragraph 13 for the City of Glendale.
234	We will try to verify the outside counsel to use in connection with rendering the legal opinion so that we can begin that process.
234	If we have any problems, it may have to wait until Sara Shackleton returns on 9/4 since she is more familiar with who we use and what the extent of the engagement will be.
234	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
234	Marie
235	Mr. Boytinck: I am sending this e-mail to check on the status of the Master Agreement for Garden City Plaza Ltd. that was forwarded to you for execution.
235	It would be appreciated if you would let me know the status.
235	Thank you!
236	Hi, Tracy!
236	I've never received the signature pages to the Allegheny ISDA initialled by you.
236	Have you
237	Hi, Tracy!
237	I have never received the signature pages for the Allegheny ISDA.
237	Have you sent them?
237	Mare
238	Boy, I'm REALLY mad at you!
238	Just kidding!
238	I thought you were just going to initial the signature pages and then we would get Kevin to sign it here.
238	Since you're in town, I can run the originals down to you (if you'll tell me where you are) so that you can initial and then I can ask Kevin to sign.
238	Thanks!
238	Marie
239	Tomorrow is fine.
240	I'll be ready and waiting!
241	Attached is the draft Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty.
241	Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
241	Marie
242	Hi, Gordon!
242	This is a Chilean counterparty that Nidia Mendoza in Credit asked us to prepare a "sample" Deemed ISDA for.
242	This is all I know, which probably isn't much.
242	Marie
243	Please ignore my earlier e-mail forwarding the Deemed ISDA.
243	Thanks!
243	Marie
244	Is John Suttle okay with our providing this guaranty and in this amount?
244	Also, are you signing a master agreement or a short form confirmation?
244	I don't know if we can get this guaranty on such short notice, but we'll try.
244	Marie
245	I don't know what you told them, but it sure got them to respond.
246	Mr. Kohler: Just a follow-up to check on the status of the Master Agreement forwarded to you by our Calgary office for execution.
246	Thanks!
247	Here are my exceptions: Thanks!
248	Tracy: Can you prepare this guaranty for Pat Leahy?
248	The EBS entity will be Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. As you can see from the e-mails below, they need this guaranty today.
248	Thanks!
248	Marie
249	You barely escaped our wrath this time, but there's always the next!
250	We've had the lynch mob organized for some time now.
250	We're just trying to use the "kinder and gentler" approach for now.
250	But, if that doesn't work, look out!
251	Where were you yesterday?
251	You didn't stop by to initial Allegheny.
251	Are you going to initial this before you go to London?
252	We have received an executed financial Master Agreement.
252	Type of Contract: Master Agreement (Industrial) Effective Date: August 2, 2001 Enron Entity: Enron Canada Corp. Counterparty: Albchem Industries Ltd. Transactions Covered: Approved for natural gas and crude oil products.
252	Not approved for pulp and paper, weather, foreign exchange, steel, interest rate and currency or forward rate.
252	Confirming Entity: Enron Canada Corp. Governing Law: Province of Alberta
253	No, you can do power.
254	Yes
255	If you are still in Houston tomorrow and get the urge to initial the ISDA, please call Samantha Boyd at 39188 and she will be happy to either show you where they are or send them to you (wherever you may be).
255	Thanks!
255	Marie
256	Yes.
257	I thought you were going to come by and initial the master agreement.
257	I can't get it signed until you initial.
257	Will you please initial the two pages I faxed to you on 8/13 and fax back to me ASAP so that I can have the agreement signed here in Houston?
257	Thanks.
258	Hi, Robbi!
258	Hope you are enjoying your time off.
258	I know I certainly enjoyed Friday and Tuesday and hated to come back today.
258	Anne and I went to the Decorative Center yesterday, and tried to check out some samples at Beacon Hill (Robert Allen Fabrics) and they couldn't find your account.
258	Do you have an account there, or was I mistaken?
258	Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.
258	At Beacon Hill (Robert Allen): Pattern: Bearnson Color: Aged Gold Pattern: Scholtes Color: Cinnabar Pattern: McGeary Color: Citron At Brunschwig & Fils (Gaston y Daniela): Pattern No.: 82315-198 Name: Chevron Woven Texture Color: Teja Name: Chevron Woven Texture Color: Verde Agua At Schumacher & Co. (Greeff) Pattern No.: 3185017 Name: Ephemera Color: Grass Pattern No.: 3185046 Name: Ephemera Color: Bittersweet Pattern No.: 3112096 Name: Alpine Color: Pumpkin If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo.
258	They sell his fabrics there.
258	Thanks!
258	We really appreciate your help.
258	Marie
259	Mike: We are still waiting on a credit worksheet from Credit.
259	We can't proceed without a worksheet.
259	Marie
260	Sara: Attached are copies of the confirms.
260	I put a copy in each of the Citibank and Delta files.
260	I don't remember there being a project name.
260	Marie
261	I have received the executed certificates from Enron Corp. and will send to you via overnight courier.
261	I will also include the Termination of the Gua|
262	Steve: I have sent the amendment to the Agency Agreement to Gary Hickerson for signature on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc. When executed, I will fax you a copy.
262	How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?
262	Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?
262	I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.
262	Please let me know how you want to handle this.
262	In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.
262	ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between "Investments" and "Inc.".
262	Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.
262	Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
262	Marie
263	Hi, Steve: What is your exact location so that hopefully, the document will reach you and not float around Enron House?
263	Thanks!
263	Marie
264	Okay.
264	Do you want me to just walk down to your office?
265	My heart skipped a beat when I read "Today is my last day...".
265	I thought you were leaving Enron.
265	Thank goodness you are only moving to a different group.
265	Congratulations and look forward to working with you in your new job!
265	Marie
266	Veronica: There shouldn't be a legal reason why we can't do this, however, we will need copies of all the Enron Corp. guaranties (and any amendments thereto), together with details of all contracts that will be covered.
266	Also, has Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. provided any incoming guaranties and, if so, do we want to consolidate those?
266	Marie
267	That's okay.
267	I'll call you before I leave.
268	Sure, but we'll need the same info for them.
269	If you're scheduled for 9/4, you've missed it, but I guess you really mean 9/11.
269	Don't you just love a smart aleck?
270	Annabel: We have been waiting on you as per the attached e-mail from June 1, 2001.
270	Please call Sara when you have reviewed the attached e-mail once again.
270	Thanks!
270	Marie
271	Okay.
271	I thought you already had an account with them.
271	My mistake.
271	Also, do you have an account with Kravet?
271	We found a piece of their fabric that we really liked.
271	How was your vacation?
271	I'm sure you're glad to be back!
271	Marie
272	Karen: I will fax you a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement and First Amendment.
272	Marie
273	Attached are a clean and blacklined version of P.M.I.'s Amendment Agreement with our changes noted.

274	Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
274	Marie
275	OOPS!
275	Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you.
275	Marie
276	Molly: You might want to check with Robin Hill, since I don't know who is still there at EBS and who has left.
277	Sorry to hear about Dirk.
277	I will certainly let you know if I hear of anything.
277	We don't need any samples at Kravet--we have found a piece of their fabric that we are pretty sure we want to get.
277	The contractor is starting work on our house Monday, so our fun will be beginning.
277	Talk to you later.
277	Marie
278	I have provided everyone with a copy of the self study guide "From Edison to Enron - an Evolution".
279	Becky: I left early yesterday (as did everyone else) so I have no comments.
280	Mr. Cooper: Pursuant to Darren Vanek's request, I am forwarding a form of multi-product/multi-affiliate guaranty.
280	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.
281	Hi, Max!
281	Francisco Pinto-Leite asked me to forward this draft to you to review the additional credit terms.
281	Please review the definition of "Independent Amount" on page 2 of Annex A and the definitions of "Base Volume" and "Incremental Volume" on pages 6 and 7 of Annex A and let us know if this is what you want, or please revise as you would like.
281	Thanks!
281	Marie
282	FYI
283	Exception: 9/5 - Vacation thanks!
284	Cindy: Attached for your further handling are an Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of the The City of Glendale, together with related secretary's certificates.
284	Please let me know when the documents have been signed and I'll arrange for pickup.
284	Thanks!
284	Marie
285	I would like the Roasted Chicken Cobb Salad, with no eggs, if possible, and vinaigrette dressing.
285	Oh, and extra sugar cookies, please!
285	Thanks!
285	Marie
286	This is pretty eerie!
287	Thanks for sending this.
287	I just spoke with Randy Miller and told him that we probably wouldn't get it to him today, but we would certainly send it over on Monday morning.
287	Samantha is working on it.
288	Thanks!
288	I'll use this one and delete the disclaimer.
289	Mark: Attached for your further handling is the draft Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services, L.P. and Dynegy Europe.
289	Please do not hesitate to contact either Robbi Rossi (x57268) or Tracy Cooper (x59534) with any questions or comments.
290	I have received Credit's comments and will try to turn around comments soon.
290	Marie
291	Tanya and Paul: Linda Anderson in Financial Settlements faxed me a copy of a Certificate of Amalgamation evidencing the merger of Norske Skog Canada Limited and Pacifica Papers Inc. with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.
291	You both worked on these files--Tanya, Pacifica Papers and Paul, Norske Skog.
291	Are you all okay with this merger from the credit side?
291	Thanks!
291	Marie
292	Which Hess entity?
293	Never mind!
293	Frank Sayre is looking at it.
294	Bianca: Samantha Boyd is working on this deal, so you may want to check with her.
294	Marie
295	Paul: Let me know if you need anything else.
295	Marie
296	Hi, Tanya!
296	Here is CSFB's draft Schedule and Paragraph 13 for Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe).
296	We will do a comparison when we get a worksheet.
296	Thanks!
296	Marie
297	What is your location and I'll have a "sample" sent to you.
297	Marie
298	Hi, Georgi!
298	In light of the NYMEX being closed last week, the 5 paralegals are involved in a project right now that is taking up our extra time, so we don't know when we would be able to get to this project.
298	Perhaps someone in your group could come to our area and copy these files.
298	Just let us know who and when they will be coming and we will help them locate the documents.
298	Thanks!
298	Marie
299	You can fax the guaranty to me (646-3490).
299	Marie
300	Veronica: FYI.
300	Let me know what you want to do.
300	Marie
301	Sounds good to me!
302	Mark: Attached is my work report.
302	Marie
303	Eric and Russell: I spoke with Roeline Hudson at Torch just a few minutes ago.
303	She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.
303	She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.
303	The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.
303	Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.
303	We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.
303	Please let me know if you have any questions.
303	Marie
304	I had a sneaking suspicion that it just might be you!
304	Will you send me your fax number?
304	Thanks!
305	I am preparing the information on the Company Account Application and have a question regarding the address section.
305	I have completed the section regarding ECT Investment's "principal executive office" (Houston address) and would like to know how this differs, or if it differs, from the address of "registered office".
305	Would you explain the difference, if any?
305	Thank you.
306	Veronica: Can you provide me with a list of documents in place with Oneok (other than the ISDA) and the ENA entity and products covered under each agreement.
306	I'm not familiar with the documentation that ENA Upstream, EES and EGLI would have in place with Oneok.
306	Thanks!
306	Marie
307	See below
308	Whew!!!!
308	I had a hard time following such "proper" English!
309	Robbi: If you haven't found anyone else to go, I would like to go.
309	Just let me know.
309	Thanks!
309	Marie
310	(713) 896-1673.
310	It doesn't matter to me if we eat before or go for coffee after.
310	The only places I know to eat near the Wortham are at Bayou Place.
310	I know there's Hard Rock Cafe, a barbecue place and I don't know what else is there.
310	Let me know what you want to do.
310	If we don't eat before, I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre.
311	It would definitely be out of your way.
311	I don't mind driving downtown, so why don't we just meet at the Wortham at about 7?.
311	We have been parking in one of the outside lots off Smith right across from the side of the Wortham (the Bank One Lot) since the flood closed down so many of the underground garages.
312	Me too!
313	Ms. Navarro: Thank you for sending your comments to the guaranty.
313	Please note our comments below.
314	Carol: I apologize for not getting back to you on Friday, but it was pretty hectic here.
314	There are no special provisions for a German counterparty other than the tax reps.
314	We do have a treaty with Germany.
314	Let me know if you need anything else.
314	Marie
315	Mr. Daborn: Would you please send me your delivery address so that I can send you the documentation requested in connection with the opening of ECT Investments' account with CSFB Europe?
315	Thank you!
316	Gordon: Attached is the revised Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty, changing the EBITDA/Interest Expense ratio.
316	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
316	Marie
317	Gordon: Have you received a W8BEN tax form and/or a legal opinion from Nemak?
317	They are supposed to deliver these to us in connection with the signed ISDA Master Agreement, but I haven't seen them and before I contact them, I thought I'd check just to make sure you didn't receive them.
317	Thanks!
317	Marie
318	Thanks, Gordon.
318	I'll send them a letter asking for these items.
318	Thanks!
318	Marie
319	Celeste: You can use this ISDA to confirm your weather deal.
319	Marie
320	We have credit sign off on all masters, amendments, assignments and terminations--any document where credit is involved.
320	We don't have them initial the day to day confirms, but if there is a confirm with a lot of credit terms which may have been negotiated, then we'll have them initial those.
320	Marie
321	Looks like we may have an agreed to guaranty from Pemex.
322	Hi, Diane!
322	Can you have someone in your group provide me with copies of the following confirms: If you will call when the copies are ready, I'll send one of our clerks down to pick them up.
322	Thanks!
322	Marie
323	Veronica: Here's the Coastal States Trading, Inc.'s ISDA.
323	Marie
324	Carol: Attached are the ENA/Enron Corp. certificates.
324	I was just going to work off these forms when (or if) EBS ever executed an ISDA.
325	Do we know a counterparty name or do I have to look at all our files?
326	I can't help this time.
326	The only Enron Corp. guaranty we have was issued in connection with financial transactions only.
326	Sorry.
327	Kim: Attached are the forms I mentioned.
327	Let me know if they have any questions.
327	Marie
328	Here is the tax i.d.
328	number for ENA Upstream Company LLC: 76-0318139.
328	Let me know if you need anything else.
328	Marie
329	Attached is Annex B to be attached to the confirms for Deal Nos. Y49003.1 and Y49036.1.
329	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
329	Marie
330	I believe all deals going forward.
330	Am I right, Max?
331	Martha: Thanks for getting the changes to the form of guaranty approved.
331	Will you please have the guaranty dated effective as of January 1, 2001?
331	Also, who will be the party signing the guaranty, and when can we expect to receive the signed guaranty?
331	In addition, when the guaranty has been signed on your part, will you please fax a copy to me at (713) 646-3490?
331	Again, thank you for your assistance on this.
331	Marie
332	FYI
333	Hi, Veronica!
333	I'm trying to clean some files off my desk and one of them is Bayer.
333	Are you still going to revise the credit?
333	Thanks!
333	Marie
334	We have received an executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of September 21, 2001 by and between Virginia Power Energy Marketing, Inc. and Enron North America Corp. This first amendment increases the collateral thresholds for both Party A and Party B. Copies will be distributed.
335	No exceptions.
335	Thanks
336	I think I received this e-mail in error.
336	I am in the Legal-financial trading group.
336	Marie
337	Diane: We just sent drafts to Torch as they needed to send them to UOM, Dynegy and Sempra for review.
337	When we get them signed, I'll distribute copies.
337	Marie
338	Mark: I would like to schedule this Friday, 10/5 as a vacation day.
338	Please let me know if this presents a problem.
338	Thanks!
338	Marie
339	Hi, Georgi: We have an entry in our database that states that Energy West Incorporated did not change its name to Mercator Energy Incorporated.
339	There are two companies with the same name and this one is not the one that changed its name.
339	Our Energy West Incorporated is a Montana corporation.
339	The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation.
339	Let me know if this is confusing.
339	Marie
340	Hi, Diane: In your spare time (HA! HA!) will you check and let me know the earliest outstanding trade dates for the following counterparties: Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd. They are ready to sign the ISDAs.
340	Thanks!
340	Marie
341	Hi, Todd: Believe it or not, I am working on our comments to the ISDA and hope to have them to you this week.
341	If I see we won't get them to you this week, I'll let you know.
341	Thanks!
341	Marie
342	Hi, Brian: The ISDA is being faxed to you now.
342	Marie
343	Cindy: Attached are forms of Enron Corp. guaranties and related certificates to be issued in connection with ISDA Master Agreements between ENA and Catequil Partners, L.P. and ENA and Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd. Please let me know when the attached documents are ready and I'll arrange for pick up.
343	Thanks!
343	Marie
344	Correct.
344	I just left you a voice mail re the termination.
345	Do you want me to take a first stab at these two agreements?
346	Attached is a copy of the transmittal letter forwarding the draft ISDA Master Agreement to Southern States.
346	Marie
347	Rotation, please.
348	Mr. Guinn: Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching for your review a proposed Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement amending the existing amendment to change the Part 4 section references.
348	Please advise if the attached document is acceptable, and I will have two copies signed and forward to you for execution by Bank of America.
348	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
349	Diane, Tanya and Jay: We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).
349	We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.
349	Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?
349	We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).
349	Thanks!
349	Marie
350	Hi, Russell: Attached for review is the draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the Torch deals.
350	Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
350	Thanks!
350	Marie
351	Do you want to send it to Roeline or do you want me to?
352	Thanks, Diane!
353	Okay with me!
354	Hi, Roeline!
354	Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the assignments and terminations.
354	Please let me know if you have any comments.
354	Our Confirmation Desk is in the process of revising the termination of ENA Deal No. NL0619.1 to delete the fee reference, and I will forward it to you when ready.
354	Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.
354	Thanks!
354	Marie
355	FYI
356	Linda: Will you follow-up with Tanya in Credit as to exactly what type of documents you need copies of, or arrange for someone to go and look through her files?
356	Tanya's phone # is 33263.
356	Thanks!
356	Marie
357	She was going to revise the termination and bring it to me, but I haven't gotten it yet.
357	Marie
358	FYI
359	Tom: You can only see the master agreement database.
359	The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.
359	The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.
359	It should be in the brokerage agreement database.
359	We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.
359	Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke, Marie
360	You should have received a fax from me by now.
360	Have you not received it?
361	Yes.
362	Hi, Roeline!
362	I'm sending the original revised Termination Agreement over to you this afternoon.
362	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
362	Marie
363	Yea, and it needs to stop right now!
364	Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.
364	We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.
364	Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?
364	(Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.) Thanks!
364	Marie
365	Hi, Roeline: We would prefer to sign the fee letter at the same time we sign the assignments.
365	Yes, we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original.
365	Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow, as I will be out of the office Friday.
365	Marie
366	Barbara and Anne: Below is an e-mail I sent to schedule a meeting with the confirm desks to discuss the materials we will need in order to start the review of the confirm templates.
366	Do you want to attend?
366	If so, I will notify you once I hear from everyone else as to their availability so that we can schedule a meeting that we all can attend.
366	Thanks!
366	Marie
367	Okay.
367	Why don't you let me know on Monday your availability for next week.
367	Thanks!
367	Marie
368	Hi, Dianne: Thanks for responding so quickly.
368	It seems that we will be scheduling the meeting for next week.
368	Are you available then?
368	Marie
369	This is an easy one.
369	1400 Smith, EB3803B.
369	Thanks!
369	Marie
370	Diane: I hate to bother you since you're busy, but will you sign one more original of each of the two Torch termination agreements for me?
370	Torch wants a copy with original signatures for their file, so in order for us to have an original with their signature, we need to have two originals signed.
370	When they're ready, if you'll call me, I'll send a clerk down to get them.
370	Thanks!
370	Marie
371	What about next week?
371	Diane asked if we could schedule for next week as she is swamped and short-handed this week.
371	Marie
372	You're the best!
372	Thanks!
373	FYI.
373	We received this worksheet from Aparna for a trade with Interstate Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries?
374	Do you have a fax/phone number for Eric Twombly?
374	Thanks!
374	Marie
375	Mr. Smith: Pursuant to Wendi LeBrocq's request, I am attaching a draft Confidentiality Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Sunlaw Energy Corporation.
375	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
375	If the attached is acceptable, we will prepare two original copies, signed by Enron North America Corp. and forward to you for execution.
375	Thank you for your assistance.
376	Sara: I do not see a copy of an opinion in the file nor have we received one since I sent the execution copies of the ISDA to Steve Lins.
376	Marie
377	Yes.
377	I do have a meeting at 10 this morning, but should be out around 11.
377	Just let me know.
378	I did the comparison and gave it to Mary to review.
378	Credit is deciding what to do in light of the problems with the airlines.
379	Matt: Attached for your further handling is the form of guaranty to be issued by Commercial Metals Co. in favor of ENA, guaranteeing obligations of SMI.
379	Please note that Commercial Metals needs to complete SMI's correct legal name.
379	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
379	Marie
380	This has sound to it.
381	We would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, October 10 from 2:00 to 3:00 in EB38C2 to discuss the materials Legal will need in connection with its review and approval of all confirmation templates currently being used.
381	Please let me know if you will be able to attend.
381	Thanks!
381	Marie Dianne S. We will conference you in.
382	We have a scheduling conflict with our conference rooms.
382	Is everyone available from 9:00-10:00 Wednesday, October 10?
382	Same conference room.
382	Sorry!
382	Marie
383	So what was her beef if the copies were for our people?
384	Oh, please!
384	The exhibits should have been organized and conformed prior to execution.
385	Hi, Derek!
385	Any word on where we stand on this master agreement?
385	Hope all is well.
385	Marie
386	Another follow-up message re status of execution of master agreement.
386	Please advise.
386	Thanks!
387	Hi, Tracy!
387	Where do we stand on Allegheny?
387	We really would like to finalize this master ASAP.
387	Thanks!
387	Marie
388	Donna: I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.
388	Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?
388	Marie
389	We don't have to wait until the board meeting.
389	We do a unanimous written consent and circulate among the directors for signature.
390	I never received a response to my 9/17 e-mail to you re this amalgamation.
390	Are there any credit issues with respect to this amalgamation?
390	Thanks!
390	Marie
391	The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow from 9-10 in EB38C2.
392	Ms. Lemont: It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc. signed in April, 2001.
392	Please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
392	Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.
392	Will Bear Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the corporate documentation?
393	We have been advised by Mary Kay Lemont that Bear Stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place.
393	ECT Europe Finance, Inc. does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature.
393	Will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on Enron Credit's behalf?
393	If so, will you provide me with a current list?
393	Additionally, is this the only position that will be in this account?
393	Thanks!
393	Marie
394	Arthur has surfaced!
394	But why he's plodding through it is beyond me.
394	He said he was ready to sign so that's why we sent execution copies.
394	Obviously he hadn't even reviewed the draft.
394	Go figure!
394	Marie
395	Sooner than January?
395	I'll let you know if I hear of anything.
395	I'm sure Mark H. is planning on you just integrating into ENA's legal group.
396	Susan: Jorge Garcia on the interest rate and currency desk forwarded this e-mail to me requesting certain RMT masters.
396	Thanks!
396	Marie
397	Susan: I think this is yours.
397	Thanks!
398	Mr. Guinn: I have the Second Amendment signed by Enron North America and evidently deleted your e-mail regarding who I should send copies to for execution?
398	Will you please provide me once again with this information?
398	Thanks!
399	Jeff: I have the documents ready to be signed in connection with opening the referenced account.
399	Can you assist me in getting them signed?
399	The officers who can sign are: Any one of: Mark Frevert Ben Glisan John Sherriff together with any one of: Rick Buy Rick Carson Since we don't know the ins and outs as to why we are opening this account for this entity, Sara suggested that you or someone in your shop contact one of the officers from each group to explain the account and ask them to sign the documents.
399	Once you have determined who will sign, let me know and I'll take care of routing them for signature and getting them to Bear Stearns.
399	Thanks for your help!
399	Marie
400	Mary Kay: I am routing the documents for signature now.
400	Will fax them to you when siMarie
401	Gordon: Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced transaction, together with a fax cover page.
401	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
401	Marie
402	Mary Kay: I am faxing to you this morning those documents that we have signed so far.
402	Will you send me your physical delivery address so that I can send the originals to you?
402	Thanks!
402	Marie
403	Exceptions: Vacation Day - 10/5.
403	Thanks!
404	Yes.
404	They are sending their originals to us so that we can put them all together and distribute.
405	Tanya: Will you provide me with a definition of "Capital Reserves" which you used in the CSFB (Europe) worksheet?
405	Thanks!
405	Marie
406	Rebecca: Attached is the Annex B for Deal No. YA2985.1.
406	Please attach Annex A, Annex B and the Canadian Annex, since this is a cross border transaction.
406	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
406	Marie
407	I had no interaction with her, so can't comment.
408	YUK!
409	Cindy: Attached is a form of Enron Corp. guaranty that we are required to deliver in connection with a confirmation.
409	Please process this guaranty by the end of day tomorrow, as I must overnight it to the counterparty.
409	Let me know if you have any questions.
409	Thanks!
409	Marie
410	Cindy: Mary Perkins executed an amendment to the Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of Bear Stearns, et al on May 15, 2001.
410	The original guaranty guaranteed obligations of Enron Credit Inc. under a brokerage arrangement.
410	Bear Stearns has requested a certificate of incumbency with Mary's specimen signature.
410	I have prepared and am attaching such certificate.
410	If acceptable, please have Mary sign and Kate (or another asst. secretary) certify.
410	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
410	Thanks!
410	Marie
411	Laurel and Jorge: Attached is the form of confirmation for Credit Suisse First Boston London Branch.
411	ENA is the confirming party and calculation agent.
411	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
411	Marie
412	I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.
412	The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.
412	Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).
412	Marie
413	I am having it looked at and will
414	I am having it looked at and will send it down this afternoon.
415	Gordon: Here is the revised Deemed ISDA.
415	Let me know if you need anything else.
415	Marie
416	Hi, Robbi!
416	How are things going?
416	Any more news?
416	We have finally decided on our fabric and the amount of yardage.
416	What's the next step?
416	Thanks!
416	Marie
417	Hi, Roeline!
417	Just checking on the status of the original assignments I forwarded to you for execution.
417	Have you received them back from UOM, Dynegy and Sempra?
417	If so, will you send me an original of each for my files?
417	Hope all is going well and that you have a great weekend.
417	Marie
418	Hi, Sheila!
418	Can you verify for us the account numbers at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that we need to assign back into?
418	Thanks!
418	Marie
419	We have received the following executed assignments: 1.
419	Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of September 28, 2001 among Johns Manville Corporation and Johns Manville International, Inc. and ENA, whereby Johns Manville Corporation assigned Deal No. VH0047.1 to Johns Manville International, Inc. 2.

420	I'll have to have my accountant (Anne) write a check or whatever method is needed.
420	Again, thanks so much for your help.
420	We really appreciate it!
420	Marie
421	Oops, forgot about lunch.
421	I'm available Monday or Tuesday.
421	Just let me know if either works for you.
421	Marie
422	Ed: Attached are AES's comments to our draft ISDA.
422	Please respond to those which are credit related.
422	Thanks!
422	Marie
423	No, you can send them all together.
423	I was just trying to clean some stacks of paper off my desk and realized that I hadn't received the originals.
423	Thanks for your further assistance on this.
423	Marie
424	Richard: Credit is not throwing you off.
424	They did send a revised worksheet.
424	I turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.
424	I am working on finalizing our comments to send back to AA today.
424	Marie
425	Todd: At last, I am attaching our response to your comments of 7/19/01, together with a clean and blacklined draft of the ISDA Master Agreement for Georgia Power Company.
425	Please note that these same comments will apply for Savannah Electric and Mississippi Power with the exceptions set forth in our response.
425	Please let us know if you have any questions or additional comments.
425	We look forward to hearing your comments.
425	Marie
426	Richard: As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.
426	Credit is not throwing you off.
426	They did send a revised worksheet.
426	I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.
426	I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.
426	Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?
426	Thanks!
426	Marie
427	Richard: Thanks for the info.
427	I'll send it overnight to her and will copy you on my correspondence (with a copy of our comments).
427	Marie
428	The one from Tana is a picture, but if you scroll down further, I think it is the Bin Laden song, so there is sound with that one.
428	I also sent it home in case you can't open it or want to listen at home.
429	The first one is a picture, but if you scroll down it should be the Bin Laden song, so there's sound.
430	I don't know.
430	Which entity did the weather trade?
431	Sounds great!
431	Sorry we won't be able to help move, unpack, babysit (or should I say "queensit") but unfortunately we'll be celebrating Anne's birthday (no, not her 34th!) the same day!
431	Hopefully we'll make it up your way next year to visit and most importantly, meet "The Queen".
431	Love, Marie
432	Here is the executed masters list.
432	We will try to get you guys on the distribution list, but if we can't we'll just forward the e-mail to you.
432	Is there anyone else in your group we should add to the list?
432	Marie
433	That's fine.
433	They probably want the original.
433	Marie
434	I don't know who Debbie Nicholls is either.
435	I did and she did.
436	Hi, Roeline!
436	Eric faxed me a copy of the assignment and new confirmation signed by Sempra but I have not seen the originals.
436	Marie
437	We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the merger of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited, with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.
437	I have received verification from Credit that they are okay with this amalgamation.
437	I will forward a copy of the documentation to Global Counterparty.
437	Marie
438	Cheryl: We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the amalgamation of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.
438	Credit is aware of this and has no problems.
438	I will forward copies of the documentation to you.
438	Let me know if you have any questions.
438	Marie
439	I wish I could, but I have a paralegal lunch today.
440	Cindy: Attached are a form of Enron Corp. guaranty and certificate of incumbency to be executed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement with Pursue Energy Corporation.
440	Please call me when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pickup.
440	Thanks!
440	Marie
441	This is cute.
442	Yes, please.
442	Also, please add taxes.
442	We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.
442	Do you want us to pay in advance?
442	That won't be a problem either.
442	Thanks!
442	Marie
443	Well, I guess that's why they get to have such nice, pretty stores.
443	What's Eric doing up here meeting with the attorneys?
443	Also, Jane said that Mary Nell and Peter were given packages?
443	Is this true?
444	Do we have a conflict?
444	The CA will be to obtain financials.
444	Thanks!
444	Marie
445	Glad you enjoyed them!
446	I bet Mary Nell was made that they wouldn't let her come back to Houston.
446	I haven't heard anything.
446	I know that several of our lawyers and Carol have been meeting to finalize a Master Netting agreement.
446	There are some issues with the master netting agreement and some of the big financing transactions.
446	Maybe that's what they are working on.
446	If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
447	That makes sense since we have that SEC inquiry going on.
448	My sentiments exactly!
449	Did I send this to you already?
450	Gordon: Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced deal, together with a fax cover sheet.
450	Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
450	Marie
451	Oh, my gosh!
451	Thanks.
451	I'll resend it.
452	Charlie: Attached for your further handling are drafts of the First Amendment to Master Agreement, together with a First Amendment to Guaranty in connection with the ENA/3TEC master agreement.
452	Please note that in addition to amending certain credit provisions, we are also amending the current setoff provision and also adding a provision regarding "severability".
452	If the attached drafts are acceptable, please let me know and I'll process for execution.
452	Marie
453	Please be advised that Sara has approved and Bill Bradford as signed, on behalf of ENA, the following documentation: 1.
453	Fourth Amendment to Master Energy Price Swap Agreement between ENA and Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.; 2.
453	Amendment Agreement between ENA and The Chase Manhattan Bank; and 3.
453	Derivatives Novation Letter among Deutsche Bank AG, Bankers Trust Company and ENA.
453	Originals of the above documents have been forwarded to the respective counterparties for execution.
454	Tom: We have our own form of corporate resolutions.
454	It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.
454	I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.
454	Marie
455	Hi, Matt!
455	How's the new job going?
455	Things are so crazy here, it's unbelievable!
455	My e-mail where you forwarded the proposed resolutions to me was automatically deleted.
455	Can you send it to me again, or tell me where I can find the documents?
455	Thanks!
455	Marie
456	Mary: Pursuant to Sara's request, I am attaching a list of the brokerage agreements and other documentation we either currently have in place or are negotiating with Goldman, Sachs et al.
456	Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
456	Marie
457	Mary Cook has requested that you attend a meeting tomorrow morning (Tuesday, October 30) from 10:00 to 11:00 in EB38C2 to discuss master netting agreements.
457	The directive Mary has presently been given is that we will be preparing various master netting agreements and she would like to solicit as much additional help as she can.
457	If the directive changes before the meeting tomorrow, we will advise everyone.
457	Please review the below attachments prior to the meeting if your schedule allows.
457	Thanks!
457	Marie
458	Here are the guidelines for an ECP.
458	Hope this helps.
458	If not, let me know.
458	Is there supposed to be bad news coming?
459	Cindy: This is the guaranty I spoke with Clement about.
459	It MUST be signed either this afternoon or first thing tomorrow morning.
459	It is our standard guaranty except that it is multiparty/multiproduct.
459	Please call me when it's ready and I'll send someone to pick it up.
459	Thanks!
459	Marie
460	Mr. Dixon: Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
460	Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.
460	Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
461	Just a reminder not to use the form Master Netting Agreement that was attached to the e-mail notification sent yesterday.
461	You will be receiving a new form later today.
461	Thanks!

619	Which of the documents do you specifically need--all or just the ISDAs, swap confirmations and guarantees.

619	Thanks!
619	Marie
620	Hi, Greg!
620	Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.

620	Is this Yosemite II?
620	If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc. Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?

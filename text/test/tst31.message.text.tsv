14	How are you today?
14	The ball game last night was a disaster!
14	We give the "Bad News Bears" a bad name.
14	Example: Runners on 1st and 2nd.
14	I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.
14	He replies touch third base.
14	So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.
14	I give up!
14	We lost 20 to 3 On a worse note.
14	Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
14	I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.
14	She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.
14	He has done nothing but foster this attitude.
14	Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.
14	I will let you know what comes of things.
14	Why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil.
14	I hate all of this shit!

15	If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?
15	I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING) Your laughing , right!
15	Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.
15	I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.
15	Im looking forward to Friday night!
15	Don't forget your number for roulette.

35	I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.
35	1) It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.
35	Under the current limits the Central desk can have a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger.
35	2) When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.
35	VAR LIMITS DESK P/L EAST $10 MILLION ($66.1) MILLION CENTRAL $12 MILLION ($13.9) MILLION 3) It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I. There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.
35	In fact in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit.
35	I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR limit.
35	The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.
35	(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000. If the situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.) This method I believe makes for an even playing field.
35	Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.
35	Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.
35	Thanks, Jim

42	As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.
42	Economics are favorable to keep injecting.
42	I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.
42	At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.
42	Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?
42	Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.
42	Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?
42	I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!
42	Please let me know your thoughts.
43	This assumes 65 bcf or approximately 67 tbtu of pad gas.
43	According to this mornings Operations Reprt there is 88.3 bcf in the cavern.
43	This includes Third Party Storage volumes of approximately 3.4 tbtu.
43	Let me know if this is not what you werer asking.

46	As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.
46	As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.
46	Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.
47	Ted: Please respond to Brian's question on when the Ad Val Tax is paid.

73	Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information: 1) What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?
73	how does the load profile look now and how is the load profile expected to change in the future?
73	2) If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
73	Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.
74	Sell 250 November NYMEX Contracts @ $2.61 Buy 250 November NYMEX Contracts @ $ 2.43
75	For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit that I work for Enron!
75	I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management and agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Management can not be trusted.
75	Ethics and Morals are either something everyone else needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior Management started believing the end justifies the means.
75	The communication the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such as Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda intended to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these values so that no one would really notice that their actions represented something just the opposite.
75	I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human nature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you have said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in the future.
75	Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with the statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue" implies to me that this individual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certainly should not be speaking to the public.
75	If you are going to play the game of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to present a plausible story.
75	To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the definition of the word "HEDGE".
75	A hedge by definition implies that the upside and downside exposure has been limited.
75	It frightens me that we are out asking customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure Enron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?
75	I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow in the investment vehicle that generated this write down.
75	I must be confused in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the Natural Gas Business.
75	This must be an example of as my father used to say " do as I say not as I do"?
75	I guess we need to have audits performed of Senior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as their word?
75	The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these transactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opinion is "CRIMINAL".
75	It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perpetrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.
75	These individuals have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and need to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.
75	They are set for life, having all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders have lost their life savings.
75	You have completely failed at the job you were hired to perform.
75	If this type of activity would have occurred farther down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involved and to institute criminal charges.
75	I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.
75	I do not think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we trust what is said anyway.
75	Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a thorough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job performance to date.
76	Laura, Please let them know that I do not plan on attending.
76	Thanks
77	I really wish you would not feel that way or make an apology.
77	I do not consider what you expressed Friday night was anything other than honesty and true emotion and I would like to feel comfortable expressing those same feelings to you!
77	I trust you and respect your opinion to great extent because of the above.
77	If I can help its yours!
77	Smile and take a deep breath!
77	I believe their is a reason for everything!
77	Let me know if their is anything you want me to express at the "All Employee Mtg" Swig
78	Sorry about not returning your call this morning!
78	I was trying to finish my questions for the All Employee meeting!
78	Like it made any difference!
78	They would not address any of my questions.
78	What made it worst is I can not believe how STUPID the general Enron employee population is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
78	In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind!
78	I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!!
78	I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone!
78	Except you of course!
78	lets talk tonight.
78	Jarrod has a 6:00 pm ball game, but I do not think we are going!
78	Thanks, for calling!
78	Swig
79	Thanks, Boy I'm disappointed in the questions asked by other employee's!
79	Maybe the Employees deserve what they get?
79	Sounds like Parris was quick but fun.
79	Glad it was you and not me on the plane for 17 hours.
79	Be good and stay safe Swig
80	I slept good also!
80	Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74 I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far!
80	I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
80	I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there!
80	Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter!
80	They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance!
80	It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it!
80	If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?
80	Sorry, to be complaining!
80	Talk to you later!
80	Swig
81	Thought you might enjoy this?

83	How are you today?
83	Things are OK down here!
83	Nothing really new since last night!
83	NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
83	That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
83	Its the little things that count, right!
83	They continue to hate ENE!
83	It really makes me wonder?
83	Be Safe!
83	Swig
84	Thanks!

90	It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
90	Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!
90	Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
90	It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
90	They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
90	I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.
90	Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
90	Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
90	The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.
90	Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!
90	Swig
91	I think he will be talking with you!
92	I think the industry needs to look at Enron credit rating like a male looks at a women's Bra size.
92	A triple B is actually better than a triple A What do you think?
93	Hi There!
93	I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
93	I went to New Orleans last weekend.
93	It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
93	I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
93	It was a nice feeling!
93	Are we still on for Wednesday night?
93	It still works for me!
93	I hope all is well!

94	DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties -- WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
94	Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31, 2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.
94	In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO.
94	At that time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.
94	In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the filing.
94	Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.
94	The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within the 60 days.
94	Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company.

95	Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.
95	What do you think????????????????????????
95	Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance?
95	I'm sorry!
95	I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!
95	The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
95	I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest"
96	Sorry, I missed your call.
96	I was to busy being sarcastic about ENE!
96	How about 6:00 PM.
96	I can go for a run beforehand.
96	I picked the time so you have to pick the place.

99	Chris: Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread.
99	The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.
99	As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.
99	We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.
99	Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.
99	Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.
99	We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!
99	I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model.
100	Greg: A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.
100	Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1) Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
100	2) If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
100	3) What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?
100	Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!
100	Thanks, Jim
101	If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).
101	Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content?
102	FOR YOUR INFORMATION
103	Greg: Thanks for the quick and candid response.
103	I appreciate it!
103	Jim
104	I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.
104	I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!
104	Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.
104	Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.
104	Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.
104	Ha, Ha
105	Thought you might enjoy!
106	John: Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.
106	As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.
106	After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.
106	Any method other than the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.
106	Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.
106	Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.
106	The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.
106	I appreciate your reading my input!
107	I did receive!

111	Hi Tammy!
111	Thanks for asking about me!
111	I'm doing fine.
111	I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess.
111	It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly.
111	I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?
111	How about you and Mike?
111	I hope all is well!
111	If there is anything I can do please let me know?
111	Jim
112	Jeff: Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.
112	It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.
112	Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?
112	Do I need special approval?
112	Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.
112	If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.
112	I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.
112	Thanks, Jim

113	I think it is around $35,000.
113	I believe Pat should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001) I hope this is what you were looking for?

114	Jeff: I finally received the replacement pages for the Centana Stg Contract.

114	Thanks, Jim Schwieger

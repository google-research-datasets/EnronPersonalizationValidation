1	Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe (www.bishopslodge.com).
1	Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.
1	The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the activities going on in Santa Fe.
1	I think you are going to be too late for their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other fun things going on.
1	The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking pool, horseback riding and shooting.
1	Take a look.
2	That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.
2	I have attached the proposed form of confirmation.
2	I have combined in it the usual tax language we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company (Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through non-U.S. branches (England).
2	Please let me know if the tax language meets with your approval.
3	Rod, Nella sent me a Compliance Certificate and financial statements for the referenced counterparty.
3	I am forwarding them down to you.
4	I sent the UBS Letter to the confirm desk like a week ago, I forget who to, maybe Bernice, since I kinda consider it an audit letter.
4	My note said the confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to confirm trade information.
4	The Teeside Confirm, I spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it...I'll call them again.
5	Have you had a chance to look at that confirm language yet.
5	The trade was done a few days ago, and the clock is ticking on how long we can get a confirm out before we get in trouble.
6	What's the scoop, can't come up with ten Top 10's?!!
6	I never thought I'd see the day...
7	Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.
7	We had a nice lunch at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my house for a chat.
7	Linda had pictures of Jenny.
7	She is a beautiful 14 year old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.
7	She was voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.
7	Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.
7	But she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life.
7	I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal Conference.
7	We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night and we're all a bit excited about that.
7	Then Thursday night is our big night out at a blues club.
7	This email was a good idea.
7	Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting with her more than every two years!
7	I'll be in touch when I get back.
7	All my love,
8	Per my voicemail, the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax lawyers, I'll be in touch once we resolve the tax language.
9	I'll be leaving for New Orleans in about 30 minutes for our legal conference.
9	It was fun visiting with you too.
9	I miss you terribly.
10	Jeff Hodge is your man!
11	see lotus notes problems
12	We had a new paralegal start in our group Monday.
12	Her name is Susan Bailey.
12	Can you get her access to our Master Swap Agreement Database.
12	Thanks.
13	We have finally received comments on the ISDA from the referenced counterparty.
13	I have sent copies to each of you.
13	There were substantial comments to the guaranty so I have sent a copy of the guaranty along with the comments to Clem.
13	Clem, congrats on that trophy!
14	Please keep me on the distribution for all credit worksheets.
14	Thanks.
15	I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement on the gas side to see what you've done before.
15	Debbie Brackett says she knows what agreement you're talking about.
15	I'll keep you posted.
16	Just to keep you in the loop on things.
16	Lee sent me the following email and I'm following up trying to figure this out.
16	I spoke to Debbie Brackett in our Credit Dept. when I got back from London and she seemed to be aware of the contract Lee has been talking about.
16	I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement from Debbie so I can figure this out.
16	I'll keep you posted.
16	How are things going there?
16	Same old grind?!
17	In don't know anything about this, do you?
18	As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap agreements.
18	I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept. copies of the current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him revisions to the forms.
18	I'll keep you posted when the changes occur.
19	Mark Taylor is going the be the host of the next ECT Legal Conference to be held in the Woodlands in October and he asked me to contact you to see if you know yet which of the Brits are going to be attending because we need to start making reservations.
19	If you get a minute and can drop me a line I'd appreciate it.
19	Thanks!
20	Thanks!
21	Per our conversation, attached is your bid form.
22	I sent Scott Sefton and email and he responded that at this time he doesn't know the exact Brits that will be coming for the conference, he expects 6-8.
22	I think we should order 8 mens shirts in large.
22	So I don't think you need to email him or Michael Brown.
22	Thanks for your help!
23	You are right.
23	They need to get the date on their calendars, and pass it on to anyone they might think is coming.
24	Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill today about 3:30 pm our time.
24	I have the originals and asked her to tell me what address she wants me to send the originals to.
24	I didn't date the front page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.
24	I'm working on getting the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same package, maybe tomorrow.
24	I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do.
25	Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.
25	My goal is to get everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve before I have to file by June 11th.
25	When the financials are ready I need to get them certified by the highest accounting officer.
25	Last year that was Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting.
25	Will he be signing again?
26	One personal day this monday.
27	Brent, I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement database and using it for your contract applications.
27	It is my hope to use it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.
27	All you would need to do is change the contract drop downs.
27	Contact Mike Neves, who is working on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to developing a similar system for you.
28	I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp.
28	"signing" the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.
28	Actually what Utilicorp.
28	did in this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 of the agreement).
28	They signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations.
28	If we can get them to agree to the same language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better than getting a guaranty.
28	Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.
28	All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.
28	Let me know if I can be of further service...
29	Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the counterparty.
29	Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of incorporation of the counterparty.
29	I will not assign the review of Italian law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.
29	If you feel we need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start looking at it.
30	Scott, one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of his friends and asked if we could take a look at it.
30	I gave it to Mark Taylor and since the fellow lives in England he thought it would be better sent to you.
31	That may not be so easy an answer.
31	I think we would have to talk to Utilicorp.'s lawyers.
31	I wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.
31	Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.
31	If you need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and we'll give them a call.
32	Thanks for taking a look!
33	That's ok.
33	Our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade.
34	Just an FYI About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the referenced counterparty.
34	She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.
34	I got a call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.
34	I called John and gave him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals before trading, etc. I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get the trade, we're not surprised.
35	I don't have anything specific to weather, I have material from recent general seminars I've worked on for Mark T. and Mark H. if you need it.
35	I do have general articles on weather...
35	I'm glad to see they have the "A Team" as a speaker.
35	You're marvelous!
36	Brent, I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke Energy International.
36	All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can use it on the Argentina deal.
36	Credit doesn't appear to know anything about the deal.
36	I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.
36	It may be EI because he mentioned the financing of a generator.
36	I don't want to waive anything until I track the business guy down.
36	Can you ask around and let me know.
36	Thanks!
37	The Icon worked and I've pulled it up and can use it.
37	Thanks for your help!
37	How's things going there?
37	Are you getting excited about going back home?
37	Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you?
37	Everything cool on the roommate front?
38	In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either party without consent.
38	We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.
38	Unless Federico has any reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up here and send it to Duke.
38	Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.
38	Thanks!
39	Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power deal with Duke.
39	You might want to get in touch with Federico.
39	Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of Argentina.
40	Pat, This waiver has to deal with a provision in the ECT master swap agreement that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential, except to certain people like auditors.
40	It did not allow the agreement to be provided to affiliates.
40	Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that is doing the deal down in Argentina.
40	Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's permission to give them a copy of the agreement.
40	That it what I am trying to resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.
40	Your issue, obviously, is what business Federico is doing.
40	My issue is more of a documentation/legal issue.
41	I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.
41	The presentation was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and swap agreement form templates.
41	I need to talk to our confirm desk people to see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were hoping this system could address.
41	They had one concept for form generation I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.
41	The concept was this "data dictionary".
41	It made it all clear to me.
41	I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come back to us before I leave for Europe in June.
42	It appears Susan Bailey still can not get in and edit the master swap agreement database.
42	She now has the icon, but no edit priviliges.
42	Can you please get her access.
42	Much thanks!
43	Attached is Annex B. Just tell them they need to fill in blanks in guaranty.
44	Attached is a sample ISDA Schedule.
44	Please remember to attach the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement.
44	Let me know if you have any questions.
45	Thanks for the update!
46	I still do not appear to be getting copies of all credit worksheets.
46	Please remember to keep me on this distribution.
47	So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan?
48	You are a star!
49	Just a reminder that I'm going to be in a little late tomorrow.
49	I'm going over to the old TCB Bank bldg.
49	at 9:00am to sign my loan papers.
50	ECT has a policy that prohibits employees from trading in any commodities that ECT trades.
50	Please make sure any future trading you may do complies with this policy.
50	Thank you.
51	John, it's good to hear from you!
51	A few things on your paralegal friend.
51	First, we don't currently have any openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.
51	Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.
51	Also, we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.
51	Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp. They do have a big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to start.
51	Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.
51	You could forward her resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.
51	Also, keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.
51	Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by Mary Solmonson.
51	They're always looking for people, and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.
51	Also, if her undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more options in other groups.
51	As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.
51	I'm just surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my mileage to 6.
51	It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.
51	But I do want to start training in July with Houston Fit for the Houston Marathon again.
52	We have received the above executed ISDA Master Agreements (Multicurrency-Cross Border) with the two referenced counterparties executed 05/25/99, effective as of 11/16/98.
52	Copies will be distributed.
52	I have also received in the originally signed confirmations and will be sending them down to Laurel Adams.
53	Per our conversation...thanks for your help!
54	I'm trying to track down that presentation for you, I need the directory information.
54	As soon as I get it I'll have it emailed to you.
54	Hope you're staying out of trouble...
55	I will pass on your "hello" to the rest of the group.
55	Of course we don't forget one of our favorite credit guys!
56	Thanks for your help!
57	This is from Mark Taylor's presentation he gave for Mark Haedicke at the ISDA Energy Seminar in Houston earlier this year.
57	I know Elizabeth Sager did a presentation last month for Mark H. he gave to some power group in D.C. Also, Mark T. is currently working on one for bandwith trading for Tom Gros.
58	Checking your mail, a Confidentiality Agreement came in from Greg Bruch, I gave him a call to see what his timing was, he said ite wasn't urgent, but if we could get an attorney looking at it, to get it final maybe next week.
58	It is counterparty's form, they would be the disclosing party, for a potential fiber source deal.
58	I am going to pass the agreement on to Carol for review, and will leave you a copy.
59	Working late, huh!?!
60	It appears that you are signed up for this class, and the confirmation and approval should go to you & Scott.
60	Remember that you will be charged if you do not cancel if you are not going to go (and the charge for canceling is pretty high, about $1000. There is no charge if you attend. Also, let me know if you don't get the proper approval forms.
61	Gracie, Thanks for your help!
62	Your message about the Canadian forms inspired me to visit with Mark.
62	We were in the middle of updating the Canadian forms, and Mark just gave me a few final changes, and as soon as I make those I'll email them up to you.
62	Actually we have two Canadian forms, the ISDA and the "Industrial".
63	You've received the whole thing.
63	Mark T. likes to ad lib a lot when he gives a presentation.
64	Thanks for your email.
64	I don't want to state the obvious because you appear to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from trading in anything the company trades in. Any trading you do for your own account must comply with this policy.
65	Fyi.
65	However, we need 7 file drawer files.
65	What do you think.
66	As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from time to time).
66	We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next week.
66	I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your attention.
66	One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.
66	The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.
66	We need to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they use the form.
66	Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms evolve without approval.
66	Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap agreement they approve.
66	It counts as a form change, not a negotiation change, if you make it in every agreement.
66	Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical component of the Fishkin Project).
66	Thanks for your attention to this.
67	You are the woman!
68	I have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of May 25, 1999.
68	This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current Confidentiality language.
68	This change will allow either party to provide copies of the agreement to its Affiliates.
68	Copies will be distributed.
69	I spoke to Mark Taylor today and he said that he spoke this week with a lawyer from, I believe Skadden, that had been hired by the OMLX to talk to ED&F Mann about the CFTC issue.
69	I think Mark Taylor is waiting to hear back from the Skadden lawyer.
70	The Legal/Credit Meeting scheduled for today is canceled due to the absence of Susan Flynn.
71	I'll pass on any other articles on the transportation industry that might be in our various derivatives magazines .
71	Glad you liked this one!
72	We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) executed 04/08/99, effective as of 06/09/98.
72	Copies will be distributed.
72	We also received the originally executed Confirmation, Deal # EM3927.1,2 & 3.
72	I will sent it down to the Confirmation Desk.
73	It appears this class is on a Sunday & a Monday.
73	Did I get this right?
74	Brenda Whitehead prepared that presentation and should be sending it to you.
75	Gracie, My confirmation of the class showed the 8/8 and 8/9.
75	You may want to go in and check your schedule.
76	We have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract files.
76	They have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of the documents in the files.
76	If they belong to anyone in your group they need to be claimed now, because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.
76	Can you have someone come
77	Why does it always have to be my deals...?!!!
78	Yeah!
79	Actually, bluebonnets bloom for a short time, maybe three week early in the Houston Spring, in March, after heavy Spring rains have gone on for a bit, and when the temperature is in the 60's to 70's.
79	They would get fried and fade in the heat of a Houston summer.
79	However, I don't know the temperatures and rain condition of your summers, and what time of your year would replicate those conditions.
80	I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.
80	Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.
80	It appears the date Fred signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing contractual documents without Legal's initials.
80	There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us: (1) they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.
80	Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.
80	We'll look at it some more after lunch.
80	On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign off on that change.
80	She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.
80	Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on too.
80	Are you also working on this?
80	So that's what's going on...
81	Now might be your time to plant!
81	I'm already miserable with the Houston summer heat.
81	It's already in the high 90's with high 90 humidity.
81	After 4-5 more months of this it's going to get pretty old!
81	How's little Sophie.
81	Any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me about?
82	I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.
82	I have also seen information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.
82	I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.
82	If you are unfamiliar with our company, Enron is the largest integrated marketer of energy in the United States.
82	We have a Web Page located at www.enron.com.
82	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. is the marketing affiliate of our parent, Enron Corp. I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you or a representative from you company in some depth.
82	I am located in Houston, Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.
82	Thank your for your attention herewith.
83	Thank you for your help.
83	I look forward to hearing from your U.S. person.
84	Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.
84	Liz Sager is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and needs to prepare a similar script for them.
84	If you could let me know who to contact I'd appreciate it.
84	Thanks for your help!
85	You be the man!
85	Can you email or fax the trader guidelines Scott is talking about.
85	Much thanks!
86	What ever happened to that CGAS certificate we were trying to get in connection with my swap agreement?
86	Last note I had was that resolution we were trying to get requires approval of Board for each trade and you were going to talk to Mark about how to resolve this.
86	Was it resolved?
87	Your big opportunity appears to be here!
87	Some guy in the for sale database under misc messages is looking to put together a team for the year 2000.
87	This is your big break...
88	Are we trading with the referenced counterparty?
89	Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke.
89	I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees.
89	Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?
89	We sent execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on the inactive status.
90	Oops, what a surprise!
90	When I went to file away my file on the CFTC Form 40, I noticed I already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had filed the form in 1995 and 1997.
90	Maybe we have to file these every other year?
91	What's your pleasure on the below guarantees?
92	In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing new "umbrella" guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options Inc. (a PG&E affiliate) These new guarantees will cover all physical, financial and power transactions between the above parties.
92	I have sent them the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.
92	Rod is resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.
92	In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees: (1) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT Canada.
92	I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. Prior Guarantees.
93	No, a transaction had been entered into, the Master Agreement to govern it was signed, getting the certificates was one of the requirements under the agreement.
94	Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty.
94	Please remember to fax the counterparty U.S. IRS Tax Forms 1001 and Form W-8.
94	Thanks.
95	Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.
95	All of our forms are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out soon.
96	Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was over there.
96	Thanks!
97	Can you email over to me your Paragraph 11 too!
97	Thanks again.
98	It's always nice to chat with you too!
98	I'd love to go to lunch, I'm going to put in on my calendar to call you when I get back so we don't forget until the next time we see each other.
99	I printed out the referenced list that you sent me, but it has some information on it that I don't think we necessarily want to show the NYMEX.
99	Specifically, your last two columns that show "cmbTaxType" and "tg/Active".
99	Is there any way you can reprint the list only showing the name of the corporation and the place of incorporation?
99	Thanks.
100	Here's an updated confirm on Saga.
100	Bernice is awaiting your approval.
101	There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to totally shut down our computers.
101	Supposedly this virus was all over the world.
101	Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.
101	I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and also Mark Taylor.
101	Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think our system issues are.
101	I've traded phone calls with Documentum.
101	I'm actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their presentation on our specific needs.
101	I've looked at your material for Micro Modeling.
101	I will be contacting them next.
101	I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.
101	I have another big project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full time to this project finally.
101	So that's my story, how are you?
102	Bob McInosh from Rock-Tenn called yesterday, and they did a trade with us and owe us money and he doesn't know where to send it.
102	His phone no.
102	is (770) 263-4456, fax.
102	(770) 248-4402.
102	If someone could contact him with our wire transfer instructions.
102	It will probably be in the confirm you send him.
103	Are we having your group meeting today?
103	Inquiring minds want to know...
104	I didn't havw any time off.
105	Melissa, I still need to return the prior PG&E guarantees referenced below to the counterparty.
105	Were you having them pulled?
106	Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.
106	I'm looking forward to the cooler weather.
106	I got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about buying a sweater!
106	I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one sitting!
106	My backyard is really looking good.
106	It's almost all planted, maybe 90% done.
106	I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).
106	It will be a while before they look like trees, though.
106	Right now they kinda look like tall bushes.
106	I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.
106	They're in pots, because I'll have to take them in during hard freezed.
106	I've planted lots of climbing pink, yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.
106	It will take a while before they fill out.
106	Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot of color.
106	Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over Houston.
106	I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds and butterflies.
106	I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit.
106	Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.
106	I need a little sun to make them bloom.
106	And then there's my St. Francis fountain.
106	He's just lovely!
106	Also, the central air is done.
106	No more noise from window units.
106	Now he's painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real pale pink.
106	I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can start cleaning up all the dust.
106	I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of the 4th of July holiday.
106	You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.
106	Have you been able to do anything?
106	I'm so glad I got to see your house.
106	Now when you talk about things I can picture what you're talking about.
106	Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.
106	I'm looking forward to that.
106	I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of poor Willow.
106	Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.
106	I'm sorry he didn't get a chance to see your car.
106	I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think I gave it justice.
106	It was good talking to you the other day!
106	I'll give you a call when I get back.
107	I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).
107	We won't get the letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.
107	I spoke to Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.
107	I'll pass on the approval letter and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter.
108	I have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to Melba Lozano on the Confirmation Desk for handling.
109	We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) effective as of 06/29/99.
109	Copies will be distributed.
109	IMPORTANT: All confirmations for this counterparty must contain the following representation: "Each party represents that it is in compliance with the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the board resolutions or other guidelines that are applicable to such party's execution and performance of this Transaction."
110	Melissa, I still need to forward over the documents listed below.
110	Have you, or someone in your group, been able to track them down.
111	I got it signed and Fedexed it up to ED&F Man for signature last night with instructions to send it back to me for transmittal to the OMLX.
111	Thanks for your help!
112	Anthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, you've got to have them somewhere there.
112	Maybe they're with some old Margie Wright files.
112	But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there.
113	It's about 1 1/2 hour drive outside of the City.
113	I think if you wanted to ride you would only be able to do it weekends.
113	Are you still interested?
114	I got back from vacation late Friday.
114	Our whole group got bumped from the flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.
114	Not a bad deal!
114	But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was exhausted.
114	Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover (and clean from my construction work).
114	I had a really nice time.
114	Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except for the flight out of Munich.
114	We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.
114	My favorite time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.
114	It was wonderful, I hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.
114	It is so hard to do anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.
114	Our hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast and dinner included!
114	Such a deal!
114	I got home and my house is almost done.
114	There are only a few minor things left.
114	The garden is at 85%.
114	My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.
114	I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I think (if the painter is done).
114	They are calico cats.
114	I haven't named them yet.
114	What's going on with you?
114	Are they working you to death?
114	Any fun things going on?
115	I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the approved swap forms there.
115	The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".
115	I hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.
115	Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them names like industrial-canadian, etc..
115	I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.
115	I am also moving forms we frequently use located mainly in my directory, but also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.
115	If there is a form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.
115	This should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office.
115	To the U.K. and Singapore: We are going through a form revision process here in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies of the changes to you for your review.
116	Michael is the person.
116	Keep me posted if you don't get access.
116	How are you?
116	How goes the weight training?
116	Don't be a stranger...
117	Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you a box of blue files and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you couldn't get those types of files in England).
117	One of our assistants got a call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.
117	So if you do want the blue files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the Atlantic again.
117	We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no big deal.
118	I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.
118	Now Erica has received back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).
118	Can you work out what supplies you want from us.
118	We are happy to order whatever you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what the supplies are worth.
118	Thanks.
119	Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the approval.
119	We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always contain the most current resolution.
120	I just wanted to let you know that Shari Stack is working on that Talisman letter.
120	It was good talking to you, as always.
120	I hope you got out and "stomped" a little bit!
121	Done.
122	I just wanted to check for one of our British attorneys who is coming into town next month to confirm he is registered for a seminar.
122	Do you have Mark Elliott registered for Derivatives I on August 8 and 9.
122	Can you confirm this for me so I can confirm it for him.
122	Thanks!
123	Just wanted to give you a head's up.
123	We received last night from ED&F Man their form of proposed Clearing Agreement with the OMLX.
123	It appears they simultaneously sent it to the OMLX.
123	I am having my assistant fax a copy to you.
123	I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this morning.
123	As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few weeks ago, and they've now come back with their form.
123	I don't know how customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?
123	Anyway, we'll take a look at it here and give you a call.
124	Below is my listing of the remaining projects.
124	1.
124	Finish painting sunroom.
124	2.
124	Paint bedroom furniture.
124	3.
124	Replace two front door thresholds.
124	4.
124	Put mailbox in Nancy & Peter's front door.
124	They have the hardware.
124	5.
124	Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's.
124	6.
124	Paint outdoor pipes same color as house.
124	7.
124	I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.
124	Bob asked if you could replace it for him and send him the bill.
124	8.
124	Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom plumbing.
124	That should do it!
125	I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.
125	The top of the Schedule says "Milbank Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.
125	Robina Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.
125	I would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.
125	Mark needs the computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in Houston.
125	Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.
125	I'd appreciate it.
126	I got the confirmation that you are signed up for Deriviatives I on Aug. 9 and 10, so you don't need to worry about it.
126	I will be taking the class too!
126	We are trying to track you down an office.
126	Our floor is completely full right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to do some shifting.
126	They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of space.
126	Something y'all can relate to there in London!
127	We have received the executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with Belco Oil & Gas Corp. dated as of July 8, 1999.
127	We have also received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein the trades under the existing Belco Operating Corp. Master Energy Price Swap Agreement will be assigned to the Belco Oil & Gas Corp. master.
127	No trading will continue under the Belco Operating Corp. master.
127	The two active Belco masters will be the Belco Oil & Gas Corp. master and the Belco Energy Corp. master.
127	Copies will be distributed.
128	Please add Carol St. Clair to the Credit Watch Lists for Houston and Canada.
129	Thanks for your help.
129	I really appreciate it!
129	Congrats on the new baby, how's she doing!?
129	Getting any sleep?
129	How's your son taking it?
129	Who does she look like?
130	You crack me up!
130	Your baby report made me laugh!
130	Keep me posted on how the kids are doing.
130	I enjoy your stories.
130	All my home improvements are about done.
130	I've finally put in central air, repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, including a fountain in the backyard.
130	It looks like a new house!
130	The final job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.
130	I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in a construction site.
130	I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be at it again for another winter.
130	I thought I had most of their holes for getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll probably have to go through it again this winter.
130	I vow to prevail!
130	Keep in touch...!
131	Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty is the protected party.
131	This form needs a little tweaking since it is more directed for a financing transaction.
131	Peter can find it, as well as other forms, in the attorney forms bank.
131	Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can be of further help.
132	Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.
132	We have the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements: Limitation of Rate.
132	Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party.
132	For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis.
132	Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?
132	Is there some special magic to the above highlighted language?
132	Thanks for your help.
133	Mark Elliott will be in the office from August 2 through September 23 (I believe).
134	I walked past that office and it still looked a little messy.
134	Is someone from Prjoect Rock going to clean it out?
135	In order to get you phone service here, the phone people want your passport number since you don't have a social security number.
135	Can you provide it to Joyce Dorsey, an assistant here in Legal.
135	She's working with Sylvia to get your office set up.
135	Thanks!
136	We have a list of the London attorneys and paralegals attached to our ECT Legal Dept. List that we maintain.
136	Do you want me to send you a list?
136	Where would you like me to send it to.
136	Do you want me to write on it, generally, their areas of responsibility are?
137	Attached is the language for insertion in the confirmation.
138	I spoke to Tanya and she said they only do energy trading through J. Aron, all the interest rate and currency trading is done through Goldman, so we don't need language re: that business.
138	Also, I ran it by her, and she does want the language in the credit rating section of the MAC about "not supported by third party credit enhancement."
139	I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest change question we asked him.
139	You'll see, he sent us both a fax with proposed changes to that section.
139	When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.
139	It wasn't a clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on this.
140	I'm still trying to get an appointment set up with the Documentum people.
140	One of the things I need to get from you is what is the current software you are using, so they know what software they've got to be compatible with.
140	Can you send me an email back.
140	Thanks.
141	I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the counterparty.
141	If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.
141	1.
141	Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of Enron Power Marketing (this would have covered physical power, not financial).
141	I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is taken care of.
142	Not much going on.
142	I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration for me.
142	I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to call me.
142	I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.
142	Then the fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford their services.
142	When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that they've done their homework.
142	They're about to lose my business.
142	In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our own software.
142	I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the project.
142	The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for document creation more attractive.
143	I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB H3B 5G2.
143	The contact is Theresa Pace (French pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.
143	I spoke to Harry Arora about it, and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.
143	So when you have a minute, let's talk about what to do.
144	I still need to see you about that Market Disruption summary for the Husky Oil Global Contract Datasheet so I can close up that file.
145	Try talking to Nadeem Tufail in London.
145	I believe he is a paralegal that is responsible for their corporate filings.
146	I forgot one thing.
146	I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or whatever it is, and then painting that.
146	Do you remember?
146	By the way, I can't believe you're alive.
146	By the way you've been quiet, I thought you were maybe in that plane too...!
147	That's the point, it wasn't on my list!
147	I remembered when I was standing there looking at the garden and saw the rotted board.
147	Also, there is a skootch of repainting that needs to be done on the same garage wall.
147	You didn't tell me the bathroom you were working on for your other "client" was Michelle's!
148	I know you are just a spy so she can keep track of the progress of my garden.
148	Why, just the other day I came home from work and caught her in my backyard!!
149	Fix all!
149	I need to tell Peter and Nancy when you'll be in their apartment.
150	Yes, you can fax me the invoice and statement.
151	Tracy, is there some particular reason I'm getting this notice?
151	Debra Perlingiere is the paralegal that does the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements.
152	Per your request.
153	I left a message with both Clement Abrams and his paralegal, Carol Essig, about the information you are requesting.
153	I told them you needed an immediate response.
153	If you don't hear from them within the next 1/2 hour let me know.
154	I'm going to try someone else.
155	Mark Taylor asked me to respond to your request about the OMLX software.
155	I spoke to Mark Elliott in our London office who dealt directly with the OMLX.
155	He said to contact Susan Gill at the OMLX, who we spoke to on the agreements, and she should be able to direct you to their software people.
155	Her number in London is 011 44 171 815 8510.
155	Let me know if I can be of further service.
156	Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies that can check company names in Europe and Canada.
156	In the U.S. we can access this information via Westmate in Westlaw.
156	Are either of you aware of any online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an online search company, for Canada and Europe?
156	If there are no online search companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company that can verify this information for us?
156	I appreciate your help.
157	Thanks to you and Scott for your help, I appreciate it!
157	I hope all is going well...
158	Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.
158	I'd be interested to see what prices we can work out.
158	I am also going to contact Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.
158	If Enron Corp. does and they have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.
158	I'll keep you posted.
159	Per the memo below, we are looking for European and Canadian corporate search companies, and it occurred to me that you may already have someone you use.
159	Do you have any recommendations?
159	Thanks for your help!
160	I'll have to go get one this weekend.
161	I'm helping Alan Aronowitz out with a presentation he has to give on the global energy markets and I was thinking that Paul recently did a presentation and maybe there might be some good slides on the European markets that I can pull in. Can you locate, or find someone to locate, Paul's presentation, and email it to me.
161	I hope you get out of work at a decent hour today.
161	I bet you could use a beer with all the late nights you've been putting in. How's the house going?
161	Thanks for your help!
162	I am getting ready to fax you the Cancellation Agreement which has been executed by an officer of ECT.
162	I have two originally executed copies which I would like to overnight to you for execution and I need your address.
162	Can you please email it back to me.
162	Much thanks!
163	Per Lisa Mellencamp, can you add my name to the list of counterparties who are either bankrupt or in workout.
163	I understand that you will have a list by the end of the day.
163	Thanks.
164	Louis, The brother of the kids downstairs is renovating a house in the Heights and needs an electrician to rewire or do a new fuse box or something.
164	Do you think that your electrician would want to give them a bid on the job, or do you have someone else to recommend?
164	They hired someone, who has in effect, taken their money and run, and their house sits, unable to proceed on the rest of the renovation work, until they can get the electric work done.
164	Thanks.
165	The question of the day is, do you have access to our Lotus Notes Database?
166	You are a star!
166	When are you going to get back to Houston?
166	There's problems going on right and left at Enron I think we need to solve!
167	Mike, How can Brent get access to our Master Swap Agreement database from EI in Argentina?
167	Thanks for your help.
168	I am going to have more names to give you from Argentina.
168	Actually, I need to give access to a number of people to different areas of the swap database.
168	I am in a seminar the rest of today, but when I get back I'll email you or give you a call about the access.
169	Alan Aronowitz is working on a presentation he has to give in Singapore on Global Energy Derivatives, and wanted to put a little blurb in of some kind about weather.
169	He wanted to see if he could get a copy of the presentation you and Mike Corbally gave at the ISDA seminar to see if there were any slides that might be helpful for his presentation.
169	Do you have a copy I can provide him?
169	Thanks!
170	The ISDA Multicurrency Agreement Schedule has been approved and moved into the attorney forms bank.
170	It is located at o:legal\atty.fms\swaps\current The old ISDA Multicurrency Agreement Schedule is located at
171	Mark and I made some changes to conform the confidentiality provisions in the ISDA and Industrial Master Agreements that he wants me to run by you, (1) adding financial institutions to ISDA (or deleting from Industrial), and (2) adding same language to ISDA that we added to Industrial "...and each of such persons" auditors, attorneys, etc.
172	Tanya called and asked me to get ready for Catalytica, and prepare the Annex B, pending approval of the deal.
172	I have it ready and am just waiting to hear we're ready to send it down.
173	We have received a copy of an executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated July, 20, 1999, as amended August 3, 1999, effective on August 12, 1999, wherein Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. assigned certain transactions to J. Aron and Company.
173	A copy of the assignment will be distributed.
174	Per our meeting, we need you to (i) check whether you had "Total Premium" or "Premium" in your online confirmation, and (ii) give me some language re: online trading procedures for the confirmation procedures section.
174	Thanks!
175	We have dinner reservations for Tuesday the 24th at 7:30 pm.
176	Just a reminder that if you change any of the resolutions contained in our Swap Resolutions Notebook, you need to update the Index, and substitute the revised resolutions into each of the Swap Group's persons Notebooks.
176	These would include for any of the trading companies, the resolutions that approve what we trade (which also includes who can sign the appropriate documents), as well as the brokerage approval resolutions.
176	It does not include the Confirmation signatories.
177	Nope...
178	I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based weather confirmations.
178	As soon as I have that information available, I will plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.
178	Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of approved jurisdictions for derivatives.
178	Is it ready yet?
178	Can I get a copy of it?
178	I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.
178	Thanks!
179	Attached is the proposed draft of the ISDA.
179	I think two substantive issues we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting "Affiliates" from the setoff section (which we agreed to in the original).
179	With all the bankruptcies going on right now Carol feels that we should at least make a stab at keeping Affiliates in. Let me know if the draft is OK to send out.
180	Just an FYI, did you notice that the NYMEX is applying to the CFTC to get a new electricity contract approved, the Mid-Columbia.
181	The revised form of ISDA exhibit.doc (which contains the credit support annex and letter of credit forms) has been moved into the attorney forms bank under atty.fms/current forms/isdaexh.doc.
181	The old form of ISDAexh.doc is now under "old forms" in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldISDAexh.doc.
181	Again, per my last email, the revised Multicurrency Schedule is already in attorney forms.
181	You may want to circulate blacklined drafts.
181	The Index to the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your reference for the most current forms.
181	It is called "formlist.doc."
181	London and Singapore, FYI, in addition to making changes to the ISDA collateral annex, we made changes to the MAC definitions (which we inserted into ISDAexh.doc for ease of the paralegals) and made changes to the letter of credit terms, as well as the form of Letter of Credit.
181	We also added in an alternative "Credit Support Amount" provision on the front page of the ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement.
181	We moved the guaranty forms (Enron Corp. and Counterparty) as a separate document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc.
181	The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed the procedures for timing of demands made on Enron (deleting the 15 day period).
181	We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the Enron Corp. guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.
181	We are close to finalizing changes to the Industrial Master, as well as making changes to the Omnibus form of confirmation.
181	Also, by the end of the day I will have moved our standard forms of Secretary's Certificates into the attorney forms bank.
182	Peter, We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.
182	I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.
182	When you get a minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your approval.
182	Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised one (which is #1 documents below).
182	Can you print them out for Peter.
182	Thanks!
183	I still haven't received that list you mentioned of counterparties in bankruptcy or workout.
183	What's the scoop?
184	I have it, it is in the Swaps library.
185	Per your request, attached is the form of Duke Capital Corporation Guaranty.
186	The execution documents were sent over to Duke Energy yesterday.
186	I spoke to them this morning and they we going to forward the documents internally for signature.
186	I, or Marie upon her return from vacation, will keep you posted on the progress of execution.
187	Ask and you shall receive...
188	Julian, The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.
188	I don't know if what they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation filled in with the proposed deal terms.
188	I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.
188	As soon as I hear from her I'll get her what she needs.
188	If you have any more questions, email me back, or call.
188	I'm at your service!
189	Is anyone working on a confirmation for the Argentina office for a swap between ECT and Duke Energy International out of Argentina, Don Black would be the business person on this.
189	If you know, I need to get the draft faxed ASAP to Duke here in Houston.
190	So far as much as I've been able to track, the Houston Confirmation Desk does not know about this Duke Confirm yet.
190	Don, can you contact Dale Neuner on the Confirmation Desk ASAP with the proposed deal terms so he can prepare the Confirm and get it sent over to Duke.
190	Thanks!
191	Mike, have you been able to figure out how to get Brent Hendry, who is now in Buenos Aires, access to our Master Swap Agreement database?
191	Can you let me know.
191	I'm getting bugged about this.
192	August 30 is fine for lunch.
193	Tobin, You don't need to keep Taffy on the list about our volume positions.
193	She is mine and Mark's assistant and just prints out the forms for us.
193	She really doesn't need to know the specific position limits in the form.
194	Looks good!
194	Thanks!
195	Brent, I am having this woman with Duke here in Houston, Roni Cappadonna, calling me wanting to get the form of the confirmation.
195	I don't know what to tell her.
195	Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to wait until the trade is done?
195	I think the person that really needs to be handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.
195	I am kinda just in the middle of the confirm thing.
195	Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing with Roni.
196	Per Steven Vu's message, I still haven't received the info we need to complete the online weather GTC's.
196	Any word on when we can expect it?
197	Have you done deals in the UK and France that we should use as our model?
198	For the online trading project, I am trying to track down for the U.K., the Datasource, Reporting Service, and Reporting Agency for the GTC.
198	I understand that you might either have that information or be able to direct me to someone who does.
198	I appreciate whatever help you can give me!
199	Per a head's up from Tanya, LG&E Power Marketing was merged into LG&E Energy Marketing and is no longer an active corporation.
199	Take it off the executed master list.
200	Per our conversation, I am attaching a sample form of online weather GTC.
200	As we discussed, I am trying to complete the information for "Datasource" and under "Floating Amount" for Reporting Service and Reporting Agency for the U.K. Thanks for your help!
201	I'm still looking for that list of approved European countries for online trading.
201	Any word...?
202	I just wanted to let you know, I've got calls into Duke about the executed master and haven't heard back yet.
202	I will give you and Brent a call as soon as I hear something.
203	Thanks!
203	I'll get Lavo's title changed.
203	I spoke to our buddy in London this morning.
203	He seems to be doing wonderful, as usual.
203	He and Sue are getting ready to buy a new house in Twickenham, four bedrooms, garage (so he can park his new convertible home instead of across town) on the river.
203	It sounds really nice.
203	He has been traveling alot.
203	Weddings almost every weekend for months.
203	Rowing.
203	That about sums it up.
203	I ran into Gaffer for the 1st time in months.
203	By his traveling schedule, I think we've really hired him to be a door to door salesman.
203	I heard the Mounties have arrived for you.
203	Your new lawyer has started.
203	Congrats!
204	Very good!
205	Mark Taylor asked me to run something on Online Trading by you.
205	We got a list of questions on various Online Trading issues from the Products Control Group which appears to be the group the will be managing the Online Trading HelpDesk.
205	One of their questions related to the desire of HelpDesk managers to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what they explained as a "quality control" over the responses given to customers on the HelpDesk.
205	They explained it as being like when your credit card company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to time.
205	Is this something we want to do?
205	If we do, that brings up other issues, and we will have to run this by our outside counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell.
205	Can you let me know your thoughts...Thanks!
206	Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.
206	Per the list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at the Paris address.
206	We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France where we used their Toulouse address.
206	I just wanted to confirm that the address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of Paris, not Toulouse.
206	If you'll just confirm that for me.
207	In response to our comments from yesterday's form meeting, I am saving the Industrial in my forms directory, now as #5 draft.
207	If you have to draft one let me know, and we'll figure out which form to work off of.
208	FYI
209	Per our meeting, attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's incorporating the tax language and completing the Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Data Source information.
210	FYI, for your Gibraltar deal.
210	I am going to save this in attorney.fms, current forms.
211	Thanks for your help!
211	Are you getting back from vacation?
211	How's your house coming?
211	I know you are really busy, but if you get a free minute I'd love to hear the scoop...
212	Nikki, How do we dial that number from the US?
212	Is there a particular country code we have to use?
212	Thanks for your help!
213	I really appreciate your help!
214	As you requested...
215	Who is Molly Matheso?
216	FYI
217	FYI
218	FYI, I just sent this to the paralegals, but then I though y'all would like to know who Molly is too.
219	I have made Sunday brunch reservations for September 12th at Brennan's for noon.
219	Be there or be square...
220	We have received the following executed documents from counterparty: 1.
220	First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 04/27/99 between ECT and Engage Energy US, L.P. (i) making certain changes to setoff provisions and (ii) changing Counterparty's exposure threshold; and 2.
220	ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) between ECT Canada and Engage Energy Canada, L.P. executed 05/03/99, effective as of 01/31/97.
220	Copies will be distributed.
221	Just an update on the status of the signing.
221	As of Friday, Duke supposedly had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty.
221	Clement Abrams, Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their concerns.
221	He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and give me the original for transmittal.
221	I'll keep you posted on how things progress...
222	Scott, Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer responsible for Norway power contracts.
222	Mary is the head of Global Contracts here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.
222	Thanks for your help!
223	I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.
223	There was also a few updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.
223	If and when Mark calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it.
224	I'm passing on for response.
225	I noticed the memo too, and looked around this morning for the attachments that went with them, but couldn't find them.
225	When Mark calls in I'll ask him what happened to the attachments.
226	We have completed the revisions to anexb.doc (the document used to prepare credit for omnibus confirmations).
226	It has been moved into the attorney forms bank and is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/anexb.doc.
226	The prior form has been moved to atty.fms/swaps/old forms/oldanexb.doc.
227	Attached is that chart that were supposed to replace with the current one on price volatility.
227	I tried to open it up, but it was all gobbeldy gook.
227	Maybe you could print it out for me and then I could take a look at it and if it looks OK we could just replace it with existing one.
227	Thanks!
228	Thanks, I appreciate your help!...will I be able to get it tomorrow?
229	Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response.
229	Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.
229	Per your voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have reviewed.
229	I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I will hear from him tonight or not.
229	If youcould email or fax me the document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I hear back from him.
229	I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark.
230	Per a call from Rod today, our executed master list hasn't picked up the following name change: Lomak Petroleum Inc. to Range Resources Corporation.
230	Thanks!
231	Attached is the Annex B for Catalytica.
232	Per the request of Sara, I am attaching Annex A and Annex B to the Omnibus Confirmation for the referenced counterparty.
233	Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.
233	Per Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product areas to be traded online.
233	So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 12 descriptions.
233	I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant Legal group when I receive them.
233	Per the attached email, Awais needs our Legal sign off by Friday.
233	I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in his group.
233	I'm not sure who that would be.
233	Could you let me know?
233	Mark asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper description for our group.
233	Thanks for your help!
234	I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with the descriptions.
234	I understand your deadline is the end of the week.
234	When can I expect the remaining descriptions?
235	Yes!
236	Attached is Annex A for the Omnibus, revised only to change "ECT" to "ENA".
237	Per your request, I am attaching the Executed Masters List.
237	Please feel free to call me anytime I can be of help!
238	Per our discussion, the email for that website is www.utilityconnection.com.
239	Mark, There has never been a time in our Group before where any member of our Group was cut off from mass distributions that were sent to all of our client base and member of the Group but me.
239	If the intent is to cut me off and make me feel isolated from the Group and my friends, clients and customers and associates it is working!
240	Ditto as to my feelings of isolation and punishment.
241	If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.
241	I think Mark's input is the most important.
242	Per the request of Bill Bradford, I am attaching our standard Material Adverse Change clauses.
243	On your counterparty list for the UK, have you identified which counterparties are utilities or governmentals?
243	If you have that would help me alot.
243	Thanks!
244	Bob, Per your request, attached are the online trading GTC's.
244	It looks like Mark has all of them, not just financial.
244	I'm going to talk to Stacy about this when she gets in, because I know she was talking about adding it in. I'll get back to you.
245	Here are the next four descriptions.
245	Per Awais's message below, he is still trying to get these by today.
245	I know it is a little late....let me know if this will be an issue.
245	Please give me your comments so I can coordinate responses.
245	Thanks!
246	Mark Taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following market descriptions.
246	Obviously, for you, the weather one is yours, I sent the pulp & paper to Sara.
246	We need to review the market descriptions from a legal perspective only.
246	Awais is trying to get them back by today.
246	Let me know if that will present a problem.
246	He still hasn't got the liquids ones written, he says we'll have those by Monday.
246	I am coordinating the responses, so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal to Awais.
246	Thanks for your help!
247	The MAC clauses are attached to the ISDA Master Agreement.
247	I will have a sample copy walked down to you.
248	I have no idea if it was or not.
248	Would you like to pass it on, or do you want me to?
248	Does he know what's going on?
249	Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of these descriptions.
249	They are being forwarded to our business people now for review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday being a federal holiday here).
249	I don't know what problems this is going to cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business input on these descriptions.
249	Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster to this effect.
250	Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business groups for approval.
250	If we are duplicating your work, or doing something contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try to coordinate our responses.
250	Otherwise, we will continue the review we are doing.
251	Here's the final liquids descriptions!
252	Alan, is this what you are talking about?
252	I forwarded your voicemail on to Mark T.
253	Attached are the revised descriptions for SO2 and NOX.
253	Jeff Hodge signed off on the Canada description and said it looked fine in its current form.
253	I will be faxing you this evening our comments to Natural Gas.
253	You should have received weather by separate email from Shari Stack.
253	Coal should be coming shortly, paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it to you on Tuesday.
253	The person responsible for power is out of the office, but will be back in town on Tuesday, and we will get you her comments then.
253	Thank you for your kind patience.
254	FYI
255	I will be attending the online presentation today at 4.
256	Here's coal.
256	That just leaves power and any revisions to pulp & paper we may get from the business people.
257	I will have the master walked down to you shortly.
258	Thursday's OK with me.
259	I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney in our group, Shari Stack.
259	If that is the one you are talking about, it should be okay.
259	I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling Steve Kean and see if I get a response.
260	Shari, Can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know if its ok.
260	Thanks.
261	I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all these descriptions done was the end of today.
261	She said she would pass the word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.
261	Let me know if that doesn't happen.
262	Either day is fine for me.
263	De nada!
264	I guess I still need your market descriptions for LPG, Oil & Oil Products and Plastics and Petrochem.
264	Will I have them by the end of the day?
265	Thanks Shari!
266	I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.
266	Steve Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.
266	Not as to legal.
266	He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her comments to me for forwarding to you.
266	I will let you know as soon as I receive your comments.
267	Were you serious about our conversation Friday, or were you kidding me?
267	If you were serious I'd like to talk to you about it.
268	After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received it.
268	With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me with this?
268	Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract numbers for our financial masters?
268	Thanks!
269	Below is the memo from ISDA that needs to be read in conjunction with that Master Netting Agreement.
270	Here are the descriptions again.
271	Taffy, you were going to check on how much vacation days I have left.
271	I wanted to take a few days when my mom comes in for XMAS.
271	Thanks.
272	I checked around and that is the most recent copy we have.
272	If I can be of any help whatsoever, let me know!
273	How about Thursday, next week?
274	I got Edward's markup of the description, and wanted to run it by you when you have a minute.
274	Let me know...
275	Thanks for your help!
276	Thanks Bob.
276	The couch is always open, tho' (obviously!) not always helpful!
277	List looks good to me!
278	I didn't know you sent the market description to Awais, so I was following up.
278	I'll mark it out.
279	Here are your three remaining descriptions.
279	Please note that Harry has asked that Mark Taylor review the plastics description.
279	Mark is out of the office and will not return until Monday.
280	Awais, I sent you all these.
280	What happened to them!
281	All the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to Awais and I have asked him to provide them to you.
281	I understand you have weather which was faxed.
282	Mike, You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and that appears not to have happened yet.
282	Can you please let me and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.
282	Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.
282	Brent, can you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals (Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.
282	Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a document tracking database in B.A.
282	Who should he contact here to get a new database created similar to ours?
282	Thanks for your help!
283	Brent, I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.
283	If we don't get you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.
283	Hope you are doing well...we miss you!
284	I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our meeting.
284	I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and haven't heard.
284	In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 days.
284	So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like to change that to 365/366 accross the board.
284	I asked them if there was any specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's the custom in the bank/dealer markets.
284	Anyway, I'd like to get that answered.
285	I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been gone.
285	I think Stacy has created new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the reps.
285	I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David Forster.
285	Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP issues.
286	We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to the back of the Industrial Master.
286	It is still located in my form directory, called industrial-u.s.#5.doc.
287	I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.
287	We really do have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response.
288	It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the latest.
288	Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.
288	Can you email me the latest draft.
288	Thanks!
289	Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT Canada that went into bankruptcy.
289	It shows up on my list because I'm working off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.
289	I just want to make sure that we don't send them any mailouts.
290	Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.
290	I hope there was no frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...!
291	I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).
291	It's at www.utilityconnection.com.
291	It even has non-U.S. utilities.
291	When you have a minute, give it a look.
292	Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for ECT Canada.
292	The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in place, and we have to provide them copies.
292	See me and I'll show you how to do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.
292	Thanks!
293	Here are the descriptions for power.
294	Sent again.
295	Sign off on Canada.
296	It turns out that Jeff Hodge made plane reservations for 1:30 pm on Wednesday.
296	Can we move that meeting up to 11:00 am?
297	We have dinner reservations for Saturday at 7:30.
297	Reservation #189.
298	I will be able to attend.
299	Access to the online trading system?
299	If that's the questions, probably none of us.
300	There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.
300	This project continues to be highly confidential.
301	For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need your help and your list to be able to do that.
301	I am totally unfamiliar with the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not.
301	I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals.
301	I've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental.
301	Is your list done, or when will it be done?
301	Do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility?
301	What help can you give me?
302	Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us with no changes.
302	NOX and SOX are attached also.
303	I am also reforwarding the coal description.
304	FYI
305	I noticed we have 2 entries for cpy in Lotus Notes.
305	We need to delete one.
306	Mark, David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not so sure it's correct.
306	We think it should reflect two huge power price spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.
306	We don't think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.
306	Can you take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help!
307	Per the meeting today, attached is the latest counterparty list in Excel.
308	Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty list.
308	I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's approved counterparty list here in Houston.
309	Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, state of incorporation.
309	The biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading will take place).
309	For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap trading.
309	It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.
309	With utilities, you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another.
309	Each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.
309	The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.
309	I know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.
309	You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.
310	I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about discussing any other financial issues we might have then...
311	I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at.
311	You may want to get it from her.
311	It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there also.
312	Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.
312	It's got the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without Citibank's consent.
312	Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT International).
312	Sorry...
313	I'm a little confused.
313	Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) both?
314	I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc.
315	Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.
315	I don't know how long mail takes to get there.
315	It will probably be there I hope in today's mail.
316	I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement database.
316	I understand that you are the person that can get them access.
316	This will continue to be an issue as we expand our trading offices around the world.
316	Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent and Andrea access.
316	Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.
316	How does Brent go about getting this new database created?
316	Thanks for your help!
317	Carol made some proposed changes to the MAC language and asked me to send it to you to get your input.
318	Mary, although this presentation is for the Legal Dept. I thought maybe if you have a representative from your group there it might be helpful.
318	Do you have someone, like Mary Gosnell, that you would like to attend?
318	Let me know, and I'll get their name added to the list.
319	Have you sent these to Steve Kean?
320	The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour until 2:30 pm.
321	If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.
321	We're always looking for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!
321	How are you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well as others...!
322	We do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files.
322	Can you have one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees, credit support documents, etc. Much thanks...
323	Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.
323	So, I'll work with Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal team for approval.
324	Thanks for the material.
324	I've been really busy at work.
324	At some point when I have more of a break I'll call you.
325	Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English culture, the Morris Men.
325	I've got their website bookmarked.
325	Y'all are a goofy bunch.
325	Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with switches.
325	It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English culture to me.
325	I am constantly amused!
325	If y'all would only cheer at marathons...!
326	Shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those documents (Deemed ISDA, legal opinions, etc.) I distributed a while back?
327	Here's that email....!
328	I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online trading.
328	Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.
328	Should Singapore be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?
328	Are there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the governmentals, such as the utilites?
328	Are there any products that might not be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others?
328	Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our agreements?
328	Any guidance you could give us with this would be most appreciated!
328	How are you and the baby doing?
328	We hope to see pictures on your next trip over!
329	Thank you for the lunch invite.
329	I put on the calendar..."lunch w/sweet yao".
329	Can't wait!
330	Non-Smoking Room please.
330	Preferably a suite with a wet bar, sunken tub, view over the pool, and complimentary room service.
330	Not to mention my own private valet.
331	Well, Mr. Elliott, I do believe I am quite shocked at your allegations of me being the troublemaker.
331	My review hasn't gone in yet and I guess I am going to have to mention...that you are the troublemaker!
332	Wonderful job!
333	Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on France and utility counterparties.
333	Any update?
334	What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until we get a new certificate?
335	How was your trip back?
335	I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.
335	The grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.
335	The bright lights of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.
335	Your visit seemed all too short.
335	We probably won't see you for a few years, but I really enjoyed our dinners and chats.
335	Stay out of trouble and make us proud!
336	The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements.
337	The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some time.
337	The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to the gents and is becoming quite the rage.
337	Fashion trends are quite slow in reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.
337	Has this trend crossed the Atlantic?!
337	Has Justin bought a pair in red?
337	We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch!
338	Taffy, can you work with Nicola to get this conf.
338	call set up with London, in Suzanne's absence.
338	Thanks!
339	I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.
339	Obviously, everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.
339	She looked up Gary Bode, who Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.
339	She suggested for the Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, or Chris Behney.
339	(She said we could have her, but she would be very expensive!...just kidding!) I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.
339	Perhaps we should set up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make sure we get a good person assigned to us.
339	What do you think?
340	You forgot to have me off the week of Thanksgiving too.
340	I know I mentioned that to you...
341	No word?
342	I have noticed that humility is one of your most pronounced character traits!
342	Am glad you responded and look forward to seeing you...
343	Per our conversation, the additional "to do" list is: 1.
343	plumber still needs to do his stuff 2.
343	put up new light fixture in back bedroom 3.
343	fix broken window in Peter & Nancy's front bedroom.
343	You'll need to call them to let them know the day you're doing it.
344	I'm out Tues.
344	and Weds.
344	at an in house seminar.
344	How does today or Thursday sound?
345	When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".
345	As you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with their commodity business.
345	Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the "assignment".
345	Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?
345	I don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.
345	What should I do?
346	Per David Forster, they should be doing the online trading simulation tomorrow.
347	Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades thereunder.
347	So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.
347	So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put: "Need board resolution prior to trading"
348	To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists: Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.
348	As noted below, an additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.
348	FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week.
349	I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.
349	Do you need me to make you a copy or are you also getting updates?
349	Also, I get faxes of all their notices.
349	So far nothing I've received has been interesting.
349	Do you get copies of their notices?
349	Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth noting?
349	They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and ask Mark for a raise to match my title!
350	I thought of you this weekend.
350	It was the fall antique festival in Round Top and I went, but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day I had with you and your family.
350	That was such a perfect day all around and I will treasure it.
350	I hope all is going well....
351	So I don't forget for Monday, Shari just send around the Canadian "eligible swap participant" language to be inserted in all Canadian confirms.
351	Don't we also need to add that to the Canadian online GTC's?
352	Yes, the list is the final approved counterparty list before the roll out of the system.
352	All counterparty lists are due by the close of business tomorrow.
352	If you are not sure of what the current approved counterparty lists are let me know.
353	Do not worry about that new product type.
353	It doesn't pertain to you.
353	If you see none that looks like power you might want to pay attention.
353	I know Jeff has been getting similar emails.
354	The document wasn't in the blue file either.
354	I called Tanya and asked her if she could fax us up a copy of it.
354	Also, I asked her to let you know what her thoughts were on the proposed amendment.
354	Do you want me to call Rick at BMO and let him know you're working on it?
355	Just a confirmation, we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the upcoming conference: you, Justin, Paul and Jon.
355	Is that correct?
356	See Lotus Notes
357	Lovely note, crummy master.
357	It makes Belco look good!
357	I know Olin Corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp I went to in North Carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains where the camp was located.
357	That plant manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were making in North Carolina.
357	I kinda remember them being a plastics company back then.
358	Attached is the latest draft of the referenced GTC.
359	Font of useless knowledge!
360	Would you like to respond?!
361	Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently being negotiated.
361	The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto (like legal opinions).
362	We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers still have not received notification of our name change.
362	This is causing problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.
362	Per my voicemail several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the brokers, they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.
362	When will you be able to get this notice our of our name change?
363	I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they can't file that form until they receive the notice from us.
364	How can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email?
365	We have tried to get the computer people to respond to your request for Lotus Notes access, but they don't respond.
365	Mark, what do you think the next step is?
366	Mark, open up felix the cat.
366	He is adorable!
367	As far as your email questions, my responses are following: 1.
367	The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties.
367	There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
367	2.
367	Duke Energy Corporation.
367	At Mark's direction, I am sending his note below regarding utilities.
367	Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to.
367	We currently have masters in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.
367	We are in the process of negotiating another 30.
367	Until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot approve them for online trading.
367	I have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not.
367	If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or federal regulation.
367	Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
367	3.
367	Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility.
367	I am unable to determine from Credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to.
367	The note is true that Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
367	4.
367	Petrotemex.
367	Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions.
367	We will not know this until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
367	5.
367	PSEG.
367	It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an eligible swap participant (or "ESP").
367	CFTC regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, banks, etc).
367	Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.
367	Whenever I say "not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the financial net worth test.
367	6.
367	The American Coal Company.
367	See prior note.
368	Attached are the revised online GTC's.
368	The weather GTC's won't change except for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's.
369	Did we order that special UK sized paper?
369	I still have to copy that OMLX stuff for Mark Elliott's binder there in London.
370	Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.
370	His work was top notch, his subcontractors did a great job.
370	For instance, I put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in front of my house.
370	I thought when the brick got repaired I would have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.
370	Louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.
370	Also, his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.
370	You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.
370	Louis is also a good businessman.
370	He gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.
370	A lot of contractors are not good businessmen.
370	I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his additional time or money on.
370	To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay.
371	The 1st list attached here is the one I used for the 1st list you have.
372	Per my voicemail, below are the revised online GTC's.
372	Sorry for an inconvenience this might have caused you.
373	I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today.
373	He will only be in the office Mon.
373	and Tues.
373	of next week, so if possible, he would like to set up a demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us through the software.
373	Let me know when a convenient time would be for you, maybe Tuesday sometime?
374	A reminder for when you get back on Monday!
375	I spoke to Mark Taylor.
375	How does Tuesday at 11:00 am sound?
376	11:00 am Central Standard Time (1 hour earlier than New York).
377	What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?
377	Brant says we're in a strong negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to take in those Howard trades.
377	He wants to know if he should use our leverage here to get that ISDA Master in place.
378	Just a note, if you've got some recent pictures of your daughter to bring them...
379	Attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's.
380	Anita sent me the message below re: board resolutions to trade out of Singapore.
380	Can Singapore trade out of the board resolution that was approved for ECT Interntional, or are we going to have to get another board resolution signed allowing financial trading out of the Singapore office?
381	Per our discussion...
382	I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board resolution.
382	He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.
382	With none of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in getting it signed here?
382	Who will you have sign the agreement?
382	What do you usually do?
383	Edmund, Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.
383	I don't know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, ECTRIC can sign directly.
383	Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, Managing Director or Chairman.
383	It looks like the London based officers who could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.
383	It looks like for the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's signature.
383	Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for signature, as also will your London Credit person.
383	Congrat Anita!
383	This is very exciting!
384	No, I haven't met Matt, in fact, I don't know much about him.
384	Is he here now?
384	For how long?
384	Thru the Legal Conference?
384	I would be happy to help in whatever way I can.
384	As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.
384	I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.
384	You have been wonderful to work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.
384	Your baby's gain in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our company.
384	I hope our lives will cross again some time!
384	Best wishes for your future, you deserve the best!
385	Mark, should we forward Carol's email to Bill, so he knows what the issues are?
386	Regulatory made some changes to the power description and Awais wanted Legal's sign off again and needs a response by tomorrow.
386	Will that be a problem?
387	With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: insurance/reinsurance company issues.
387	Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.
387	The online people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.
387	They are wanting to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins.
387	we are currently trading with without a master in place.
387	Do you have a list of those companies?
387	What are your feelings about that?
387	Can we trade online with Swiss Re?
387	How about any other insurance companies you are currently trading with without a master in place?
387	Or do you want me continue to say no?
387	Thanks for your help!
388	I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable!
388	What a cutie!
388	I've bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates.
389	I'd like to attend!
390	Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the online trading issues.
390	We have to get similar letters out to some of the South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.
390	Much thanks!
390	By the way, weren't you out for vacation?
390	Did you have a good time?
391	Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.
391	I have some minor clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from Christian Yoder in our Portland office.
391	As soon as I receive Christian's comments I will add forward them on to you.
392	It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of online transactions?
393	I have forwarded on your email and fax to Marie Heard.
393	She was already working on that issue, what a happy coincedence!
394	When are you coming in?
394	When shall we have dinner?
395	We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the online trading issue.
395	I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original advice.
395	Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for advice?
396	Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.
396	The two issues out of the meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were: 1.
396	Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.
396	Per our discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations.
396	That does not seem to be the general consensus.
396	There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going to do.
396	Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts.
396	2.
396	The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.
396	First, after our discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a "B" approved GTC with credit.
396	Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to him.
396	I guess the physical people are OK with that.
396	I don't know what discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him.
396	Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.
396	Who will be drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups?
397	Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the updates below.
397	Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday.
398	Shari, per the emails below, have you received or do you have any other advice we need to add?
399	Thanks for the smiles!
399	I am busy this weekend, but if you're in town, how about doing the nickel tour and Village Shopping the next weekend?
399	If not, maybe another time when you are available.
399	Let me know...
400	FYI, we are also going to send out a memo to Columbian counsel requesting advice on online trading and asking them for any other general update to their earlier advice.
401	Below is a confirm issue for handling.
401	Chris, in the future, please direct your confirmation requests to Susan Bailey, who is the current paralegal on the confirm rotation, or if the request is for an Annex B, to each of Susan Bailey, Susan Flynn and Marie Heard.
401	Thanks!
402	Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.
402	You have already authorized payment of the bill.
402	The fax requesting an update from Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.
402	What would you like to do?
403	Shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we asked for the update from them.
404	Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out.
405	Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob Bowen needed you to sign off on.
405	He says he never hear back.
405	Can you call him and give him the sign off.
405	Thanks!
406	Can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading with the following counterparties: Florida Power & Light Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company Dakota Gasification Company Enmax Corp. Much thanks!
407	Per my meetings with Credit and further research, I am making the following changes to the financial counterparty approval list.
407	Credit/Mark, let me know if you disagree with any of my changes.
407	List #1 1.
407	AES Power Inc.: no master in place, changing to "yes" , approved for financial trading 2.

407	Ormet Corporation: no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 8.
407	Swift Energy Company: no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading Bob, there are a few others I am still re-reviewing, I will get back to you as soon as I resolve/answer my questions.
408	How did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for Elf Trading S.A.
409	Another counterparty change, for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership.
409	We will switch that to a "yes" but only if they accept online GTC w/o change.
409	This is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for the partners, and that is totally unacceptable.
410	I discovered it was a non-ISDA master, so I had to delete the weather.
411	I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all financial trading.
411	She has also been discussing the utilities with outside counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.
411	She is going to bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully we'll have some more changes for you next week.
412	To remind me to discuss this with you when you get in: We received via our fax notices from the OMLX a request to provide them with information about our Y2K readiness.
412	When you have a minute let's look at the form together.
412	Probably Alan will have the answers.
413	I stopped by to see you because Mark got in the mail a blacklined draft of the prospectus from Bowne on the weather offering and I wanted to see if you got your own copy or do you need me to have one made for you.
414	Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project I have been working on.
414	The press releases went out last week.
414	Mark Taylor was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.
414	You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based commodity trading system.
414	You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.
414	Mark has been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of work for him.
414	Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether we should approve them for online trading.
414	As you can imagine, that has meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and trading restrictions.
414	As far as my "Fishkin" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, objectives, etc. We've found a few new software programs we've been looking at, some we found out Enron already has.
414	Mark and I are discussing what we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our thoughts soon.
414	Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design the software.
414	This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA opinions and the like.
414	We need that up and going desperately.
414	We, have been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put this database together and start loading the information.
414	So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!
414	P.S.
414	Thanks for the article!
415	Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.
415	If you are using that form at all you should update it to include our changes.
415	I think Paul mentioned in his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the basis form for Norway.
415	Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at that form.
415	See, you're always in my thoughts!
415	Missed you at the seminar.
415	I hope we'll see you at one of these soon!
416	I hear you had dinner with our friend Molly Saturday night, what happened to the relatives?!
417	When you have a minute, PECO called with an authorized trader list problem and Liz asked me to bring it to you for handling...
418	Angeline Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark Frevert?
418	I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.
418	How do you plan on doing this?
418	Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the signing.
418	What are your thoughts?
419	I will send a copy to you!
419	We miss you...
420	I called Edmund Cooper and he is out on vacation til Monday.
420	Do you think I should email him the certificate, have him print it out there in London, I guess Anita has to initial the two ISDA Master Agreements for signature, then Edmund could get them initialled by Credit in London, and then bring the certificates and agreements up to Mark Frevert for signature.
420	What do you think?
421	If you've got the copies, why don't you save them as a form into your system and use them to draft the Caltex Certificates.
421	Send them over to Edmund with the ISDA Master Agreements.
421	Leave him a message asking him if he could help you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed, then have him send the certificates to me for Kate's signature.
421	I think that should do it.
422	Thanks for your email.
422	It is important on a going forward basis that if we veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.
422	In response to your email I have the following comments: 1.
422	The New York Times Company: cannot trade derivatives online at all.
422	Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.
422	They cannot trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.
422	All their trades must be done by telephone.
422	2.
422	San Diego Gas & Electric Company: the California PUC said that utilities such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!
422	3.
422	Aspect Resources: can enter into derivative transactions.
422	We want the transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and Aspect.
422	4.
422	Brant-Allen Industries: Is shut down, more or less, for all financial trading.
422	They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading in general.
422	The board resolution they provided with the signed master agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.
422	5.
422	Cox & Perkins: We had a master with this counterparty and they have informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.
422	In reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the master if possible.
422	Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.
422	6.
422	Sonoco Products: We should not be trading with them at all until we resolve this payment dispute.
422	Sara Shackleton was working on that.
422	We do have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master.
423	Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest counterparty list: 1.
423	CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only 2.
423	Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
423	3.
423	Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved 4.
423	Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.
423	What happened?
423	5.
423	Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA Master Agreement this week 6.
423	UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be restricted for all other products 7.
423	Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement in this week 8.
423	Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather 10.
423	Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD weather swap is ok 11.
423	Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not a utility.
423	Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the regulatory people.
423	I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.
424	Per my conversations with Credit, the referenced counterparty is the New Jersey incorporated sub of a German company, a liquids based counterparty, and they are an eligible swap participant.
424	We do not have a master agreement in place with them.
424	I am approving them for all financial trading.
425	Per Peter's request...
426	I have received the Unanimous Written Consent of the Board of Directors of Enron North America Corp. dated 11/10/99 appointing Dale Neuner and Robert Shults as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of the Company for online trading.
426	The original Consent will be sent to Kate Cole for inclusion in the corporate minute book and copies will be sent to Dale and Bob.
426	When signing the Password Applications, Dale and Bob should sign them as "Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".
426	In the absence of Dale or Bob, any V.P.
426	or above can sign Password Applications (with initials from Legal).
426	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
427	Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion.
428	Can you forward to Karen a copy of the lastest Electronic Trading Agreement.
428	I'm not comfortable that what I have is the latest.
428	Much thanks!
429	In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap Agreement Database.
429	Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the information.
429	This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, Portland and Buenos Aires offices.
429	The only information we need to continue to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client privilege issues).
429	Access to this information would continue to be limited to Legal and Credit In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and Credit have access to the Portland General masters.
429	Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues.
429	Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to have this information and access available by that time.
429	In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.
429	Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the changes.
429	Thanks for your help!
430	How about Wednesday at 10:00 am?
431	Please find attached Annex B.doc.
432	Barry Tycholiz has asked me to confirm for you that we do have a master in place with Husky.
432	We do, indeed, and I will shoot a copy down to you.
433	I faxed over some changes Thursday.
433	I deleted all references to ECT and ECT Legal Advisors being a party to the opinion.
433	Haedicke is an officer of ECT International, he is General Counsel and Managing Director, and so he can sign as such.
433	No need to pull ECT into the opinion when unnecessary.
434	Mark wanted me to let you know he is reviewing your legal opinion and will call you with his comments.
435	What is this email about?
435	Do I need to do anything?
435	Also, your attachment is unreadable because the columns are overlapping.
436	I was told this was supposed to be an Omnibus, not a Deemed ISDA.
437	I checked our records and we do not have any Master Swap Agreement with either K&N Marketing or Kinder Morgan.
437	Perhaps Credit knows something about this.
437	In addition, we cannot approve any merger documents until we get copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant Secretary of State.
437	Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us.
438	Pam, Per the email below, we will be terminating the transactions referenced below today.
438	Can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #1 below so I can make sure I have referenced them correctly.
438	Much thanks!
439	Attached is the proposed form of Termination Agreement.
439	I have requested copies of the relevant confirmations from the Confirm Desk to confirm that the transactions are referenced correctly.
439	Please let me know if you have any comments.
440	Mark Taylor asked if we could make one additional change to the database.
440	He wants to move the "Restrictions" right after the counterparty name so it's the first thing the dealmakers see when the open an entry.
440	Thanks, we really appreciate your help!
441	Please find attached form of Deemed ISDA.
441	When you fax it to the counterparty can you please attach to the back of the fax IRS Forms 1001 and W-8.
441	Much thanks!
442	Mark asked if you could add something else.
442	Could you add an additonal drop down that follows "Legal Contacts that says "Historical Contacts". We wouldn't want anyone else to see that but Legal and Credit. Thanks!
443	Peter, Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.
443	Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we have in our form, so we're changing our form.
443	You are the man!
443	I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok there.
443	I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving holidays.
443	If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to be reachable. Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, Taffy will have the number).
443	Let me know if I can be of further help today!
444	If you need to get hold of us next week, Mark and my cell phone numbers are as follows: Mark: 011 44 7881 512 535 (dial like you were calling London)
445	We seem to be getting alot of questions about the name changes of the various Enserch/TXU entities, so attached is a comprehensive list.
445	A copy of the notice will be sent to the usual suspects.
446	Miss Tana Jones Houston, Texas 77005
447	Can you please give Sara the NYMEX numbers to review while Mark and I are out.
447	Thanks!
448	Peter, Is there anything I need to do on this project?
449	I am in room EB3802.
449	EB3890 was my old office.
450	Thanks for the article.
450	I will distribute it to our group and Credit.
450	With Online Trading quieting down a bit, Mark and I are finally focusing on "Project Fishkin" (as we call it).
450	I am already getting a new database developed, the jurisdictional database, to keep track of swap laws around the world.
450	We hope to finalize our recommendations soon, and get the project up to Haedicke for his approval.
450	Of course, Online trading goes live today to our customers, so there's not telling what problems may crop up.
450	I'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day!
450	Hope your holidays went well.
450	My mom came down from New York, and it was colder in Houston than it was at home!
451	If you have a complete list regarding the Enserch entities we wish to trade with, I can run it by Enserch and check on the legal names.
451	I think it would be helpful for our full distribution (Legal, Confirm and Others (settlements, Global Contracts, misc), if you would distribute a full list of the Enserch entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each entity. I think this will stop people coming back and asking again and again.
452	Frank, Mark asked me to handle this.
452	Can you forward to me the name and phone number of the person that signed the password application?
452	Thanks.
453	Peter, I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement.
453	It is an ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of June 28, 1995.
453	The Agreement was executed between ECT and Banque Paribas.
453	Banque Paribas changed its name to "Paribas" on May 11, 1998, so I think you need to change the agreement and signature line to read "Paribas, formerly known as Banque Paribas".
453	or something to that effect.
453	The agreement is governed by New York law.
454	Pam, Peter Keohane, our Calgary attorney, is working on a termination of some trades between ECT and Paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following confirmations ASAP, Deal nos.
454	EA7484.3 and EB3772.3.
454	Thanks yet again!
455	From what we have been able to determine, it appears that the City of Riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives.
456	Joe, I just found out Pam is out today and Peter needs these confirms ASAP.
456	Can you get them to him.
456	Thanks.
457	Thanks for your prompt help with this!
457	I know Peter appreciates it.
458	I asked Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.
458	I think in his job in Fuel and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.
458	He probably makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.
458	He also wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.
458	I spoke to Liz Sager and she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.
458	As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.
458	I spoke to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.
458	Of course, the only groups that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.
458	But we are going to open everything but the comments and "priority" screens to any interested business people.
458	I'm going to move the "restrictions" bar right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they will see will be any restrictions.
458	Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and can't remember things!).
459	I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with them.
459	I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical power trade with them.
459	Of course, we can still not do financial trading until we run through all the hoops with them.
459	I don't know who you directed your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading and I said we would send him a packet.
459	Richard Ramirez Fuel and Energy Risk Management Lower Colorado River Authority 3701 Lake Austin Boulevard Austin, Texas 78703 Thanks!
460	We have resolved the authority issue with referenced counterparty, and have approved all financial trading, including online financial trading, under the executed ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and this counterparty dated June
461	In response to your email re: Richardson Products II, this counterparty was approved for trading (without a master then in place) under my initial list of approved counterparties.
461	Per the email below, we then received in the signed master and the distribution was notified.
462	Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.
462	When I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a different path.
462	Something that yall will find helpful...
462	I've been working with the Lotus Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.
462	I am adding drop downs for "approved for online trading", so you will be able to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.
462	I think other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in terms of the financial contacts.
462	I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.
462	I hope this is helpful!
463	In response to your email, an amendment to the referenced executed ISDA Master was sent by Susan Bailey to the Counterparty on 11/23/99.
463	With respect to the credit, this amendment provides for an increase in the Counterparty Exposure Threshold from U.S. $3,000,000 to U.S. $5,000,000, and amends one of the MAC provisions for Counterparty by increasing Counterparty's Net Worth from CAD$85,000,000 to CAD$150,000,000.
463	Certain other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the the LC provisions, as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate our recent form changes.
463	THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED.
463	Other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 3rd party debt default for Counterparty of CAD$5,000,000 and U.S. $50,000,000 with respect to Enron Corp., an Exposure Threshold for ECT Canada of $10,000,000, and a MAC for ECT Canada tied to a drop in Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating below "BBB-" from S&P.
463	The other MAC for Counterparty that is not being changed is if Counterparty's ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 1 to 1.
463	I hope that helps...let me know if you need more info or if you need me to fax these documents to you.
464	1.
464	Vitol S.A., Inc. - already approved for financial trading this morning, master in place.
464	2.
464	Nicor Enerchange-approved for financial trading, no master in place.
464	3.
464	Helmerich & Payme Energy Services, Inc.-approved for financial trading, no master in place.
464	4.
464	Ashland Speciality Chemical Company-is a division of Ashland, Inc. Ashland, Inc. is approved for financial trading, no master in place.
464	CONFIRM DESK: WHEN THESE CONFIRMS GO OUT, we consider this counterparty to be Ashland, Inc. We want Ashland, Inc. to show up as the company name and on the signature line.
464	If the counterparty wants the division name there, we can sign it "Ashland, Inc., acting through its Ashland Speciality Chemical Company division", but we want the company name there and on the hook.
464	Let me know if you have any questions...
465	Just a note to remind you about something we need to discuss tomorrow, Transco Zone 6.
466	Why don't you send them directly to Kate, with a note to return them to you.
466	It might speed things up.
467	Aquila wants to trade online under two names, Aquila Risk Management and Aquila Energy Marketing.
467	They have asked us to attach to their ETA, a listing, and copies, of all master agreements we have in place with those two counterparties, whether physical, financial, gas, power, etc. Can you look those up for us and copy the relevant contracts?
467	Thanks for your help!
468	Attached is my response to your 12/1/99 list.
469	Molly, Why were the counterparties on your latest list under the Legal tab different from those under the Credit tab?
470	The counterparties below for review are under the Credit approval tab.
470	Please let me know ASAP if they are approved to trade.
471	Attached is another list for approval.
471	Under the comments section, if it says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing.
472	If you open in "view" you will be able to see it.
472	Thanks for your prompt response!
473	You get a gold star for the week!
474	That seems reasonable to me!
474	Ask the Swap Paralegals, no matter what the problem is, my answer is "well, you know what that means..."
474	and they all respond "we can go home!".
474	If they only made me boss...
475	In connection with Enron Online, please add the following people to your email distribution list for new contracts or any contract or counterparty change: Karen Lambert, Frank Davis, and Carrie Southard.
476	Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
476	Obviously, we need to still input the trades.
476	Peter, It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC meetings on Thursday.
476	I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be in.
477	I forget my attachments all the time.
477	Sorry!
478	Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 12/3.
478	All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be ignored.
478	If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to look at it.
478	If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going forward basis.
478	Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.
478	We rarely expect counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.
478	I ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.
478	Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.
478	Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them.
479	What is was is that the document was in Word 95 and we work in Word 97, so I just had to go in and open Word 95.
479	I think what you are doing is what they are trying to get up and going here in Houston, but they're not ready yet.
479	Mine and Mark's questions to you is who goes down the Legal List and says yes or no to trading?
480	Attached are the final lists for this week for your approval.
480	Again, if I do not hear from the respective physical trading groups in 1 day I will assume that all counterparties are approved.
481	Another list!
482	Are you approving this for financial trading?
482	Per our conversations last week, I thought it would not meet the eligible swap participant criteria.
482	Let me know....
483	Any word back of City of Riverside?
484	Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis...
484	unless I specifically mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for all the products that Credit has approved them for.
484	If I have an exception, it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.
484	Most of the comments I will have relate to financial counterparties: For Financial I am not responding to Credits "declined" counterparties.
484	1.
484	AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company Ltd. BAD NAME.
484	There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta Energy Company Ltd. I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty if the Confirms go out under that name.
484	2.
484	Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc. We are currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.
484	We earlier sent out a draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to change the name to Ashland, Inc. So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. name, I can approve it for financial trading.
484	3.
484	Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.
484	I have already approved trading under Bayer Corporation.
484	4.
484	Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P. 5.
484	Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy Company.
484	We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, which I will approve for financial trading under that name.
484	6.
484	Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved trading under TMV Corp. 7.
484	Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.
484	I already approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.
484	FIX NAME!
484	For Power 1.
484	City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter.
485	Thanks for your prompt reply!
486	What a happy coincidence about the book!
486	We'll have to share thoughts when we're done reading it.
486	The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.
486	I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.
486	He's having to work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were covered in my class.
486	I told him if you two were paying more attention instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with a ruler up in Canada!
486	Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you...
487	I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with us.
487	He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa Browning at (403) 543-7188.
487	I told him I would pass on the request to our Credit team.
487	Much thanks!
488	Mr. Harrell, Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.
488	When we had a big group meeting a few months ago we (Legal) were actually surprised by our success level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.
488	Since you congratulated Credit, I took it upon myself to also email the message to Credit.
488	too..
489	FYI...
490	I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced counterparty right now.
490	NCPA would like to get a password in place today to start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of transactions they can do online.
490	Per my earlier approval, this counterparty can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by Credit.
490	They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading financial).
490	Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message is conveyed to her.
490	If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP!
491	Karen, I don't know that I need to get these lists from you that reference the contract numbers.
491	I really don't know anything relative to contracts numbers.
491	What was helpful was your memo earlier that listed the rejected masters.
491	I took at look at it and then distributed it to the Legal EOL team.
491	Thanks!
492	Can you take a look at this and let me know what you think...
493	Per my conversation with Frank, we are opening up the referenced counterparty to trade financial under the division name indicated above.
494	Here is a rough first draft of our jurisdictional database (summary of swap laws).
494	Besides the obvious typos, how does this work for you?
495	Thank you for such a prompt turnaround!
495	I have forward your email to our swap lawyers for their input and hope to get back to you shortly.
496	Canadian Securities Acts.
496	(i) Each Transaction shall constitute an &OTCDerivative8 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securities Act (British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it ia &Qualified Party8 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta SeCommission Order Doc#394043 and paragraph 1.1 of the draft British ColumbiaSecurities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501, as in effect on the date hereof.]
497	Bob, In order to be able to draft the Aquila assignments below, I am going to need the contract list which shows the contracts the trades were originally under and which contract they will be under when we assign them.
497	Can you for that list to me ASAP so I can get started drafting the assignments.
497	It make take some time.
497	Thanks!
498	Attached is the referenced counterparty list.
498	There is no change to either counterparty since my earlier response to you.
499	The financial agreement is with Petro-Canada.
499	We don't appear to have received any notice to the contrary.
500	Peter, I don't know what letter you're talking about...
501	With respect to the attached list, please note that for Credit's "amended" counterparties, there will be no change in our original approvals except as noted.
501	Also, I have not responded to the "declined" counterparties, so those noted as such are not approved for any products (I didn't want to go through and "X" out all the boxes).
502	Attached is our standard assignment form for financial masters, and a very rough draft of Aquila...
503	Kate Cole's office sent me down your executed certificates, and I am going to Fedex them over to you.
503	Have a nice holiday!
504	Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.
504	Per my conv.
504	w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power products, and vice versa.
504	I don't know how you want to handle that, I have not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.
504	What should we do on a going forward basis?
505	Russell, On Public Service Company of Colorado, I don't know why you have this on "no financial trades", but if it was because of the contract authority problem, that has been resolved, so you could open it up if that is the reason.
505	See Lotus Notes for more detail.
506	Attached please find referenced list.
506	Per my earlier emails, I am not "xing" out the boxes for european power, but they should not be traded.
507	I have received the fully executed amendment to the ETA for the referenced counterparty dated 12/20/99.
507	Copies will be distributed as usual to Frank Davis, with a copy to Dave Forster.
508	I have received the fully executed Termination Agreement dated as December 15, 1999, effective as of December 17, 1999, terminating certain transactions under the ISDA Master Agreement.
508	The ISDA Master Agreement remains in full force and effect.
508	Copies will be distributed.
509	Please change the approval for the referenced counterparty to add basis swaps as an approved financial products.
510	Attached are the referenced lists.
510	If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep the Legal approvals the same).
510	The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list.
510	For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European based physical power products.
511	Well, I got your new website added as a shortcut in my mail directory, so now I can bother you at will!
511	Watch what you pray for, you just might get it!
511	We had a rather uninspiring flight back from New York, Craig watched "Inspector Gadget" on the inflight movie(he said it was really bad) and Danelia read the Bible the whole way.
511	The only good news is we arrive 1/2 hour early!
511	The weather was so warm in Houston that we had to turn the air on in the car.
511	It cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters.
511	When I got home I spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where I moved them for the freeze that never arrived.
511	That's one thing I hate about Houston winters, you can never count on it staying cold so I have to keep moving the plants in and out.
511	After that, I aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter box.
511	Then I ordered in Chinese and read three days of newspapers.
511	Very relaxing!
511	Don't I have an exciting life?
511	Keep in touch...
512	I tried ridggway@concentric.net and it didn't work.
512	Is there some type there?
513	We have received the signed faxed copy of the Letter Agreement dated 12/28/99 amending the ETA for the referenced counterparty.
513	Copies will be distributed.
514	I've had no list come throught with this counterparty.
514	What's the scoop?
514	Will it be on tomorrow's list?
515	Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.
515	Per earlier emails, no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear otherwise.
515	Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was already approved yesterday to do basis financial.
515	All other prior approvals for that counterparty should stay the same.
516	Anita, It has been a pleasure working with you and I hope to find you in my life later on down the road.
516	Best wishes being a full time mommy.
516	I looked at the baby pictures on the website and they were adorable!
517	Is this showing up on today's list?
518	Thanks for your email.
518	I've got everything I need now.
519	Attached is referenced list.
519	Again, no European power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
520	I will attend.
520	Let me know what I need to bring.
520	Thanks for your messages...
521	I have received the following originally executed documents from the referenced counterparty: 1.
521	EOL Customer Registration Form 2.
521	Password Application 3.
521	Amendment to ETA These copies will be walked down to you.
522	Will you be at the same dinner?
522	How goes the house?
523	I have received the originally executed Amendments dated 12/20/99 to the Electronic Trading Agreements for each of American Electric Power Service Corporation and AEP Energy Services, Inc. Copies will be distributed.
524	It would be nice if you could be at my dinner, since I probably won't know anyone else.
524	Anytime you want to go to lunch to check on the house status, I'd be glad to go...
525	Julie Gomez, that's who it was!
526	Lunch sounds good!
527	We have received the executed Amendment to the ETA for the referenced counterparty dated 01/05/00.
527	Copies will be distributed.
528	OK with me!
529	We are closing to finalizing a Lotus Notes Database for us to keep track of approvals for online trading counterparties and any amendments to online trading documents.
529	Once the database is done, I (and you, I guess) will have to input the data for the Houston and London based Credit counterparties.
529	I am forward to you this early draft of the database for you to see what it looks like.
529	You will have to go into "create new counterparty" to see the format once you opened the database up.
529	We're still revising it to add a drop down for amendments to online trading documents, and then we're going to have a sort similar to the Pending Swap Update sort on Lotus Notes, that will show the Counterparty Name, Approved for Online Trading: Yes or No, and then follow with any amendments to the online agreements.
529	This will, obviously, help us keep track of if and why we've approved a counterparty, and also help us generate reports to the online trading team.
529	Access will currently be granted to the same people who have access to the Master Swap Agreement Database.
529	If you have any additional Credit Online People to add let me know.
529	We hope to have it ready within the week so we can start populating it with the information.
530	can you add the regularly scheduled Legal/Credit Meetings, and the Swap Group Meeting for my calendar for the year.
530	Thanks!
531	How goes figuring out why our positions were so far off?
532	With respect to your email below, I am already working with Bob Bowen on assigning the various Aquila trades.
532	On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc. If you get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.
532	Once I get that I can prepare the assignment.
532	I will also need the name and phone number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.
532	I don't know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?
532	Once I get all this I can prepare that assignment.
533	I don't know what you mean about the positions being "defunct"?
534	We have no idea!
534	We rely on you to tell us what the positions are!
535	Without calling each of the respective traders, we do not know any of the positions.
536	Attached are referenced lists.
536	Again, no approvals for European physical power products until further notice.
537	How does one decide what recipe to cook?
538	Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves, we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather under the EOL GTC's.
539	As a further to my previous email, the EOL Group will code the weather transactions to fall under the financial master, and the Confirmation Desk should confirm the weather trades under the current form of confirmation.
540	Attached is referenced list.
540	Continuing being boring, no european power until further notice...
541	Our only concerns are that we have the appropriate tax forms signed and in-house before they start trading.
541	If they trade U.S. products from the UK we will have to get the appropriate U.S. tax forms in, and Edmund can address any UK tax forms they might need on UK products traded from the UK.
542	Please change your records to relect that Legal has agreed to open the referenced counterparty to trade any financial products.
543	For a Netherlands incorporated counterparty wanting to do a weather option transaction, on the list you sent me earlier for the approved products for european countries, you had no options or swaptions for commodity derivatives, but nothing on weather.
543	What's the scoop on weather options?
544	Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for weather transactions.
544	The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an ISDA Local Currency.
544	The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way back then.
544	Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online trading.
544	Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other currency other than U.S. $$.
544	If either of those issues come up, let me know.
545	Attached are the referenced list.
545	Again, no european physical power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
546	Per the request of Lucy Ortiz, I have reviewed the current list of weather counterparties we are trading with, and have targeted four counterparties that we have open for trading weather offline that I am now going to open for online trading.
546	1.
546	El Paso Energy Marketing Marketing Company, name change as of 12/1/99 to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company - previously approved for all products, except weather, now add approved for weather also.
546	Non-ISDA Master Agreement in place.
546	2.
546	Madison Gas and Electric Company - previously not approved for any financial products, now approving for all financial products.
546	No Master Agreement in place.
546	Credit, we need to pursue this financial master.
546	3.
546	Swiss Re Financial Products Corp. - we previously did not approve this counterparty for any financial trading - now open for weather financial trading only.
546	No Master Agreement currently in place; however, we are getting close on the negotiation of this ISDA Master.
546	4.
546	Vitol N.A. - we previously had them approved for all products, but weather, open them up for weather, as well.
546	Non-ISDA Master Agreement in place.
546	Steve Douglas, counterparty is a Swiss corporation and have never sent us their tax forms.
547	Why don't you fax that letter up to me so I can figure out what it is,
548	Stacy, I don't know anything about this, I guess it's yours?
549	We have received a faxed copy of the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated January 11, 2000.
549	The original will follow by Fedex.
549	Copies will be distributed.
550	I'll be there...
551	Please find attached list.
552	In response to a RUSH request from Frank: FINANCIAL TRADING: El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. is approved to trade all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement dated as of 04/20/95.
552	Such Master Agreement and the Transactions thereunder we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of Agreements dated as of 12/1/99.
552	Confirmation Desk: with respect to weather confirmations, they should continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing Company weather trades (changing the name, of course).
552	We are in the process of replacing the old "ERMS Style" Master Agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement and will notify you when the new agreement is executed.
552	PHYSICAL TRADING: Approved for all products.
552	Global Contracts: talk to Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC).
552	EMERGING PRODUCTS.
552	Approved for all products.
552	POWER: Not approved for trading.
552	All power trading should continue under the old El Paso Power Services Company entity until we receive documentation that evidences the approval of the assignment of their power license.
553	We have received the executed Amendment executed as of 01/11/0, to the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated as of July 13, 1994, This Amendment adds FX and Currency Option provisions.
553	Copies will be distributed.
554	Below are the training preferences for our three Houston traders.
554	If you could sign them up I'd appreciate it .
554	I'll let you know as soon as I hear from the two Portland lads.
554	Thanks for your help, it was fun chatting with you!
555	Attached is the referenced list.
555	Again, no physical European power approval for US counterparty until further notice.
555	The El Paso Merchang Energy-Gas, L.P. was responded to by email already yesterday.
556	How goes you choosing a date for NYMEX ACCESS training?
556	I faxed you the schedule.
556	The Houston guys are going February 4, from 10:00 - 2:00.
556	The earlier you reserve, the better chance you have of getting the date you want...
557	We have received the originally executed Password Application and Amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement dated as of 1/5/00.
557	The originals are being walked down to you.
558	Attached please find the referenced list.
558	Some additional comments are as follows: 1.
558	City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals.
558	2.
558	Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).
558	It can only trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.
558	As usual, no European power until further notice.
559	Attached is revised list, opening up EOG Resources, and shutting down Cajun Electric Power Cooperative.
559	Thanks for the catch!
560	I don't know where we stand on reviewing the derivatives situation for the referenced counterparty, but Frank Davis with EOL just called and the counterparty is applying for a password, so he wanted to refresh his memory why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.
560	I told him that we were just looking at their situation last week, and to give your name & # to the counterparty if they question why they can't trades derivatives.
560	It isn't clear to me that we're ready to change our opinion on them yet.
561	We have received the originally executed Termination Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999, effective as of December 3, 1999 terminating certain transactions under the ISDA Master Agreement.
561	Copies will be distributed
562	Our two Portland traders also want to attend the same seminar as the Houston guys below.
562	Can you confirm that these reservations are OK so our two Portland traders can make plane reservations.
562	Much thanks!
563	I can't believe you are approving this!
563	I was just about to give you a call to ask you about the status.
563	What a coincidence!
564	Attached please find referenced list.
564	No european power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
565	Just in case you want to join us, Mark, Liz Sager, Shawna and I are going to sign up for the Guadelupe River rafting tour.
565	If that's your cup of tea join us, 'cause it should be fun!
566	Can you please shut this counterparty down from trading weather.
566	Thanks!
567	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching my list of North America "utility" counterparties.
567	My given task when I compiled this list was to identify "utilities" and determine if there was a reason we should not approve online trading for the counterparty.
567	We originally denied approval for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding commercial reason to transact.
567	We are now taking the position that investor owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for trading.
567	However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties identified as such do not need to be included in your review.
567	Obviously, if you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us know.
567	In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian counterparties.
567	We will run those by Canadian counsel.
567	Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.
567	You may ignore the "Approved for Trading" column.
567	For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could not locate information from any of the other sources.
567	Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly.
568	We received a Notice from the NYMEX today that they have set March 2 as the date for power to go ex-pit.
568	I will send each of you a copy of the memo.
568	Copies are also being immediately hand delivered to Jim Fallon and Tim
569	Attached please find referenced list, Again, no physical power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
570	Why won't they let you go to the Corp. conference?
570	It's too bad, this new resort across the was from the Hyatt Hill Country where we stayed that last time it supposed to be even nicer.
570	Bummer!
570	It appears the ECT one is probably always going to be at the Woodlands Resort, which is real boring...
571	FYI
572	Can whoever is working on the revised confirms for the referenced counterparty let Doug know the status?
572	Thanks!
573	When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have fixes/upgrades we need to the database.
573	In particular, the EOL people are about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.
573	When you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that sort working.
573	Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we need to make.
573	Much thanks!
574	Attached please find referenced list.
574	No european power products approved until further notice.
575	Below are the people I would like to have access to this database: Me Mark Taylor Leslie Hansen Elizabeth Sager Alan Aronowitz Harry Collins Stacy Dickson Jeff Hodge David Portz Molly Harris Tom Moran Edmund Cooper in London Justin Boyd in London Thanks!
576	Why did you send this credit worksheet to me for a physical deal?
577	Attached please find the referenced list.
577	Of course, no European power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
578	Am I supposed to do anything with this new counterparty, or wait until you add it to tomorrow's list?
579	San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade financial.
579	Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed to trade financial?!).
579	Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial?
580	Do any of the other trading groups have any masters in place with Transammonia, Inc. or any of its divisions, such as Trammochem, Trammo Gas or TrammoGas & Petrochemicals?
580	Can you let me know ASAP.
580	Thanks!
581	I am meeting with the exterminator tomorrow a.m. He said he would arrive between 8-9 am, if he shows up more toward 9 I might not be back yet, if he shows up more towards 8, 10:00 will probably be fine.
582	Attached is the list for 1/24/00.
582	For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group.
582	I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.
582	This Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL.
583	Attached is the referenced list.
583	Again, no european power products for US counterparties until further notice.
583	Also, Renaissance is an Amended approval, so I just wrote in the corner-amended-no change, since I have no change in the earlier approvals I told you.
584	Don't feel left out, but you're the only person I haven't heard from...
585	I said that Contract Administration couldn't determine by looking at the database whether there was one and you said you would look at the database, that you might be able to tell.
586	We have received the executed Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated January 13, 2000.
586	This Amendment amends the Threshold levels in the Credit Support Annex.
586	Copies will be distributed.
587	We have no record of such an ISDA Master or any other financial master being in place with this counterparty.
587	Could it be drugs?!!
588	I hope you know I was joking with you...I was a little hesitant about sending that message...
589	I'm glad to hear from you!
589	I guess I'm a little confused.
589	I thought you were going to send me your form.
589	I would be happy to send ours.
589	I can draft one up in a jiffy.
589	Just let me know what you prefer.
589	P.S.
589	Isn't email wonderful!
590	The Lower Colorado River Authority has called and is ready to do financial business with us and wants to get a revised draft of the ISDA.
590	The credit on the draft I sent them before is quite old, so I need someone to get me new credit or tell me if the old credit is still ok.
590	Respectfully,
591	We are going to open San Diego Gas & Electric to transact the following financial products, but are going to limit the length of the trades to 3 months or less.
591	The approved products per the Master Agreement are any "swap, cap, floor, collar or option...based on the prices of crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or electric power...".
591	I have previously not distributed the executed Master Agreement because of unresolved issues with the counterparty, but will send copies today to the usual distribution.
591	We have an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in place between ECT and the counterparty dated as of February 25, 1997.
591	All financial trades for this counterparty should go under the master.
592	FINANCIAL: We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc., acting through its division Trammochem.
592	That master has since been expanded to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division.
592	All trades and confirms can be done as follows: Transammonia, Inc. Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the confirm.
592	PHYSICAL: My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master in place.
593	Mark just had to run down quick to a meeting.
593	When he gets out we'll give you a call & go over this stuff.
593	We really appreciate your help!
594	If you are in Houston on Feb 10 and HAVE NOT PLANNED ON HAVING DINNER WITH ME, then just don't plan on coming.
594	I mean, after your last lame excuse about that hotel by the airport, I'm gonna take it real personal if the only hotel room you can get this time is in Pearland.
594	Ya know what I mean...
594	Anyway, I have been thinking about you and wondering what you're up to.
594	For the Enron Corp. Legal Conference, real cool people (like me) are signing up for the raft trip, so as long as the weather's nice we're going to be floating down the Guadalupe drinking some brews.
594	So if you were cool you'd be hanging out with the cool group (like me)...what are your plans?!!
595	Attached please find referenced list.
595	Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice.
596	Please be advised that the NYMEX ACCESS training session will be held from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm at the DoubleTree Hotel in the Allen Center.
597	Usually y'all let me know who's working on the Credit and when I can expect some, but since I didn't hear back I thought that y'all just forgot about me since I'm not on the day to day stuff...there is no particular urgency, next week is fine...
598	Per your request, attached is our sample ISDA Schedule for a plain U.S. corporate entity.
599	I feel better already...sniff...sniff...
600	Attached please find referenced list.
600	As usual, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
601	I just got some late changes in from Leslie, so please hold list I JUST send you until she resolves these issues.
601	Thanks!
602	Here is my revised list incorporating Leslie Hansen's power comments.
603	Attached please find referenced list.
603	The only amended counterparty with a change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.
603	I wonder, when we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?
603	Right now I have to go find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see if I have any problem with the change.
603	So usually, unless I have - change next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.
603	Does that make sens?
604	I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall "system" still needs to be designed.
604	I've been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database.
604	We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process.
604	Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees.
604	I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.
604	First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country.
604	Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going.
604	I've actually got the database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon.
604	Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been online trading.
604	I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information.
604	With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.
604	We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.
604	The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal advice, etc. This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, power, etc).
604	I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours.
604	The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them.
604	So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.
604	Among other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.
604	I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept.
604	I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world.
604	So the setup for this might go quickly, although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem.
604	The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases.
604	So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system.
604	Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.
605	It's a date!
605	Would you like me to make reservations at someplace nice, or just go casual?
606	FYI, Today is the date for renewal of the Consent of Service of Process in connection with the ISDA Master Agreement in place with the referenced counterparty.
606	I have faxed Mr. Blaquier a request to provide me with evidence of such renewal.
606	I will keep you apprised.
607	My fax won't go through, I appear to have a bad number.
607	Can one of you provide me with a new fax & phone numbe ror contact Mr. Blaquier.
607	Thanks!
608	Debra is the paralegal for the physical gas trading group.
609	The fax still can't seem to go through.
609	Do I have too mane 2's in the fax #?
609	Do I need to add a 1 to dial out of the U.S.?
610	This came up at our Group meeting today, did you ever sign that Master Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end?
611	new person taking over for Bob Shults
612	Attached please find referenced lists.
612	Again, now European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
613	Bob Klein from Salomon Smith Barney would like to arrange a conf.
613	call tomorrow at 11:00 am.
613	I checked your calendar and you look clear so I told him that was OK and that we would call him.
614	I have been faxed a proposed form of assignment from El Paso with respect to certain trades transacted between 1/14 and 1/25 which they would like assigned to their affiliate, El Paso Energy Marketing Canada Inc. I am having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as to whether we should consent to this assignment.
615	I have had to revise the list I provided to you earlier.
615	The change was shutting Kimball down for financial as well.
616	Shari, how do you want to handle this?
617	I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and hasn't heard from them.
617	I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.
617	He said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got some time to resolve this.
617	I'll keep you posted.
618	I do not appear to be having a winning record for getting my approval list right the first time today.
618	Attached is also a revised list for 01/31/00.
618	Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...
619	Can you make a note in Lotus Notes reflecting your conversation.
619	Thanks!
620	FYI, about the Canadian master netting agreements.
621	Attached please find referenced list.
621	Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
621	On Sithe Power where we only changed the counterparty id #, there is no change from my previous approval.
622	I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade under the "Master Master" for the referenced Counterparty.
622	It's not surprising, it's a confusing master!
622	This is currently the only agreement we have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial transactions in one agreement.
622	There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between ECT and AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).
622	This agreement provides for financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.
622	It does not provide for any other physical products.
622	Call me if you have any questions...
623	Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.
623	I was not aware we were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to open up.
623	I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot trade.
623	So, I've go to start opening up my utilities...
624	Marie was just telling me about your rough tour of duty in the French Alps next week.
624	I speak a little high school French...perhaps you might need some assistance while you are there...?!
625	How do they override letters go out?
625	Do you tell someone, do I need to?
626	Can you please shut this counterparty down for weather.
626	Thanks!
627	Attached please find the referenced list.
627	On the amended counterparties, Southwestern Public Service Company is the only one with a change, with Enron sells power only, and on the only new counterparty, Minnesota Power, we've got Enron selling power only also.
627	Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.
628	I thought Bob's email was cute.
628	I asked him to get me our deals numbers for the El Paso assignment, and he sent me the following...
629	Marie and I had a giggle over your email!
630	Who's Dana?
631	Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web sites: www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records) www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, repair records) www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test results" they have some info on SUV crash tests. Since y'all don't have as many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident). Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety...
632	You narratives aren't too long, I'm just giving you some grief!
633	I have created a database for the Legal Dept., somewhat similar to how the master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals for EOL trading, as well as any executed amendments to the EOL Password Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.
633	I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit counterparties or not.
633	I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it for you.
633	Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you have an assistant do that.
633	Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very helpful).
633	It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty).
633	Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at it just to see what I'm doing.
633	We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not fully operational yet.
633	Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any changes, it'll screw things up...
634	Attached please find the referenced list.
634	As usual, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further ntocie.
635	Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated....!
636	Would you like to set up a time to chat?
636	My calendar is pretty clear this week, except for tomorrow at 2:00 pm.
637	We wish you the best for your vacation!
637	I hope the rest of the Credit Group maintains the high standard of diligence and promptness that you have established.
638	I haven't heard back from you about my EOL database.
638	I will hope that your lack of response means that you are busy, not in disapproval of my lovely database...
639	Attached please find the referenced lists.
639	We have no changes to the amended counterparties, so the only counterparty really with a comment is Westcoast Energy, which we have not approved for power.
639	Of course, no European power for US entities until further notice.
640	My Apartment: 1.
640	Fix leg on sunroom denim couch 2.
640	Fix front of dresser drawer in back bedroom that is falling off 3.
640	Front door - handle is loose 4.
640	The window in the back bedroom behind the bed is missing trim.
640	I think the trim is in the closet in the living room.
640	The blinds won't be right if we don't get that trim in. Downstairs Apartment: 1.
640	Fix broken window in front bedroom 2.
640	In bathroom, piece of wood has fallen off cabinet 3.
640	In bathroom, towel rack is broken.
640	Can you replace?
640	4.
640	Peter says ice cube maker won't shut water off when is on, so he just had it off 5.
640	Nancy said front door handle is loose 6.
640	Do we have any drips in sinks?
640	The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.
640	They are going to refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.
640	I would like to recarpet upstairs.
640	Where do you suggest I go to get new carpeting?
641	Two emails and still no response...was it something I said?!
642	Can you change it on my calendar.
642	Thanks!
643	Attached please find the referenced list.
643	Since all the counterparties are amended counterparties, my changes are as follows: 1.
643	Statoil - no change in earlier approvals 2.
643	Texla - I don't think it's a change, but they cannot trade US power, also there is no change for financial, I previously said and we continue not to trade financial.
643	3.
643	Avista Corporation- Washington Water Power Division.
643	For financial trading for Avista Corporation I previously said no financial trading.
643	I am going to open them up for all financial trading.
643	They can trade under the Avista Corporation name, or they can trade as Avista Corporation, acting through its Washington Water Power Division.
643	For power trading, they can trade all US West power products, but can Enron can only sell to Avista for US East power products.
643	Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice.
644	Just a reminder to talk to Tim Belden...
645	I have not heard back from DAPSA with respect to the Consent to Service of Process.
645	Can your business contact there give them a call?
645	Thanks.
646	Per my conversations with John Suttle in Credit, I am opening up the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products.
647	Just a reminder...to talk to Tim Belden....
648	Why do we have two active masters?!
648	Because it appears that Synder/Santa Fe merged and Susan B. did not handle to multiple master issue!
649	In looking through Lotus Notes for EOL, it appears we have two active masters for Santa Fe Snyder Corporation.
649	Does anyone know which one is the active master?
650	The master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the Trade Option Exemption.
650	Are we adding that into confirms?
651	When would you like to discuss utilities...?
652	I went through our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and determined that the following masters do not permit power: The Bakersfield Californian newprint only CGAS, Inc. natural gas only (are currently shut down for trading because authority certificate only covered one trade) Coastal Gas Marketing Company natural gas transactions only Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) no commodity transactions E.W. Scripps Company (The) 48.8 gram newsprint swaps only Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc. no commodity transactions.
652	Weather is ok Mellon Bank NA FX and currency option transactions only Midland Bank plc FX and currency option transactions only National Westminster Bank FX and currency option transactions only Palladium Insurance Limited weather only Phibro, Inc. energy price swaps based on fixed and floating prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products and/or call and put options based on the prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products Praxair, Inc. natural gas only PXRE Corporation weather only St. Paul Re (Bermuda) Ltd. weather only Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited weather only Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale FX and currency option transactions only
653	TAKE A VACATION DAY!
654	Please find attached the referenced list.
654	For Enserco Energy, Inc., my previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns are not in the same order anymore).
654	Then, the only other new counterparty is also shut down for power but open for everything else.
655	We need to amend the master on Williams, and Mark asked me to see you about it because this type of amendment might have to be made to a number of counterparty masters.
655	When you have some time, can I come around...Thanks...
656	I will attend.
657	I have received executed copies of the following assignments of certain EOL trades (physical and financial): 1.
657	Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Houston Pipe Line Company 2.
657	Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp. 3.
657	Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Canada Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp. Copies of these assignments will be sent to the usual distribution group.
658	The EOL trade assignment letters are prepared off the same form we do our regular assignments.
658	There is no special language in the assignment form about online issues.
659	Attached are the Swap Group's form of Enron Corp. and Counterparty guarantees.
659	Erica, these forms are located at atty.fms/swaps/current
660	I'm ready for a real challenge...!
660	It is always my pleasure to help you and Babs!
661	What the latest with Force?
661	Should we proceed with this amendment...
662	With this attitude, you are sure to work up in the standings of being our favorite Credit person...
663	The referenced counterparty is approved to trade all products except power.
664	I do believe you can look up who is working on this master in Lotus Notes...
665	Greg, check with Nella or Peter.
665	The ISDA 1994 Credit Support Annex should be contained in the binder I gave Peter during his secondment here in Houston.
666	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 15, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.
666	Copies will be distributed in the usual manner.
667	And you just know I just hate to be right...!
668	Attached please find the referenced lists.
668	Please note the following: 1.
668	For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power.
668	For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.
668	2.
668	For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP, but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.
668	Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties.
669	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 8, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
669	Copies will be distributed in the usual manner
670	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated January 25, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with respect to the referenced Counterparty.
670	Copies will be distributed in the usual manner.
671	Thanks for following up with this!
671	It is critical we have accurate information on our positions.
671	Continually busting our limits could subject the company to potentially substantial fines from the NYMEX.
671	Please let me know what Mike's thoughts are...
672	Oh, you little sweet talker...!
673	No, I didn't get it.
673	Just reply back to this email & reattach it.
674	Can we do a "See" dropdown like the Master Swap Agreement Database, so we can track name changes?
674	Thanks!
675	As a follow-up to our conversation, the referenced counterparty is not an eligible swap participant, therefore we need to shut them down for all financial.
676	What do you think about the situation below?
677	Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.
677	On Encal, the only amended counterparty, I don't know if this is a change or not from the prior approval, but Leslie shut them down for power.
677	All other prior approvals for that counterparty should remain the same.
678	Let me know what you think...I may go do my "long" run on Sunday, if you're doing one too, maybe we can meet for breakfast...
679	What are your thoughts on this...
680	Is this trade something you know something about?
681	I spoke to Mike Mulligan at Paribas and he said he had discussed this trade with Lee.
681	I don't know if you need any help from me expediting this amendment to the guaranty, let me know if you do.
681	Mike's number is in our Master Swap Agreement database.
682	Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments: 1.
682	BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.
682	We got the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all financial.
682	2.
682	Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.
682	That should be the name that goes out on the confirm.
682	All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power.
683	Attached is the Enron Employee Referral Form and resume of my friend Patty Young, which I will be submitting to two groups for consideration.
683	Please let me know if anything else is needed.
684	I don't understand what it is I haven't completed.
684	Can you let me know so I can complete the form.
684	Thanks!
685	What if there is no specific job.
685	I spoke to Mary Solmonson in Global Contracts and she said they had several job offerings and to send the resume to her and she would take a look at it and forward it to the relevant groups?
686	EOL needs to hear ASAP whether Nicor Gas Company is approved to trade online...can you let me know...thanks!
687	Attached is the referenced approval list.
688	Attached is the revised Referral Form and Resume for Patty Young.
688	I hope this does it!
689	Tonight I'm going to see a house after work today and then I have a late Sergei workout.
689	But keep me in mind in the future...
689	I finally got your application accepted by our personnel group, so now I can forward it to the respective groups for review.
689	One of the bad things about big corporations are the forms you have to fill out to do anything...
690	That was funny!
691	We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement (which supersedes and replaces the Master Agreement [ECT] executed 1/30/97, dated as of 10/19/95): Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: 10/19/95 Executed Date: 02/09/00 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: TXU Energy Trading Company Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX Confirm Desk: As previously noted, we have agreed to a special form of confirmation acceptance letter
692	FYI, attached is the Confirm Desk's latest list of confirms requiring special provisions.
693	At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, since it's not such a large amount of money.
693	Sara Shackleton is heading down there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to give you a head's up about our thinking on this.
694	Dear Mr. Zunic, Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our Master Agreement.
694	Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 if you have any comments or questions.
695	With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.
695	FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and should be treated as an amended counterparty.
696	Below is the new drop down I need added: Trade Option Representation (choose one only): standard weather included enron must be offeree none other Mike, the above should have a box to check, and the box should always check "standard" unless someone goes in and effectively changes it.
696	Then add the following: Other trading provisions pulp & paper Switching databases to the EnronOnline database: We need to add a category for a new product, Credit Derivatives, have a comment box just like financial or power, have it follow after power.
697	Attached please find the referenced list.
697	I haven't said it for a few lists, but remember, no European power for US counterparties until further notice...
698	Greg, It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no response from them.
698	We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July since our form has changed since then.
698	Once we get the go ahead from John Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested.
699	My pleasure...!
700	There are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on this list.
701	No, they never gave me an updated copy.
702	Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States Power Companies.
702	We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).
702	The counterparty that showed up on yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (cpy ID #161).
702	The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota corporation.
702	I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals...
703	Robin Newman Matthew Bender & Co.
704	With the execution of the Wisconsin Gas Company master, this brings the total executed financial masters to 400.
704	The countdown to 500 executed financial masters is now starting!
704	Congratulations to the Legal and Credit teams for getting us to this point and for a job well done!
705	Leslie, Why am I getting this information below?
705	These counterparties are not on my approval lists for the last few days.
705	Did Frank ask you questions re: the counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal Database?
706	With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" equivalant rules?
707	Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think Mark was going to talk to you about it.
707	Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.
707	He feels he is having to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.
707	Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.
707	His phone # is 713/331-5049.
707	FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services.
708	Attached please find the referenced lists.
708	Please note: Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.
708	Even though Peoples Gas is a division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing license was not granted in that name.
708	Further, I earlier shut down Tampa Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas.
709	I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.
709	As we discussed, Dynegy Canada is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done with ECC.
709	Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA.
709	Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in place with either ECC or ENA.
709	Works for me...!
710	I would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may want me to add, don't ever feel bad, when I don't expect something I just need to know what it's about.
710	I hope we can open the EOL Legal Database soon so you can update any comments or notes directly into it.
711	In response to your email: 1.
711	The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received the application by Fedex Thursday.
711	It will take several days for them to process his application.
711	Further, he still needs to attend their training session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade online.
711	2.
711	As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX ACCESS at a time.
711	I have a call into the NYMEX about this.
711	We get a terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no cost.
711	The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, cost free for the first 6 months.
711	After 6 months any cost associated with the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.
711	I have a call into the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.
711	3.
711	Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.
711	Any changes with respect to operators will have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process should continue to be done through the Legal Department.
712	Below are the account numbers at Salomon Smith Barney that you will need to trade NYMEX ACCESS power: For those of you who haven't done business with Salomon Smith Barney before, our trader contact there is John Galperin at (212) 723-7284.
713	Per the request of Mark Taylor, I am forwarding the attached.
714	Attached is the list of the counterparties that EOL wants to approve for emissions auction trading.
714	Please let me know ASAP if there are any counterparties on this list that should not be allowed to trade emissions auctions.
715	Per the note below from Brent, I am going to inactivate this master.
715	Also, per his note, it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to approving any future trades.
716	I had Calpine Power Services Company shut down for financial, and we got the master in signed, so I am going to open them up.
716	Can you add them to tomorrow's list.
716	Thanks!
717	I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.
717	Many of the counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.
717	When I'm done (probably some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due today!), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London.
718	Just a reminder to send me a memo asking me to delete Bob Shultz as and EOL signatory and add Sheri Thomas in his place.
718	Much thanks!
719	To confirm our conversation, can you add "Credit Derivatives" as a new products to my database.
719	We will need the same drop downs as the other produsts (gas trading, financial trading, etc.).
719	Thanks!
720	I am aware that you need a list from me, I am working on it right now.
720	I just got the list from EOL yesterday and I'm reviewing it as fast as I can.
720	My goal is to get it done by the end of my workday, so you should have it when you arrive in the morning.
721	There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's contracting party is usually Enron North America Corp. and London's contracting party is usually Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. We cannot do business under each others' financial master agreements for legal and tax reasons.
721	ENA and Enron Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went away.
721	Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons).
722	Below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs apartment: 1.
722	Paint inside of bathroom cabinets 2.
722	Paint outside and inside of kitchen cabinets 3.
722	Fix bottom of drawer of kitchen cabinet located right of dishwasher 4.
722	Replace closet rod in front bedroom to match other closet's rod 5.
722	Hammer down shelf ends that are loose in closet in back bedroom 6.
722	Clean ends of door hardware that have drips on them.
722	7.
722	Rehang blinds (we'll have to buy new hardware for existing blinds and then I will have to buy new blinds if any were bent by the kids) Did I catch everything?
723	Mark says I need to talk to you about the Credit Derivatives confirmation process...
724	Please add TXU Energy Trading Company to list.
724	We had an old style "ERMS" master in place, so they weren't allowed to do power, but now we have an ISDA in place (even tho' Brant Reves threw out the new guaranty, but that is another story!), so I am going to open them up for weather.
725	Attached is the referenced list.
725	I am responsible for those counterparties originating from Houston Credit.
725	Edmund Cooper is responsible for the UK Credit based counterparties.
725	I am still resolving issues on about 8-10 counterparties.
725	If something doesn't make sense, let me know.
726	Can you let me know what the scoop is on those countries and I will update my memo.
726	Thanks!
727	Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following countries to the non-approved list: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.
727	Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change.
727	Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives: Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..
727	Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.
727	For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).
727	This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.
727	Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
728	You are the best!
729	We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.
729	The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.
729	It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend.
729	Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation...
730	We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm.
730	BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties.
730	I am going to count it as signed, since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.
730	Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me.
730	Much thanks.
731	We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.
731	This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement.
731	Copies will be distributed.
732	Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes!
733	It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.
733	I didn't either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.
733	When you have a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel.
734	I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.
734	I communicated that to Bob Bowen.
734	He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business.
734	Wow!
735	Carol, will you handle this or Mark?
736	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999.
736	This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master.
736	Copies will be distributed.
736	Confirmation Desk: you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now.
737	Here's the list with the missing counterparties.
738	Probably...
739	I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian financial power.
739	I'll need to talk to you about his Monday.
740	Hey guys, take Monday off!
741	ISDA has published the referenced supplement.
741	Among other changes, the supplement adds hundreds of new gas, liquids and power price sources.
741	Copies will be distributed to you.
742	Attached is the referenced list.
742	Some comments: We got a master financial agreement in place with Calpine Power Services Company so it has been opened up to trade all financial.
742	Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial products as well.
742	For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under what names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email about this about a month to two months ago).
742	That letter had the counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division".
742	I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that name.
742	Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions...
743	David, I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.
743	I am the lead contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for EnronOnline.
743	I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group (financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and Credit teams.
743	I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from Friday.
743	Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already trading).
743	I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, we might have for financial trading in Australia.
743	Are there any restricted counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).
743	Have your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?
743	Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of EnronOnline products.
743	Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia?
743	Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover?
743	Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration.
743	Will that be enforceable in Australia?
743	Are there any issues we need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) with respect to a trade?
743	Thanks for your help!
744	I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.
744	They are due the end of July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we always seem to need more time.
745	Sheri, I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination.
746	I sent the documents to Paul Davis on March 6.
747	Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, "Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc."
747	is a bad name.
747	The correct legal name for this counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement database: "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".
747	I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters (713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password Application with the name corrected.
747	Please show this correction in your records as well.
748	Please take me off your distribution.
748	I already bought my new car.
748	Thank
749	I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and provisions.
749	Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that?
750	Did you forget something in your email?
751	Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.
751	1.
751	From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product.
751	It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power.
751	2.
751	Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?
751	Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.
751	What are your thoughts on this?
751	I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.
751	FYI, I currently do not approve the London based counterparties.
751	3.
751	The Australian company number.
751	Does that have to go on every confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?
751	If it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.
751	It is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.
751	FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by London when they arrive for work Friday morning.
752	As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty list.
752	Thinking through this product today and reading through my various emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved financial power product.
752	I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.
752	What do you think?
752	The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have been issued passwords).
753	Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the messenger)...
753	With respect to your form of online GTC: It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty (a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron Australia.
753	In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online "Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation).
753	As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, "Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also, Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and "setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, business day defined as Sydney only, etc. Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place.
753	I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.
753	After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues...
754	Debbie, Thanks for the heads up on this.
754	I've been trying to get David Minns for several days about various issues.
754	Keep me posted.
755	Per an earlier conveersation with Dave, ee weren't quite sure if you have seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online, so I am sending you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the products we offer, as well as the Enron entity that a counterparty would enter into the trade with.
756	Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.
756	David Minns will have to get back to us about all the other products!
756	For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for "US Power Financial Swaps".
756	I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine.
757	Thanks for returning my message.
757	I had an Australian issue come up and anyone who was familiar with Australian law was unreachable and I was in an absolute panic.
757	But as things usually do, this problem worked itself out too!
757	As usual, I am always humbly in your debt...
758	I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and the products such counterparties are approved to trade.
758	Additionally, at the bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.
758	The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel spreadsheets. If I have missed a counterparty let me know).
758	The information for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 6-7 weeks ago.
758	I am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists.
758	As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been entered for those products.
758	You should count them as being approved for everything.
758	Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will delete them.
758	I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look and I will be glad to hear any input.
758	Obviously, we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, so this database may evolve over time.
758	The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike Neves: Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself).
758	Let me know if you have change access by mistake.
758	On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database confidential to the group we have granted view access to.
758	Do not forward this email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.
758	Much thanks!
759	I would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this, but in all honesty I must admit I'm just the idea guy...(I'm know I'm breaking all your illusions about me today, I'll have no more secrets!)
760	1.
760	Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the EnronOnline products.
760	It was my understanding that he had not seen a comprehensive list off all the products we offer.
760	2.
760	However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other country based product, etc..
760	Houston Legal does it every day for every new Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the same.
760	If some other system will be in place in Australia, David Minns will need to discuss that with Mark Taylor and David Forster.
761	Please find attached referenced lists.
761	It is not clear to me yet how we are going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.
761	Also, there were no counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.
761	I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties...
762	Mark, I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you...
763	Lou, I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.
763	I'll need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right form.
764	The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who still needs to complete his training).
764	Please let me know if you cannot log in. I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their perspective why you should not be able to log in.
765	I have tried to call him directly but he was not available.
766	Yes, I left him a voicemail telling him I needed to know a little more about the counterparty so I could make sure i send them the right form (are they US or non-US counterparty, insurance company, energy company, etc).
766	Also, the name and address of his contact and I will send it directly if he would prefer that.
767	We have received an executed amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated March 20, 2000.
767	Copies will be distributed.
768	I will be out Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon for my termite and house inspections for my new house.
769	We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in April.
769	If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to address them in our training.
769	Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll check them against our schedule.
769	Would your group organize this lunch or ours?
769	How many people are we talking about.
769	Only Global Contract or Global Counterparty too?
769	Let me know the details so we can start planning...
770	Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going forward basis.
770	To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.
770	This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us evidence of their FERC licensing.
771	On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is Carthage Energy.
771	Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but we are not there yet.
771	On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my previous approvals.
771	Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am opening them up for all financial and power.
772	I spoke to Harry Collins, one of our emissions lawyers, and he said there should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the emissions auction website, as long as they can trade emissions generally.
772	If you have any specific questions, call Harry Collins at x39692.
773	We have received the following executed Master Agreement: NOTE: This master appears to have been signed in 1996 and didn't make its way down to Houston until now.
773	Type of Contract: Master Agreement (ECT Canada Form) Effective Date: 06/16/95 Executed Date: 06/24/96 Enron Entity: Enron Capital and Trade Resources Canada Corp., now known as Enron Canada Corp. Counterparty: Originally, NOVAGAS CLEARINGHOUSE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, now through name changes and merger, DYNEGY CANADA INC. Transactions Covered: Energy price swaps or option transactions only (no pulp & paper, weather, interest rate & currency or FX) GLOBAL CONTRACTS: We need to get this master inputted immediately into the EnronOnline System so all of the confirmations for ENA and ECC will immediately roll up under this master.
773	CONFIRM DESK: Please immediately start rolling up all the ENA and ECC trades under this master, whether online, offline, or brokered trades.
774	Novagas has a long and tortured history...when you've got a few hours and want to be incredibly bored I'll share it with you.
774	Let's just say that Canada has been the only one aware of this signed master.
774	You can quote my somewhat eloquent words "if it ain't in Legal it ain't!"
775	You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in with the rest of Legal's.
775	Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.
775	Once we are in agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.
775	The theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian counterparties.
775	Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m.
775	the next day (which will be your morning) from the transmittal of the list.
776	In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.
776	This should include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc. Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.
776	Much thanks!
777	Per my conversation with Kathy Bolan at PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation (and my confirmation thereof with Messrs. Suttle and Bowen), all cross-border trades between PG&E Canada and ENA should go under the master between PG&E Canada and ECC.
778	We have received the fully executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999 between ECC and the referenced counterparty.
778	This First Amendment adds the British Columbia Securities representation to the ISDA Master Agreement.
778	Confirm Desk: You no longer have to add this representation to every confirmation.
779	I have not started responding for Australia yet.
780	Can you add Paul Radous in Credit with full edit capability to this database.
780	Much thanks!
781	Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.
781	I have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and physical power (through EPMI).
781	Can you please let me know first, if you have a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties and date of the contract.
781	Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a RUSH.
782	As usual, you are the best!
783	Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.
783	We just got a master in signed with them and they cannot trade weather, pulp & paper & fx.
783	Much thanks!
784	Per my conversation with Kathy Moore this morning, please open the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products.
785	Thanks for your help in getting this done.
785	You're a star!
786	Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.
786	We got a signed master agreement in place with them and I need to change the approvals.
786	Thanks.
787	Can you please add the new credit person below for full edit priviliges to the Financial Trading Agreement database.
787	Much thanks!
788	Did you notice on the spreadsheet for 3/27 they opened a new power product, US East Power Phys Firm ICAP?
789	Do you have any idea what David is trying to get at!
790	I am flying, are you?
790	If you are on my flight I would be happy to have you drive to the airport with me.
790	If you need to know my reservations, I can email them to you.
791	Is everything OK?
792	I'm glad to hear that everything is good.
792	I'm so excited for you, you'll be a wonderful mother!
793	Attached is the proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement with Platt's.
794	Some notes on the attached lists: 3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my earlier approvals.
794	3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do pulp & paper and weather under it.
794	Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information on them to determine what they are and what they can do.
794	Per Credit, AMBAC only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.
794	If we get a parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.
794	In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine what if anything they can do.
794	3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening them up.
794	I sent an email about that earlier this week.
795	On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.
795	Can you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach them to my assignment.
795	I am forever in your debt...
796	Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".
796	Not to get you worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!
796	After all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.
796	(Not to belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".) We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!)
797	Attached is a proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced party.
798	Obviously Frank, you are trying to kill me...!
799	David has sent us a memo re: Procedures for Approval to trade in Australia that I think you will find helpful.
800	I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap participant.
800	For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.
800	So this ball is in Credit's court.
801	Per your request...
802	Sounds good to me!
802	Saturday, 8:00 am at Buffalo Grille it is!
803	Attached is the referenced Confidentiality Agreement.
803	I hope to have the Fieldston one to you shortly.
804	Attached please find the referenced agreement.
805	Per the request of Sara, attached is the form of US online GTC (w/collateral).
806	We have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers.
806	I am sending a copy of the notice to the usual distribution.
807	The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.
807	As to what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we might have had across the board with this counterparty.
807	If you would like to see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.
807	As I just mailed it, it should get there in a few days.
808	Per my voicemail, attached is my list of agreements.
809	Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade credit derivatives.
809	Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , "amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives.
809	Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.
809	I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't.
810	There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.
810	On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this list.
810	We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start responding for them.
810	Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives (even though I haven't "X'ed" them out).
811	We have received the executed Letter Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 3, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.
811	Copies will be distributed.
812	Attached are the Confidentiality Agreements for the referenced counterparties.
813	Attached please find the referenced list.
813	Remember, no credit derivatives are approved for any counterparites unless Credit has indicated they are a credit derivative counterparty on the list.
814	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated April 4, 2000 with the referenced counterparty amending the Electronic Trading Agreement .
814	Copies will be distributed.
815	We have received the executed copy of the amendment dated April 5, 2000 to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
815	Copies will be distributed.
816	We have received fully executed copies of the following Confidentiality Agreements: Energy Argus, Inc. dated April 5, 2000 AccuWeather, Inc. dated April 4, 2000 Copies have been faxed to the counterparties.
816	I will also send copies to Dave Samuels for your files.
817	Attached is the referenced list.
817	Again, my note about credit derivatives not being marked, and also, I am still not responding for Australia yet on a going forward basis.
818	Russell, In the future please put me on all notices about counterparty trading.
818	I am responsible for the Legal Department's approval of online counterparties across all product areas and need to know any limitations that might affect a counterparties' ability to trade.
818	Thanks!
819	Troy Black called me about that C.A.
819	I passed on to you.
819	He said he needed it to go out today and also passed on words from the counterparty to the effect that the C.A.
819	was "non-negotiable and that if we had any comments they need to be minor, or forget about it..."
819	There you have it!
820	We have executed a Letter Agreement dated April 10, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
820	Copies will be distributed.
821	She seemed very nice, like she would make a good employee.
821	I spoke to Liz Sager who, although she didn't directly work with her, got report from her old law firm of people that did, and Liz said to was extremely well liked, and very energetic.
822	I have a letter on its way to Mike Moscoso right now (interoffice mail).
822	We requested 5000 for nat gas any one month, but were only approved for an additional 2000.
822	So we went from 15,000 to 17,000.
822	Welcome back!
823	Attached is an updated list of the Confidentiality Agreements.
824	Attached please find the referenced lists.
824	I am not sending the list for 4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines.
824	I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.
824	Remember, no credit derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are).
825	We do have it signed.
825	However, the Company's name was not correct in the agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead and change the name on the C.A.
825	he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his agreement.
826	Bob, can you send me a copy of the EnronOnline confirm so I can prepare this.
826	Thanks!
827	I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email below.
827	Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response.
827	MUCH THANKS!
827	For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.
827	What rules, besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off exchange trades you might enter into.
827	For instance, here in the U.S. energy commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options might be governed by the SEC.
827	Besides the exchanges your email reflected, what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might enter into?
828	I have not been getting a response from my outside the U.S. attorneys, so I just emailed them a reminder again, and tried to make them feel really guilty.
828	I hope that works!
829	Actually, we girls have that built in guilt gene, it just improves with age...but do I need to speak to your mother?
829	Is there anything you would like to confess...?
830	What can I say...?!
831	David, What Australian laws besides the rules of the exchange would govern the trades?
832	Can you please prepare a print out for us of all the financial masters your records reflect and what type of agreement we have executed .
832	Thanks!
833	FYI, To date, we have executed 21 amendments to ETA's.
834	We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement from the referenced counterparty and I have faxed it to counterparty today.
834	A copy will be sent to Dave.
835	Thanks for your response!
835	On online, when there are Australian counterparties I will just wait to hear from you and include your responses with mine (even tho you will probably tell me they can only trade Australian power!).
835	Do you have a back up yet?
836	We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000 terminating the referenced trade.
836	Per the request of Jennifer de Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the system.
836	I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling.
837	Attached is the referenced agreement.
837	Please do not hesitate to call me if I can be of any further assistance.
837	I am a paralegal in the Legal Dept. My direct phone no is (713) 853-3399.
838	Mike, Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.
838	That would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment screen for the new products.
838	The two new products are: Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth Thanks!
838	By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the master swap list.
838	I think I am going to need your help with that.
839	will someone be sending us the report?
840	I look forward to seeing you!
840	As soon as I get the recipes, I'll forward them on!
841	Who is Legal requested the master?
842	Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 for our luncheon.
842	Can you please confirm that that date is good for your group and also the total head count.
842	Suzanne will take care of ordering lunch for us.
842	Thanks!
843	Effective March 1, 2000, Aquila Energy acquired the assets of USGT (U.S. Gas Transportation Inc.) , with the acquiring entity being USGT/Aquila L.P. USGT has assigned the Electronic Trading Agreement it executed with ENA to USGT/Aquila L.P. A copy of the assignment will be forwarded to Frank Davis.
844	That envelope should probably go to Rob Milnthorp.
844	I'll have a copy walked down to John Lavorato here.
844	It is a list of all of our NYMEX positions, and the list should be provided by Rob to any traders trading NYMEX out of Canada.
845	I have nothing but the counterparty's request for assignment.
846	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 12, 2000.
846	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
847	Attached please find the referenced list.
847	For Tosco Refining Company, it should be set up as Tosco Refining Company, a division of Tosco Corporation.
847	We need to get the incorporated entity on the hook.
848	There is an Australian counterparty on today's list.
849	No conflict with me.
849	I sent the date of the 24th to Anthony and asked him to confirm it with his people and get back to me.
850	Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised to reflect your correct name.
850	Also, while I was revising the document, I added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document name.
850	Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our officers for signature.
851	Can you please add David Minns, a lawyer from our Australia office as an auhorized person with full privileges to the Master Swap Agreement Database (of course, only I should have keyword change and deletion ability).
852	tana jones will attend
853	Is your counterparty on today's list approved?
854	Edmund, You are the only person I have now not heard from.
854	When can I expect to get your response?
855	FYI, cpy below is governmental.
856	I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.
856	My thoughts and prayers are with both of you.
856	She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.
856	I miss you!
857	We have received the following executed Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: March 31, 2000 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: Kellogg Company Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: Weather and foreign exchange
858	Per my conversation with Lisa, I am going to open the referenced counterparty to trade financial.
859	I will be out Monday morning for my home inspection.
859	Also, I have my Scenic Texas board meeting at 2:00 pm in Dallas on Friday, so depending when I can get plane reservations, I will be out some or all of Friday.
860	On the attached list please note that per my email of 04/17/00, U.S. Gas Transportation, Inc. has been acquired by Aquila.
860	Future trading for this counterparty should be done out of the name USGT/Aquila LP.
861	Any update yet?
862	Jan, that was good, thanks for sharing it!
863	Mark asked if you could work on the following with our new secondee, Jason.
863	I provided Jason a hard copy yesterday since he didn't have a computer yet.
863	Thanks!
864	I've been a little distracted.
864	I've had a contract on a new house, and we had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving forward for a May 5 closing.
864	Also, I have had short in an electric line that keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!
864	Dalzenia has been in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can replant my garden...it's always something.
864	Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.
864	How do I go about doing that?
865	My closing is set for June 5, move-in date for my new house is June 9, so there should be no problem.
866	We have a new lawyer that started in our group yesterday.
866	His name is Jason Peters.
866	Can you get him added to the Master Swap Agreement database ASAP.
866	Thanks.
866	How goes moving the Portland masters?
867	I am available Saturday after my morning run.
867	If you would like some help I would be happy to help out!
868	Can we get some credit?
868	Much thanks!
869	I needed to whine with you yesterday about my favorite nat gas trader and couldn't get hold of you...and then my favorite lazy paralegal already passed on some of her work to me!
870	Can you give view access only to Marie Heard, Robbi Rossi, and Cynthia Harkness with Bandwidth Legal to the referenced database.
870	Thanks!
871	It appears the online people have revised the initial counterparty list.
872	FYI Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at Cadwalader to determine if using the word "exchange" in a corporation's name would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.
872	Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word "exchange" .
872	As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing so without concern.
872	He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in using "exchange" in your corporate name, however, putting "exchange" in a company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.
872	He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.
873	I guess you mean Wendi, no Molly?
874	I forget when you are coming?
874	If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in the Asia/Pacific Group will be having his XVIII Annual La Dolce Vita Party which is always a great blast, and I'll secure you an invite too...let me know...!
875	This time I just pulled out the notebook with the drafts of confidentiality agreements you left one of them to do, and they didn't bother to file them in the binder, they just stuck them in so when I pulled the file out, the documents fell out.
876	The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).
876	After my email went out, Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the exchange and less toward the tranportation.
876	They used words like "online clearinghouse" and the like!
876	So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.
876	I haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it.
877	Mr. Uretsky, At the request of Michael Danielson, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.
877	If the agreement meets with your approval, could you please have it executed by an authorized officer of Viant Corporation and fax it to me for signature by Enron North America Corp. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call me.
877	My phone no.
877	is (713) 853-3399 and my fax no.
877	is (713) 646-3490.
877	Thanks for your help.
878	We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated April 10, 2000, effective as of November 25, 1997, wherein Tembec Inc. assigned its interest in Contract No. #J7774.1 dated March 23, 1998 to National Bank of Canada.
878	Copies will be distributed.
879	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000.
879	This amendment revises the ISDA Master Agreement with the referenced counterparty to bring the agreement up to current form standards with changes including, but not limited to: 1.
879	Adding the Canadian Securities Acts representation; 2.
879	Making certain changes to elections with respect to Payments on Early Termination and amending the Setoff language; 2.
879	Makes changes to certain credit provisions, including letter of credit provisions, the form of letter of credit, the Independent Amount,, and amends the definition of "Material Adverse Change" .
879	Copies will be distributed.
880	On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of Canadian.
880	Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.
880	So if they are, shut them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.
880	Of course, all counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a determination...but you know that...!
881	I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this counterparty, ENA doesn't).
881	I am adding a statement to the effect that these Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master Agreement.
881	Can you confirm that for me.
881	Much thanks!
881	Too bad you won't be here for the party.
881	It's always a good one.
881	Also, Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here early enough to do that either...
881	Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.
881	Don't be shy about calling me if you need any help with anything!
881	I mean it!
882	All's I have to say is I was here this morning before 7:00 am, and I was the only person here until 8:00 am (if you catch my drift)...
883	Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?
883	Also, she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc. If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's ready to leave...
884	Yes to both questions...
885	I hope we are confirming trades under the new TXU ISDA Master...?!
886	I have forwarded the Statoil/J.Aron trades down to Bob Klein and Jeff Sorenson to sign off on the actual deals listed.
886	I'll keep you posted...
887	Would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since I am going to have to send it up to Canada for signature.
887	Much thanks!
888	We have received the faxed executed Confidentiality Agreement dated April 18, 2000 with Fieldston Publications.
888	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
889	I'm not Tim.
889	Perhaps you'd better contact him some other way.
890	I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.
890	The only thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated out.
890	What's happening with that?
891	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.
891	The copy will be forwarded to Dave Samuels.
891	It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.
891	If there is some otherr person than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know.
892	Attached is our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty.
892	cc: Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel
893	There is a document called "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" in Marie's directory where we all input any CA we have sent.
893	For some reason since last week it has appeared as a "read only" document", so I cannot input the agreements I am working on right now. Can you get that fixed. Thanks!
894	Attached is our form of Confidentiality Agreement which we would prefer to use.
894	If after reviewing our agreement you still prefer to use your own form, Carol St. Clair, an attorney in our group will have to get back to you with our comments.
894	I will wait to hear from you.
895	Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!
895	I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth counterparties: 1.
895	Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 28, 2000.
895	It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global Contracts.
895	2.
895	The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC should be used here.
895	If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get someone who can!
896	You are the one!
896	I hope everything works out, keep me posted and let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
897	Faxed the signed document to me at (713) 646-3490.
897	My direct phone in case you have any questions is (713) 853-3399.
898	At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.
898	I have included our phone numbers below in case you have any comments you would like to discuss with us.
898	We look forward to hearing from you.
898	Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel (713) 853-3989
899	We have faxed to Counterparty the fully signed Mutual Disclosure Agreement dated as of May 2, 2000.
899	Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults.
900	Frank, can you email us both a copy of the GTC that the counterparty is seeing on the system.
900	Thanks!
901	The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.
901	Would you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like me to fedex it to you?
902	Lorna, Thanks for following up on this!
903	Getchen is in our personnel dept.
903	She will coordinate filling job positions with candidates.
903	If you just emailed her your resume, you might want to give her a few days because she is working on lots of jobs.
903	I've used her before, so you might want to mention my name, say I work in the Enron North America Legal Dept. She is really sweet.
904	Taffy, Can you take care of faxing him a copy of the ISDA and guarantees ASAP.
904	Thanks!
905	Attached is the form of Letter of Credit you requested.
905	Also, I am still working to get that info from London on the margin funds and securities.
905	They are working on it so I hope to get it to you soon.
905	They are the only holdout.
906	Just to give a head's up, In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents for her group.
906	The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy Zipper, Vice President.
906	FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of
907	Let's chat about attached...!
908	I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.
908	He has come up with more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J.
908	Aron, and now Bob Bowen is checking out the list.
908	They hope to have it to me by the end of the day.
908	It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades.
908	Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.
908	Are you with me on this?
909	It wasn't at the bottom of my list, but it appears it was at the bottom of London's list.
910	Per your request a few weeks ago, Global Contracts prepared a list of executed financial masters for Bob Bowen which he forwarded up to me.
910	Let me know what you think.
911	Attached is the form of Confidentiality Agreement.
911	Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service.
912	As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there was any.
912	Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.
912	We need to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global Contract and the online crew.
912	Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.
912	Thanks.
913	We have received the executed Confidentiality agreement with Human Code, Inc. dated May 3, 2000.
913	Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults.
914	The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.
914	She really isn't a great seamstress.
914	I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.
914	Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used them.
914	I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and does a great job.
914	Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.
914	She is an absolute sweetheart.
914	I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).
914	Only to my select, special friends!
915	Well, I was here by 7:30 this am and guess who's still not here yet?!
915	Think harder, I know you can get this one...!
916	Anthony, You never got back to me on whether this date was good and the total head count.
916	Can youu please confirm this.
916	Thanks.
917	We have received the Confidentiality Agreement with Novo MediaGroup, Inc. dated May 2, 2000.
917	Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob I am also attaching an updated list of the EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements.
918	Ding, ding, ding...!
918	You're ready for Who Wants to be a Millionaire!
919	I have created a new subdirectory aptly called "Confidentiality Agreements" and have moved Marie's list of Confidentiality Agreements there, the list of EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreement and the two EnronOnline forms of Confidentiality Agreements.
920	What is going on with the revisions to the tax language in the ISDA?
920	I spoke to Marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of "ISDAexh.doc "was sent to Rhett Jackson for review and as far as she know it hadn't been signed off on.
920	Obviously, we still have the old language in the form and we need to get this updated.
921	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with MarchFIRST dated April 27, 2000.
921	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
922	In my directory.
923	You don't appear to have attached the list...
924	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated May 2, 2000 with the referenced counterparty.
924	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
925	I'm ok.
925	Can you put it on my calendar.
925	Thanks.
926	1.
926	5/2/00 List: Per my conv.
926	w/ CIBC World Markets, they are a U.K. incorporated company, and will be trading only out of New York 2.
926	5/3/00 List: We are not changing our prior approvals, which included "no power" , which Leslie Hansen has reconfirmed.
927	We definitely have enough people for a party.
927	I haven't heard back from some people yet, I'll keep trying.
927	I hope to have some responses when I get home from work tonight.
927	Atached is of list of the status so far: What do you think?
928	Andrea, The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.
928	That red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.
928	Do you want to choose another one.
928	We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.
928	Let me know your choice!
928	- Black Bean Dip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc
929	Great choice, I got several responses last night and that was not one of them!
929	All the recipes look really good (as usual).
930	Suzanne, Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.
930	Can you coordinate with him the exact head count as we get closer.
930	Thanks!
931	I got several responses last night and this morning by email, so I am attaching a revised list.
932	We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World Markets plc.
932	Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron Canada Corp. Copies will be distributed
933	I've got the dinner schedules for 7:30 pm.
933	Your choice was perfect.
933	There was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook.
933	I couldn't have planned it better!
934	Attached are the recipes.
934	I sent you them all because they all looked so good.
934	Will you be talking to Steve?
934	I left him a voicemail about the dinner.
934	I have scheduled him for the garlic bread.
934	I guess I will just mail him the recipe.
934	- Black Bean Dip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc
935	I left a message for Judy Wells and will keep you posted.
935	Hopefully by the end of the weekend I should have an exact head count so I can tell people how much to make.
935	So far we've got 12.
935	The only recipe so far that is unclaimed is the Roasted Red Pepper Dip, you could either do that, or based on the number of people, you may do another of the meat recipe, since probably that will be the most expensive.
935	Why don't we chat (via email!) Monday and figure out the best way to go.
935	I've got a call into Peter Shaddock to see if I can borrow his barbecue grill and if he can get it to my house.
935	Another thing too, does the Church have folding tables and chairs to borrow?
935	My table will only sit 6 at the best.
936	I can go either way on this.
936	I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not enough tables.
936	But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.
936	I used to have a nice folding table but it was stolen out of my garage.
936	If you host it I would be happy to help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...!
937	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex A for the referenced counterparty.
937	Please call me at x33399 or Sara at x35620 if we can be of further assistance.
938	Do you have a fax no?
938	I could fax them to you...
939	Anthony, Unless your questions relate to an online problem, can you address your master questions to either of the two Susans.
939	Thanks!
940	Are we in agreement that you will be hosting the dinner.
940	If so, I will need to call everyone and let them know the change of plans.
940	In furtherance of that, I will need direction to your house to provide them.
941	Lisa, I was returning your phone call to Carol St. Clair about the agreement and deleted the message by mistake before I got to your phone no.
941	Can you give me a call at (713) 853-3399.
941	Thanks!
942	I'll wait to hear from you tommorow.
943	At the request of Anita Herrera, I am enclosing a copy of a list that shows the discrepancies that our records show from the list we were sent of trades to be assigned to J. Aron.
943	Please resolve the trades issues directly with Bob Bowen.
943	His # is 713/853-7859.
944	At the request of Anita Herrera, I am sending you a list of discrepancies with the J. Aron trades.
944	I tried to send this earlier and attached the wrong documents.
944	Please disregard that email and delete it.
944	Thanks.
945	Can you take care of sending him the executed documents!
946	Can you help me figure out the Portland thing so we can get this database
947	Attached is our bilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement when both parties are providing Confidential Information.
948	I don't think you can bird dog her too much.
948	She receives in the emails and forwards them on to the relevant job group.
948	The person with the job then decides who they do or do not want to interview.
948	I don't think Gretchen will have much to do with that.
949	If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database from "Executed" to "Executed-Under Amendment".
949	Once a master is executed, "Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you should ever choose.
949	If you change it to "Draft Sent", "Under Negotiation", etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters.
950	How many times do we have to say this?!
951	Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement.
951	We have not consented to the Statoil/J.
951	Aron assignment (in principal yet, in actuality, no).
951	We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people a list of the disputed trades to resolve.
951	Once we are in agreement about the trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.
951	Only then can we move the trades...
952	The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us when they approve our exemptions.
952	Because we have so many commodities we are applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 (last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).
952	So we've got a lttle more time to work on it.
952	I will probably start notifying the various group's that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the middle or toward the end of May.

954	There has been a change in plans, the dinner is now going to be held at Pastor Beth's.
954	A list of who is coming, what they are preparing and directions to Pastor Beth's house are attached.
954	Laura, is Steve getting the recipe from you or Pastor Beth?
954	Pastor Beth, I've got you coordinating with Matthias & Karen.
954	I've faxed the recipes to Karl & Ulf.
954	July Weller is the only one I need to assign a recipe.
954	I'm hoping she'll do one of the Gazpacho recipes since it's a little more complicated.
954	Everyone else I having doing double recipes.
954	I'll keep you posted...
955	I just forwarded directions to Pastor Beth's and a note about the number of people.
955	Did you get it?
955	We just got Windows 2000 and I'm having trouble with my emails...
956	I have opened the referenced counterparty to trade weather online.
956	However, they should continue to use the same special form of confirm that they are using offline until we get an ISDA Master in place with them.
957	We cannot move the trades until we agree to the assignment, which we have not done yet.
957	We are resolving the trades being assigned, so don't move the trades until you hear from me.
957	Bob Bowen has been working on this on the confirm desk side.
958	Yes, we will be having it at Pastor Beth's.
958	Do you need directions?
958	It's at 7:00 pm.
959	We will have 14 people.
960	Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement you requested.
961	At your request, attached is the bilateral Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty.
962	This Koch trade you sent me is a London based Credit counterparty, not a Houston counterparty so I have no information on it.
962	You are going to have to resolve this with London Legal, Edmund Cooper who is an attorney in
963	Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.
963	I need to respond to EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.
963	The list is broken up into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).
963	You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?
963	They can potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at them like any new counterparty.
963	Saying that, what we really expect them to trade is the Singapore based group of products.
964	Attached are the referenced lists.
964	With respect to the list for 5/8/00, Imperial Oil Resources and Pengrowth Corporation were on the initial approval lists.
964	We have a duplicate Global Counterparty # open for Imperial.
964	The second one needs to be shut down.
965	Attached is the form of ETA Amendment we executed with Koch Energy Trading.
965	The referenced Diamond Shamrock/Koch joint venture would like to execute the same one.
965	Is this OK with you.
965	Forever in your debt...Tana
966	1.
966	Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty.
966	Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron guarantees out with the counterparty?
966	2.
966	Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty?
967	It looks like you finally made the cut again!
968	I have lots of blanks on my approvals on the attached list for several European products.
968	If you know any of the answers, can you please just hand write them in and fax them back to me, or email a more recent list you might that addresses the European approvals.
968	Much thanks.
969	She didn't return my phone calls from yesterday either, so if you can go ahead and double the batch, just making one batch w/o the shrimp for our vegetarian and non-fish eaters.
969	Thanks for your help!
970	I am still trying to get the countries of incorp.
970	on the Japan List for you.
970	Tom Moran is out today so I have to get them from Tracy Ngo.
971	What do the numbers "4" and "8" mean on your list?
972	I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.
972	Meanwhile, what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.
972	I am going to have to email people the link to get in.
973	Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to people outside of Legal and Credit.
973	You will be able to use this database to verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues.
973	Jeff, once we have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is still in progress).
973	Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to have view access to this database.
973	I will have to email them the link.
974	You're a star!
975	Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.
975	I ran them by Mark Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.
975	If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no.
975	is (713) 853-7459.
975	I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in touch with me my phone no.
975	is (713) 853-3399.
975	We look forward to hearing from you.
976	I understand either of you gentlemen can advise me on what legal issues, if any, we might have with trading the new Singapore online products with my US based counterparty list..?
976	Do we have any issues trading those products with counterparties incorporated in any specific country?
977	Attached please find referenced list.
977	A few notes: No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese counterparties.
977	Re: Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth.
978	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 11, 2000.
978	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
979	Per our conversation, I am attaching a copy of the form of Enron Corp. Guaranteee which has been sent today to Enron Corp. for signature.
979	My direct phone no.
979	in case you need to get hold of me is (713) 853-3399.
980	We have received the following two executed Confidentiality Agreements: 1.
980	Dow Jones & Company, Inc. dated May 11, 2000 Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels.
980	I am also attaching a revised copy of the Online Confidentiality Agreement List.
980	Please let me know if you have any comments or questions on the list.
981	No wonder you couldn't find it!
981	Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can see it, the job will be open outside Enron.
981	Didn't you think the job sounded perfect!
982	Are Micheal Khajeh-Hoori and Deepak Sitlani in Credit?
982	I know Michael Schuh is in Legal.
983	I understand there you can't find the 5/8/00 list.
984	I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to physical trading and the online account.
984	I also called the company and got a copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment.
985	can you give these three people in London Legal access to the Master Swap Agreement Database.
985	Thanks.
986	At the request of Rahil Jafry, attached is our form of bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.
986	Please let me know if the attached meets with your approval.
987	Attached is the list referenced above, revised to approve Imperial Oil Resources (cpy ID 58981) for all products but power (of course no credit derivatives).
987	The other Imperial Oil Resources Limited from the original approvals (cpy ID5193), I would like shut down for all products until I am provided information as to how it differs from the other Imperial Oil Resources.
987	Whew...!!!
988	The check is in the mail...no really...!!!
988	Actually, I meant to give it to you at breakfast last weekend, but I have no memory.
988	Do you want to run Saturday again.
988	Do the Rose Garden run?
989	How about this afternoon, right after lunch, before I start getting phone calls!
990	Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero will not trade with us under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.
990	They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is attached below.
990	I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.
990	After talking to Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.
990	We will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.
991	I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.
991	She has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and directors, which appears to have been approved.
991	The banking resolution went to Julia today for signature.
991	Do we need to adopt any other resolutions (brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).
991	How about adoption of the trading policy?
992	Attached please find the referenced lists.
993	I spoke to Greg Johnston, one of the Canadian lawyers who is currently seconded here, and have determined the following: Imperial Oil Resources is an Alberta limited partnership.
993	All Canadian transactions are entered into with this counterparty.
993	Imperial Oil Resources Limited is the General Partner of Imperial Oil Resources.
993	We do not transact business with this entity.
994	Thanks for the T-Shirt and the magic wand.
994	People have already been at my desk trying to steal my magic wand, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.
994	That was sweet of you to think of me!
995	Done...
996	The ballots are due in New York on June 20, and there are no provisions made for faxing the ballots, so we need to mail them in time to be received by the due date.
997	Per conv.
997	w/Anthony, we should expect 13 people.
997	We do not need to teleconference anyone in. Anthony wanted the London Global Contracts people on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact London Legal if they would like a presentation.
998	Sorry for my hold up on this list.
998	I had an issue with the division/dba approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.
998	We will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with divisions/dba's in the future.
998	For this Koch counterparty: Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name gets amended to read as follows: Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
998	If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.
998	(FYI, this is the way we styled the ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.)
999	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 12, 2000.
999	Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Teresa Smith.
1000	We have received Confidentiality Agreemend executed as of May 17, 2000.
1000	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1001	The list looks OK except take off Clement Abrams and Ted Murphy.
1002	Luanne Geison at J. Aron left me a message that their guaranty is being processed and she expect to have it ready early to mid week and will fedex it to us.
1003	You can take them off.
1003	I spoke to Sara and Marie didn't want them to attend and that is fine with Sara.
1004	With respect to El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., this counterparty was on yesterday's list as an amended counterparty, but it is actually a new counterparty.
1004	It should be approved for all products but power.
1005	Thanks Bob!
1006	Per my conversation a minute ago with Leslie Hansen, El Paso Merchant Energy is OK to trade power, so I have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that change.
1007	I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!
1007	We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood Services.
1007	I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before.
1007	We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft master to about a year ago.
1007	Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial with us?
1007	Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?
1007	By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?
1007	You Credit guys live high on the hog!
1007	You must have a bigger budget than us!
1008	At the request of Mike Danielson, I am attaching our form of NDA.
1008	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 (fax no 713/646-3490) or Mike at (713) 853-9052.
1008	We look forward to hearing from you.
1009	I'm not exactly sure what your email is getting at.
1009	No matter what the financial product is, if we have a financial master agreement in place we should tie the financial master to the product.
1010	I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 11:00 am.
1011	Glencore Ltd. is a Swiss corporation.
1012	I can't do anything until I get Credit and Stacy approval.
1013	At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.
1013	It is our desire to have this agreement executed before the Tuesday, May 30 meeting with Louise and Mark Crosno.
1013	If you have any comments or questions please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Taylor, V.P.
1013	and Assistant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7549.
1013	Sincerely, Sr. Legal Specialist
1014	Please ignore my last list and use this one!!
1015	We have received the executed amendment to the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 16, 2000.
1015	Copies will be distributed.
1016	Mark Taylor, the attorney I work for, has agreed to the changes you made, so if you would like to process the agreement on your side and fax the signed copy to me I will have it executed by an authorized officer here.
1016	Thanks for your prompt review and have a nice Memorial Day holiday!
1017	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 29, 2000.
1017	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1018	Here's that physical deal you were inquiring about.
1018	Stacy is a physical lawyer and will be taking care of that assignment.
1019	Where are you going?!
1020	Good luck with the next stage of your life.
1020	It has been a pleasure working with you!
1021	I would like to take the following time off: Wednesday, May 31 - I need to leave at 3:00 My new house closing is on Monday June 5 at Partner's Title in the old Texas Commerce Bank Bldg.- they haven't set the time yet I will be taking two days off in June to move into my new house - June 12 & 13 My old house sale closes on Monday, June 19 - also at Partner's Title - they haven't set the time yet Let me know if there are any problems...
1022	So I guess I'll be hearing from you when you need Confidentiality Agreements.
1022	So we'll still get to work together!
1023	Lorraine, Mike is wrong.
1023	I never got the fax of the executed NDA.
1023	May he could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!
1024	Can you get the new attorney in our group, Jason Peters access to both the Financial Trading Database and the Online Trading Database.
1024	Please let us know when he has access.
1024	Thanks.
1025	Attached is the revised list of our Online Confidentiality Agreements.
1025	Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or changes.
1026	Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.
1026	It appears Aurora Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.
1026	We have an ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.
1026	Further, per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.
1027	I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.
1027	Someone went into one of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it wasn't.
1027	If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please consult with him.
1027	Thanks
1028	Edmund, Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a master swap agreement executed.
1028	With this email Global Counterparty can open the counterparty.
1028	We then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo.
1028	If we get the master in signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation (like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending the email.
1028	Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.
1028	We used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.
1028	Does this make sense?...
1028	I am now going to look for one with special instructions...
1028	Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed documents I send down to them.
1028	Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a copy in the Global Contract file)
1029	Mary Solmonson is a Senior Director with ENA.
1029	Business purpose was to discuss online issues.
1030	We have received the following executed Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border) Effective Date: 08/14/94 Executed Date: 05/11/00 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: J. Aron & Company Transactions Covered: All products, except pulp & paper Please note the following: 1.
1030	This ISDA Master Agreement supersedes and replaces the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated as of 03/09/93.
1030	2.
1030	Incorporated is the ISDA Master Agreement is the consent to the assignment by Columbia Energy Services Corporation ("CES") to ENA of the financial transactions between CES and J. Aron & Company.
1030	3.
1030	J. Aron & Company is the Calculation Agent and Confirming Agent under the ISDA Master Agreement.
1031	Yup, FX & Currency Option provisions added.
1031	!
1031	I hope to have our database open to you soon so you can look and see what definitions are included.
1032	What group did you go to?
1033	How about Melissa Murphy, or anyone else that prepares financial power confirms?
1034	never mind...
1035	We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the "Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit.
1035	Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access so I can email them the agent to open the database.
1035	Much thanks!
1036	This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.
1036	Stacy Dickson will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears she has not yet.
1037	You scared me...I went in to make sure I sent the list to everybody!!
1038	How about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading?
1039	I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them up they will have a cow!!
1039	1.
1039	When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.
1039	They are insistent that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to in the master apply.
1039	2.
1039	All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, should roll up under the master.
1039	As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.
1039	I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!!
1040	I am still waiting for responses on the 5/30/00 list.
1040	I hope to have it to you shortly.
1041	Thanks, as usual!!
1042	FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until I am given further instruction.
1042	As with all the online documents I am getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.
1042	We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.
1042	The original is being sent to Dave.
1043	We have received the executed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement dated 5/24/00 with the referenced party.
1043	Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Mike Danielson.
1044	Just a reminder that I will be at my house closing Monday morning...
1045	As you requested...
1046	FYI, you've got several people on the referenced resolution that are no longer in your group.
1046	You might want to take a look at it...
1047	We have a new paralegal in our group, Samantha Boyd, she just started Monday.
1047	Can you get her Master Swap Agreement access.
1047	Thanks!
1048	I am going to have to leave the Group Meeting a little early tomorrow.
1048	The online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 10:30 am Tom Moran and I are going to give a presentation on online approval procedures.
1049	Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list: We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial trading effective today.
1049	All financial trading should be done out of Utilicorp United Inc. This counterparty was on the original approval list, and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.
1049	Credit will put them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all financial immediately.
1050	I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial.
1050	Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until they get your email.
1050	Thanks.
1051	Samantha, When you get in let's take a look and see if you can get into the Master Swap Agreement Database.
1052	Attached is your agreement.
1053	I have jury duty scheduled for June 23 at 8:00 am.
1054	At Stephanie's request, I am approving the following three counterparties to transact Enron power SALES only prior to these counterparties coming out on tonight's Credit approval list (when we will do the full approvals): The three new counterparties are: GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania Electric Company GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan Edison Company GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central Power and Light Company Call me if you have any questions...
1055	It is always a pleasure working with the online team, You all keep me busy but you are always kind and thankful, and believe me, those thanks are always appreciated!
1056	Correct!
1057	I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type of financial power transactions they can enter into: 1.
1057	The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options 2.
1057	CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options 3.
1057	Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy prices swap, put & call options.
1057	Per my discussions with Tom, this counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power.
1057	They have a really old form of agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial transactions.
1057	I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an ISDA.
1057	I am going to talk to Credit about this.
1057	They will definitely not be able to trade financial power by Monday...
1057	4.
1057	PXRE Corporation - weather only 5.
1057	Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only 6.
1057	Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only
1058	In my absence on Monday and Tuesday, can you forward the counterparty approval lists to Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, and she will forward them on to my distribution, so we can at least get people reviewing the lists while I am out.
1058	Much thanks!
1059	Boy, I'd like to know where I'm going to be for the next 2 days too!
1060	I look forward to it!
1060	I was talking to Genia and I also heard how lovely your house looked...I can't wait to see yours too!
1061	On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.
1061	Per my discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for US power and emissions.
1061	This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved by the FERC to trade power.
1061	Until we are provided that info, we cannot open them up for power.
1061	US emissions has been opened.
1061	P.S.
1061	If Utilicorp.
1061	need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on the contract.
1062	Attached is the referenced Annex B. Call me if I can be of further help.
1063	Always my pleasure.
1063	...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?!
1064	I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!
1064	I heard we weren't going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend will achieve "favored Credit person" status.
1065	Dan, I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.
1065	Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting it signed.
1065	Her phone no.
1065	is 853-9188.
1065	I understand you need it signed by Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.
1065	As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.
1065	As soon as we hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's attention at fax: (713) 646-3490).
1065	Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).
1065	Either of them can sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice President.
1065	After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).
1065	If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk to Mark directly.
1065	His phone no.
1065	is 853-3399.
1066	You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.
1066	For you, it would have much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.
1066	I would certainly want to stay on Marie good side.
1066	Though I know it is tough to compete with sweet Russell...
1067	I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday of next week.
1067	In my absence, Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, will forward the Counterparty Approval Lists to you once she receives them from Credit.
1067	Please return any responses you might have to me.
1067	Thanks!
1068	I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality agreements.
1068	On a going forward basis can you please provide that information along with the other info you give me.
1068	Thanks!
1068	I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.
1068	If you have a RUSH Confidentiality Agreement that can't wait until Wednesday, call Mark Taylor at x37459 and he will find someone else in our Group to prepare it.
1068	Louise, don't worry about Continental.
1068	Mark is working on getting it signed in my absence!
1069	Airlines!
1070	How soon they forget!!!
1071	Correct!
1072	I forwarded your resume last week onto my last contact that might have a join London.
1072	The London Legal Dept. just seconded two outside lawyers, so thare properly staffed for the moment.
1072	Then I spoke to the Global Contractspeople, and they didn't need anyone in London, but might have been interestif you wanted to go to Japan.
1072	The last Group is the online trading group.
1072	I forwarded your resume to the head of that groupp last week.
1072	We'll see thisweek...
1072	cc: Subject: London Hello from Germany.
1072	I was just writing to make sure that you did receive mresume by fax.
1072	Hopefully that went smoothly.
1072	And also, My dad says, "Have you found me a job yet?"
1072	Just kidding about that, he said said to say that.
1072	I%ll be in London starting thursday or friday, but feel free to email me at this address with any info.
1072	Thanks, Matthew Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at
1073	Are you going to be sending me some credit?
1074	I'm so depressed...I wanted to work on this for you...!!
1075	I don't know what a terminations number is?!
1076	Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and moved into my new house.
1076	I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.
1076	This yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.
1076	Hopefully, some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house!
1077	Here's the excuse we need to get me up there for the Stampede!
1077	Isn't it coming up soon?
1078	Yes, we do have a standard Enron guaranty form.
1078	It is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc (both the Enron & counterparty guarantees are in there).
1079	We have not yet received the executed documents.
1080	You can go back sending the counterparty lists only to me and Mark Taylor.
1080	Thanks!
1081	Just a reminder that I will be taking Friday afternoon off to meet the cable tv guy, then, my closing on my old house is set for Monday at 3:30 pm.
1082	How can a non-bank be a multibranch entity?
1082	If I remember, we spent a hour with London over the phone discussing just this issue!
1083	I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.
1083	I mentioned to him our agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner, he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously, mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just changing it for any cross-border issues.
1083	I told him I would run it by our Credit Dept.
1084	We got a call from the NYMEX today, and they received another Access terminal that appears to be slated for Enron.
1084	My understanding is that we have the five terminals that I ordered.
1084	You do have your two in Portland, don't you?
1084	Please confirm that for me.
1084	Thanks!
1085	We have received the executed Second Amendment to Guaranty Agreement dated as of June 9, 2000.
1085	This amendment changed the guaranty of Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA ("Guarantor") with respect to the physical transactions with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. and financial transactions with Neumin Production Co. to an unlimited guaranty.
1085	The original guaranty amendment will be sent to Credit.
1086	Per my conv.
1086	a minute ago with Maryann Friel, they will be fedexing the documents out to us tonight!
1087	You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they would like to send us one we will take a look at it.
1088	We have finally received the executed Termination Agreement for the two Koch physical trades done in error on EOL (which have already rolled off the books!).
1088	The deal nos.
1088	are EOL Nos. 103992 and 104018.
1088	I am sending the original to Bob Bowen.
1089	We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assigned two physical trades to CIBC World Markets Plc.
1089	Those two deal Nos are EOL deal no 137945 and 149472.
1089	The originals will be sent to Bob Bowen.
1090	To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information: 1.
1090	The correct legal name of the counterparty 2.
1090	Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential information).
1090	Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since it is written more in our favor.
1090	3.
1090	The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
1090	4.
1090	The address of the counterparty 5.
1090	The phone and fax number of the counterparty Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.
1091	You're the best!
1092	The Power Desk directed me to give John Galperin, our broker with Salomon, Smith Barney a call to get the May Entergy volumes.
1092	John spoke to the NYMEX and they came back with a figure of -0- contracts traded in May, with a total of 34 Entergy contracts traded so far for 2000 (all months).
1093	I can be there, but I have to be home by 1:00, because the cable tv guy is going to show up sometime between 1-5.
1094	Tanya, "eligible" is spelled wrong...otherwise, lovely credit worksheet!
1095	At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our form of EnronOnline Password Application, Electronic Trading Agreement, and a sample of each of a financial and physical online GTC.
1096	I will be able to attend.
1097	I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North America and its trading affiliate offices.
1097	This includes Houston, Calgary, London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.
1097	Can someone with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this to.
1097	Thanks!
1098	If we are going to vote on the NYMEX demutualization plan the ballots are due tomorrow, so today is your last possible day to get them out, since it only provides for mail in ballots, no faxes this time.
1098	I check and both Mark and Kevin are in, for right now!
1099	I do not have an individual list.
1099	It will have to got to all the employees in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is pretty much the list I had below.
1100	I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and online transactions.
1100	Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.
1100	PP&L tells me that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have not received such approval.
1100	With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).
1100	It seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.
1100	Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with assigning the online account over...
1101	Wouldn't you like to know which of the two Susan's gave her notice today!?!
1102	I called Haedicke to check on the status of his Rappaport conversation, and he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax in the ballots, which I have done (I got Kevin's too).
1103	I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.
1103	Also, London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too.
1104	Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.
1104	Also, I would expect that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?
1105	Attached are the referenced lists.
1105	On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the original list, I open them up for it just in case.
1105	Also, I opened them up for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for financial.
1106	Please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below (I think Sydney is our Australia office).
1106	I have revised the letter a little and am reattaching it.
1106	Thanks!
1107	Mike, I thought you were taking care of this for me.
1107	What happened?
1107	P.S.
1107	Does Samantha Boyd has full access to the database also?
1108	I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions.
1108	First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep in. Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry about that.
1108	However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.
1108	Unless you know of a reason to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.
1108	Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.
1108	Will they be financially trading separately under those departments?
1108	And if so should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?
1108	Anything else special you think I need to mention?
1109	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between Continental Airlines, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline LLC dated June 19, 2000.
1109	A copy will be distributed to Daniel Diamond and Dave Samuels.
1110	Just a followup note: We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).
1110	I think it would be good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.
1110	So my question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).
1111	FYI, I spoke to my contact in the NYMEX Marketing Group and she told me that the NYMEX demutualization vote passed 140-11.
1112	The draft of the email you sent Mark looks OK in terms of its content.
1112	Is there any way I will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails?
1113	Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the future.
1113	Please forward this email on to other members of your group that might be responsible for filing original guarantees.
1114	Your list looks good!
1115	Thanks, that was indeed what I was asking!
1116	I have to move some final things out of my old house.
1116	I hope I close tomorrow!
1116	If you would like to meet me at my new house, and then we could run over quick and grab the final things I could go after...
1117	I'm still getting the silent treatment!
1118	She's not too far away from snapping...!
1118	I'm afraid to say anything.
1119	Yes it does.
1119	It includes any original guarantees we may be giving or receiving.
1120	Just a reminder that I hope to be out this afternoon (as of this morning my old house closing is set for 3:00 pm, keep your fingers crossed it goes through this time!).
1120	Also, I have morning jury duty tomorrow.
1121	You are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision!
1122	I have prepared a form of transmittal memo for sending the original guarantees down to Credit.
1122	I though you might want to use it as a template.
1123	The memo applies to ENA and its other trading affiliates, Enron Canada Corpand Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.).
1123	If you work forany of these trading affiliates, this memo would apply to you.
1123	Because ofthe constraints of our company wide broadcast system, they could not limitthe email in some offices to only those companies, so we had to send it outto the whole office.
1123	If you do not work for those companies, this does notapply to you.
1123	cc: Subject: Re: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption ApplicaSince I am not an ENA officer, employee, owner, or agent having a power ofattorney or control, I don't understand why I received this request.
1123	From: Mark Taylor 06/21/2000 06:39 PM
1124	Marie, Obviously, you are not "in the know".
1124	The word on the Enron streets is that Yao is brokering the peace in Bosnia, and that is why he is too busy to call his old friends!
1125	Good memo.
1125	I look forward to hearing from you.
1126	I am the person that handles all this.
1126	If you would like to meet to discuss this let me know and we'll set up a time.
1127	Marie, I think you are mistaken.
1127	I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at Cannes.
1127	I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.
1127	I thought, "could it be...might it be...?!".
1127	And it was...it was truly he.
1127	I'm sure of it!
1128	With respect to Utilicorp, I cannot amend their profile yet to open them for financial until I get the word that everything is set up and ready to go.
1128	We do have the financial master in, so as soon as we figure out how we want to open the accounts, I can send my email.
1129	Let me know on MRT what you find out.
1129	When can I see your house?
1130	I am still getting the chill and it's getting really old.
1130	I've tried to enter into the conversations, make a comment or interact, and I just get frozen out.
1130	It's going to be a long walk over there to help her out.
1130	In 2 weeks, I'm all she's got.
1131	Am I supposed to do anything here?
1132	Stephanie rightly pointed out that I was confusing Utilcorp w/Pacific Gas and Electric.
1132	Just call me Roseannaroseannatana!
1132	Attached is the corrected list for 6/20/00 to open Utilicorp for all products except pulp & paper.
1133	Enron's trading policy prohibits employees from trading any products the company trades.
1133	If you have any questions about any specific products pleafeel free to contact me or any of the London legal team.
1133	Mark Schroeder cc: Subject: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption ApplicationI currently do not have any such account.
1133	Would this prohibit me from opening one in the future?
1133	thanks mcs
1134	The Enron trading policy prohibits employees from trading any products thecompany trades.
1134	Please let me know if you are trading any commodities thatEnron trades, otherwise you should be OK.
1134	cc: Subject: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption ApplicationDear Tana I do have trading authorization-limited and full power of attornies-over several futures accounts including my own.
1134	They are all family and friendsaccounts, held with Bear Stearns & Co. Contact person is Alan Pailet 1 61If you have any questions you can reach me at 67695.
1134	Cheers
1135	With respect to the FX, interest rate, S&P and NASDAQ indice trading, as long as your job does not involve trading those products and as long as you do nin your job have access to the trading information (working on the confirmdesk, risk management desk, credit, etc.), you are OK to trade those products.
1135	We do not currently trade agricultural commodities, so you arecurrently not in violation with that product group.
1135	As you may be aware, whave acquired a metals company, so you should also not trade any metals.
1135	cc: Subject: Re: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applicai don't trade any energy or pulp/paper commodities, but i do trade forex,interest rate, s&p and nasdaq indices, and agricultural futures.
1135	hope that helps
1136	Can you email me the registration form?
1136	Thanks!
1137	You're the best!
1138	As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced online.
1138	Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already given to the mirrored product.
1138	Does this strategy work for you, or are there any issues we are unfamiliar with that would require us to review this product in a totally different manner?
1139	What group are they in?
1140	Is Global Finance Gary Hickerson's Group?
1140	Credit is the only group besides us that gets full access, anyone else gets more limited access.
1141	So paraxylene is a petrochem and not a chem?!!
1142	Below is the link that will give you access to the referenced database.
1142	Call me a x33399 if you have any problems.

1143	Mike, Mary Cook is a new attorney that joined our Group yesterday.
1143	Can you get her full access to the referenced database, and let us know when such access is granted.
1143	Thanks!
1144	Per my conversation with Credit, the referenced counterparty has now provided the letter of credit that will enable them to become an eligible swap participant.
1144	Therefore, I am opening them up to trade financial.
1144	They will come through as an amendment on tonight's list.
1145	Per our discussion, attached is my rough draft of the Legal Script.
1145	Just to save you the time and effort of having people read for the part, may I suggest Julia Roberts to play my role in the film.
1145	She's already got this paralegal thing down with the Erin Brokovitch role...
1146	P.S.
1146	I almost have the 6/22 list done.
1146	There is one more counterparty credit/power is working on.
1146	And I have the 6/23 and 6/26 lists done, I just have to write them up.
1146	I'll have them to you soon.
1147	Mike, Can you grant George Hope with the Online Team, view access only to the Legal Online Trading Database.
1147	Can you let us know when his approval comes in. Thanks!
1148	I am still waiting on approval for MRT Energy Marketing Company (and my list from 6/22), pending on your determination as to whether it is a division or a subsidiary of Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
1149	Stacy, Jeff asked me to pass this on to you for handling: Tom Nuelle (pronounced "Nelly"), Risk Manager at BP Amoco called, and said they need to assign a physical trade from one Amoco entity to another.
1149	The trade was done w/Amoco Energy Trading and they need to assign it to Amoco Canada.
1149	It's a Nov-March,EOL Deal no.
1149	265080.
1149	Tom's phone # is 281/366-4034.
1149	Tom Moran from Credit had no problem moving the trade.
1150	I would be glad to send him the link if you can send me the link.
1151	Sara, Laurel was sent the link on 6/1/00, I have no record of a request for Sheila Glover, but I am sending this email to her also.
1151	Link -->
1152	I will need to leave around 3:00 pm tomorrow.
1153	Attached are the referenced lists.
1153	I got that problem worked out on the 6/22 list and will send that to you shortly.
1154	Please shut down the referenced cpy for financial trading.
1154	I just found out they are a Bermuda corporation and I need to see if we can do financial transactions under Bermuda law.
1155	Anytime!
1156	I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware, since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US segment of bandwidth.
1156	Since this is the only segment we are trading online yet, this isn't an issue.
1156	But as we move forward and add more segments we are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based segments as we add them in the future.
1157	Attached is the script revised w/Mark Taylor's comments.
1158	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated June 18, 2000.
1158	Copies will be be sent Dave Samuels and Teresa Smith.
1159	Teresa Smith was my contact on this one.
1160	Please call me with any comments or changes.
1161	Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.
1161	You can see it by clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet where it says "MG New Cpys".
1161	Ignore the first tab.
1161	I am told by London Legal that our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.
1161	Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.
1161	We've got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.
1161	So unless we hear otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties "read only" access.
1162	I just got an updated list.
1162	Please ignore the one I sent you a few minutes ago.
1163	Attached is a copy of the London due diligence on China.
1163	Per my conv.
1163	w/Edmund, it appears China is a "no" for financial transactions.
1164	Thanks for your response.
1164	Yes, I I do need to know two things.
1164	First, the group you are in, and then second, what products you are trading out of the account.
1164	The Enron Trading Policy prohibits employees from trading in any of the products the company trades in. Thanks!
1165	Can you respond?
1166	We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: 05/15/00 Executed Date: 06/09/00 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: Pacific Gas & Electric Company Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE: 1.
1166	DIVISION TRADING.
1166	This counterparty may elect to do additional financial trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its California Gas Transmission Department.
1166	If the Counterparty does elect to trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this master agreement.
1166	No other divisions should be approved for any financial trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from Legal.
1166	However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.
1166	All payments must be treated separately.
1166	It is critical that the PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.
1166	(CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.) 2.
1166	Canadian and US Trades: All financial trades with this counterparty, whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this master agreement.
1166	THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.
1166	3.
1166	GLOBAL CONTRACTS: When we open them up to trade online, we need to make sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement.
1166	Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial product.
1166	3.
1166	ONLINE TRADING: It is critical that the above information is captured correctly before we can open them up for online trading.
1166	I will verbally confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal approves them to trade online.
1167	I say let them eat cake!
1168	How should I respond to soybeans?
1168	It is on the list of commodities we might trade.
1169	At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the referenced master.
1169	Please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Carol at (713) 853-3989 if you have any comments or questions.
1169	If the amendment meets with your approval, please have two copies executed by an authorized officer of J. Aron and return them to me for signature by Enron.
1169	Thanks for your help!
1170	I missed a few of Carol's changes so she asked me to resend the document.
1170	Sorry!
1171	I don't think your attachment was attached.
1172	I just spoke to John Cameron, the lawyer for the Company and our plan is to email him, an associate of his, and Doug Thomas the draft as soon as it is ready.
1172	I will also fax John Cameron the draft.
1172	Tracy Ngo in Credit is working up the credit, and I am doing as much of the draft as I can pending credit.
1172	Carol St. Clair, a lawyer in our Group here in Houston, will be reviewing the draft.
1172	As this is moving quickly, please provide us with any updates of information.
1173	John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.
1173	She is a lawyer working on the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading agreements.

1176	You are so very welcome!
1177	We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.
1177	We found that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.
1177	In the long run we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as the trading markets become more international in nature.
1177	If you prefer the Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to compare the forms and convert the document over.
1177	Please let me know if that is your preference.
1178	I have scheduled taking Monday and Tuesday July 17 & 18 off to visit my family in New York.
1179	I spoke to Serge Martin, their outside counsel, and he said it's on his list, but he hasn't been able to get to it.
1179	Maybe in another month...
1180	We have received the executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated June 28, 2000 wherein Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. ("Assignor") assigned its interest in certain natural gas wholesale and derivatives transactions with Enron North America Corp. to J. Aron & Company ("Assignee").
1180	A copy of the trades being assigned is attached to the assignment which will be distributed to the usual distribution group, plus Bob Klein.
1181	I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading Group.
1181	I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group.
1181	I am responsible for the databases in our group.
1181	During the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses.
1181	First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements Database).
1181	This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, while maintaining the secure legal information.
1181	Second, in response to the online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.
1181	This need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client, the online trading group.
1181	Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database.
1181	His quick turnaround, understanding of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us meet the needs of our clients.
1181	Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team!
1182	In case you were wondering...
1183	I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced counterparty.
1183	I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.
1183	He finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for a lawyer on his side to review it.
1183	He has one comments already I'll run by Mark.
1183	Otherwise, we're waiting for him to get back with his lawyer's comments.
1184	We have received the executed Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 30, 2000.
1184	Copies will be distributed.
1185	Per my conv.
1185	w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.
1185	Per our understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.
1186	Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.
1186	It won't be as painful a process, since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the books.
1186	Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)...
1187	Boy, was she quick.
1187	We appear to have only one trade to assign, so Credit, I guess you are OK with this, and Bob, you don't show any other crude trades do you?
1188	Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in place?
1188	When can we receive copies?
1189	Per Lotus Notes, it looks like Susan Flynn sent them a draft on 5/23 and hasn't heard from them.
1189	The name of the person she sent it to was Adrian
1190	Mark spoke to Bloomberg and their attorney with Wilkie Farr, and they made substantial revisions to the form.
1190	I just faxed a clean and blacklined draft to them and am waiting to get their approval.
1190	Will you be around to sign?
1191	We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with Bloomberg PowerMatch LLC and Bloomberg L.P dated July 6, 2000.
1191	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1192	Anita, You were going to fax me the form of assignment...
1193	Fax no is 713/646-3490.
1194	Can you send him a copy of this.
1194	Thanks.
1195	Jill, We haven't seen credit come through yet.
1195	We can't do anything without it.

1200	Great!
1200	Just a heads up...Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from trading the products that the company trades.
1200	Besides energy commodities(natgas, crude oil products, power), the company also trades interest ratescurrencies, pulp & paper, weather, plastics, and metals.
1200	I am sure they wicontinue to expand this product base in the future.
1200	If you have any questions about what you may or may not trade, please do not hesitate to came at x33399.
1200	cc: Subject: Re: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption ApplicaNONE, at this time....
1201	Robbi, What impact will the advice below have on our Japanese bandwidth approvals?
1201	Right now I have them OK to trade the US segment.
1201	Based on the advice below do you think we will need to get a license as a "telecommunications carrier"?
1201	Should I shut Japan down for now?
1202	We have received the executed amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated June 23, 2000.
1202	Copies will be distributed.
1203	I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the pulp & paper trades to that website.
1203	In oder to determine whether any of the counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper online.
1203	Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?
1203	Thanks!
1204	Re: the Statoil Assignment The Statoil master will not be terminated.
1204	They sold their existing natgas & crude oil book to J. Aron.
1204	They may trade other products out of that master, or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those products.
1204	So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under the J. Aron master.
1204	Everything else should remain the same.
1205	You would need to talk to Mike Moscosco.
1205	I don't know, but perhaps they don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.
1206	Gene, As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project Services Agreement in Enron's files.
1206	I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original agreement is.
1206	How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.?
1207	I am working with the Click Paper.com lawyers on their online documentation, and they want to see a UK form of financial GTC.
1207	Can you send me one?
1207	As ever, in your debt...
1208	Jeff, We are also usually sent a page from some tax book that show the rate of withholding for each of the treaty countries.
1208	Their rate of withholding will impact which form we may or may not need.
1208	Can you send it to me?
1208	Thanks!
1209	The page out of the book we were sent last year says "Treaty Withholding Tax Rates" , and under it is says "The following are US withholding tax rates for dividend, interest and royalty payments from the United States to residents of various treaty countries. Then below there it has a list which shows the Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.
1210	Thanks as usual for the prompt response.
1210	You are a star!
1211	Attached please find the lists referenced above, except the list for 7/6/00.
1211	which just has 1 declined counterparty on it.
1212	Below is a new gas product.
1212	Any issues I need to be aware of?
1213	Can you send me your form(s) of Password Applications?!
1213	Thanks!
1213	I needed to talk to you about MG, because I am really backed up and have not been able to get to that counterparty list.
1213	What is my drop dead date?
1214	Yes, we have an ISDA in place with Georgia Pacific Corporation.
1215	This counterparty came across on my online list for today.
1215	I took a look at the master you have in your office, and to me it seems to be approved for all products, including weather & pulp & paper, just not FX.
1215	In Susan Flynn's email she said no pulp & paper.
1215	Which is correct?
1216	Attached is the referenced amendment.
1216	Please call me or Carol if we can be of further service.
1217	I don't see that I got a response from Leslie on the above list.
1217	Can you check this one too?
1217	Thanks!
1218	I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in is Gladiator.
1218	This is major!
1218	I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of the summer, and probably the year.
1218	How will I know which barbarian is you?
1218	Can we see your face?
1218	Does your horse have special markings so we can tell it's you?
1218	I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!
1218	This is quite exciting.
1218	I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...
1219	I thought that body looked pretty buff!
1219	I should have known it was you.
1219	So you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!
1220	I have been speaking with an ex-associate of yours from Valero and he asked me to pass on his regards to you, Peter Groetzinger.
1220	So, REGARDS from Peter!
1221	Mike, Can you arrange for George Hope to get access to this database ASAP.
1221	Thanks!
1222	Latest drafts:
1223	London Legal called and the referenced US counterparty has come through the London Credit based list, and they need to know if they have a US power marketing license.
1223	Can you let me know?
1223	Thanks!
1224	London Legal wants to know if this is done?
1225	Attached is that RUSH guaranty Stuart Zisman called about.
1225	We need to get it signed today.
1225	We will also need the Certificate with respect to the incumbency of the officer signing the guaranty.
1225	Thanks!
1226	Ted, Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in detail: "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."
1226	Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.
1226	Are there any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that language?
1227	Thanks Genia!
1228	Attached are the descriptions of the physical power business.
1228	Thanks for your help!
1229	One of the online team is looking for someone from Legal who is working with (read "holding up things with") the Allegheny Energy people right now.
1229	Any of you got anything going on?
1230	I already know that!
1231	But none as good looking!
1232	Jealousy, jealousy...!!!
1233	We have received an executed Confidentiality Agreement with RedMeteor.com, Inc. dated July 12, 2000.
1233	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels for the files.
1234	Thanks Kristin!
1235	Thanks!.
1235	I'll fax it back to you after it's signed.
1236	It was good seeing you.
1236	Thanks for dinner.
1236	Shawna and I were waiting for your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!), but I guess we missed you for this trip.
1236	She sends her regards!
1236	I harassed Justy about his movie career.
1236	He told me he was the body double for Russell Crowe.
1236	I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!) Keep me posted on the house.
1236	It looked great!
1237	Is this only available to the Legal Group?
1237	There are a few people in Credit and Global Contracts that might find this helpful.
1237	Please add me to the list.
1237	Thanks!
1238	Did you get this?
1239	Serge, That was sent to you yesterday morning.
1239	I guess you didn't get it?
1240	Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the referenced counterparty for review.
1240	There is no indication of what Enron business person is interested in this counterparty.
1240	I will forward a copy of the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the contact information.
1240	We won't do anything until we receive a credit worksheet from Credit.
1241	None of the counterparties on your Mexico counterparty list should be approved to trade: any financial product, physical bandwidth, and physical power.
1241	When I get back to the office on Wednesday, I will do up your spreadsheets.
1241	Thanks!
1242	Are there any individuals in your group that might find this seminar beneficial?
1243	John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in. I take it that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?
1243	Our usual sample form does not have the governmental provisions.
1243	I would think we would want to send them a sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional provisions in there.
1243	Can you confirm for me that they are a governmental/quasi-governmental?
1243	Also, have you requested credit from Credit?
1244	We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated July 13, 2000.
1244	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels for the files.
1244	Also, attached is an updated list of the Online Confidentiality Agreement for your review.
1244	Please call me at x33399 with any comments or questions.
1245	FYI: Attached is the list of Online Confidentiality Agreements.
1246	Per email below, counterparty would like to put some masters in place with us.
1246	We will need credit before we can proceed.
1247	You're the best!
1248	Please handle.
1248	Thanks!
1249	Deb, Can you check the VP list for Bill.
1249	He was promoted to VP of Enron North America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is not showing up on the list.
1249	Thanks!
1250	In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following information: 1.
1250	The company's full legal name 2.
1250	Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form 3.
1250	What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of transaction is it for) 4.
1250	The company's address, phone number and fax number 5.
1250	Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to talk to them)
1251	Bill, I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.
1251	Maybe you need to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out...
1252	Per our conversation, attached is the Authorized Trader List.
1252	Can you have Gary review it Monday when he gets back, as we are opening a new brokerage account and we need to provide the list to the brokerage firm.
1253	Do you have any updates to the Pulp & Paper group?
1254	Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?
1254	If it's not a rush, it makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like "this is not negotiable!".
1255	Brent Hendry, an attorney that used to be in our group in Houston, then went to Argentina, is now back.
1255	He had review only access to the Master Swap Agreement database.
1255	Can you get him added ASAP with full edit capability.
1255	Thanks!
1256	Scott, Is there someone else in your group who can get Brent access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database?
1257	He has view access, but he doesn't have edit capability, which he needs.
1258	Below is the initial list of the ClickPaper.com counterparties.
1258	As usual, let me know if you have any issues, otherwise I will consider them approved 1 day after transmittal of the list.
1259	We need to set up a new database as soon as possible when you get back.
1259	We have a new online trading system starting Tuesday, ClickPaper.com, and I will need to mirror the Online Trading Database.
1259	Can you call me when you get back.
1260	Attached is the referenced list.
1260	I understand that the Western Area Power Administration - Upper Great Plain has been bugging us to get opened up for physical power, so you might want to give a rush approval on that one.
1261	No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.
1261	You have two on the 7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United States Department of Energy.
1261	Can you please change the name on the accounts.
1261	I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name on to the account.
1261	The people who approve Password Applications should be sorting this out.
1261	Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.
1261	Thanks.
1262	FYI.
1263	Please note that we are in a dispute with Enage Energy US, LP with respect to power trading, and they are shut down for power trading only until such dispute is resolved.
1263	I have already confirmed this with Stephanie.
1264	Thanks Mike!
1265	Attached is a revised draft of the Authorized Trader List.
1265	We need to open a pulp & paper brokerage account today, so we will need to get this signed by the end of the day.
1265	Please let me know if Ted has any comments.
1265	If not, I will get it initialled and bring it to Ted for signature.
1265	I am wating to hear from Sara as to whether we should add agricultural to the list.
1265	Per Gary, the list will be the same exact list as financial.
1265	Thanks!
1266	Mary Cook signed off with a few minor changes.
1266	Attached is the amendment with the revised numbers.
1266	Please check them and let me know if they are OK.
1267	FYI,
1268	We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.
1268	We do have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.
1268	I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).
1268	We will await Credit's instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the documentation.
1269	At the request of Bill Bradford in our Credit Department, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement between HS Resources, Inc. and Enron North America.
1269	Please let me know if the amendment meets with your approval.
1269	My phone number is (713) 853-3399.
1269	Sr. Legal Specialist
1270	Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look these dates up?
1271	It is in my "forms" subdirectory, called "questionnaire-umbrella re internet
1272	Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.
1272	From the US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for power.
1272	I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.
1273	Gosh, I'm getting so good at this I might not need you anymore...did I not see that one coming or what!
1274	Jeff, Would you handle this or would Alan, or both of you?
1275	Below is John's contact as Boeing.
1275	He would like to get some credit so we can get this counterparty an ISDA.
1275	I understand that you are under the gun today, if you could just let us know when we might be able to get some credit.
1275	Much thanks!
1276	Mark, I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who your attorney should be on this deal.
1276	I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, and left him a message to which he finally responded.
1276	He is now expecting to see this CA.
1276	I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.
1276	I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your direction as to how I should handle this.
1276	I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone number is 713/853-3399.
1277	I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list Credit sent me).
1277	One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical power.
1277	Like the other European based physical power products, it should not be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a particular one).
1277	Is that OK with you.
1277	Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit opened them up for all financial power).
1277	I had already opened them up for all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval.
1278	Attached is the referenced list.
1278	There are only 2 counterparties for approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.
1278	Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add financial power.
1278	I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products with utilities under Virginia law.
1278	Notes in our database reflect that this was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.
1278	I have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to resolve this directly with them.
1278	Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas Company, and that needs to be made part of the name.
1279	Alan & Harry Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the two of you their spreadsheets.
1279	However, it appears the physical side of the business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you the list.
1279	It's up to you.
1279	Let me know.
1280	Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp.
1280	was originally shut down for financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.
1280	Since then, we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental utilities.
1280	Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp.
1280	(and moved the Aquila trades under it).
1280	Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp.
1280	for all financial products.
1281	The referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical and financial products offered online.
1281	I am not sure if we need to see this counterparty come through again as a Click Paper counterparty or not.
1281	I'll let Tom decide.
1281	For me, I'm OK.
1282	David, A clarification...
1282	On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.
1282	You say that they should only trade Australian power and weather.
1282	How about all the other products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?
1282	I am taking it literally and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.
1282	Is that a correct interpretation?
1283	It is OK to sign the copy I emailed to you.
1283	Just return the signed copy to me via fax 713/646-3490 and I will get is signed by an authorized officer here and return it to you.
1283	In your fax please tell me who you would like me to send the return fax to.
1283	Thanks for your prompt attention with this!
1284	I have already responded to the counterparty.
1285	Done at last!
1285	Whew, I'm whooped!
1285	Now it's your turn to have fun!
1285	Unfortunatel, I have a call into David Minns about one issue, and I hope when he responds it doesn't change my approvals...
1286	Per our conversation last night, can you take a look at my list of country product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the information.
1286	Thanks.
1287	Leslie, On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.
1287	I have no record on PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even though it says amended.
1287	Thanks.
1288	Attached is the referenced list.
1288	I am still waiting on 1 response for the list from the 24th.
1289	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 7/26/00.
1289	Copies will be sent to Andy Zipper and a copy to Dave Samuels for the files.
1290	Mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a Confidentiality Agreement for the Houston Chronicle.
1290	What's the scoop there?
1291	Attached is the referenced list.
1291	The Bakersfield California is approved to only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.
1291	Therefore, I have turned them down to trade the current products we have available online.
1291	As our product base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.
1292	The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions."
1292	In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types of products they are approved to do with us.
1293	Anthony, I have no idea what that questions means...
1294	Attached please find Deemed ISDA.
1295	Holly, Attached is a sample incumbency certificate.
1296	At the request of Sara Shackleton, attached is our form of Letter of Credit.
1297	Holly, Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine.
1297	Frequently, companies do not know who will be available to sign, so they list more than one signer.
1298	We have received and executed Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: April 28, 2000 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp. Counterparty: Kinder Morgan, Inc. Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp & Paper Foreign Exchange
1299	Holly, I already mailed the documents out to meet the Fedex deadline.
1299	Can you substitute these pages out later, or hand write the changes?
1300	Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.
1300	It appears Frank was on this initial email.
1300	I don't know what progress, if any, has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.
1300	The person that contacted us is on the bottom of this email.
1300	I will wait to see this counterparty come through on the Credit list.
1300	P.S.
1300	We do have a financial master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict metals trading.
1301	Mr. Faragalla, I am checking on your review of the Confdientiality Agreement referenced in our earlier email below.
1301	When might we expect to hear some comments from you?
1301	Please let me know.
1302	Mr. Finzi, We have heard back from you regarding the Confidentiality Agreement referenced below.
1302	Can you please let me know when we might expect your comments?
1302	Thank you.
1303	As a follow-up to my memo re: tax treaty countries, I called Jeff Blumenthal about Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania & Venezuela, since they were not on the list and in a separate memo, and he said that they adopted tax treaties after the Tax Code binder was published.
1304	I take it by PG&E Core, you mean PG&E's Core Procurement Department.
1304	Yes, it should go out under the master
1305	I need to hear back from anyone whose group may be trading with this counterparty.
1305	Here's my issue.
1305	We have been negotiating an amendment to the Password Application with this counterparty.
1305	The absolutely refuse to see a GTC.
1305	I don't know if any of you are trading gas, crude or power with them, but if you are, do you have a master, or would the counterparty see a GTC.
1305	I'm trying to figure out what we have before we talk to them.
1305	Thanks!
1306	We have this down for signature right now.
1306	We hope to get it out today.
1307	Yeah, it won't go away!
1308	We have received comments from the referenced counterparty with respect to comments to an Annex A to a Confirmation.
1308	Mary Cook, a new attorney in our Group, will be working on this.
1309	Remember, on the divisions, to make the incorporated entity name part of the counterparty's name!
1310	No.
1311	Getting back to the original questions.
1311	Do you trade with this counterparty and do you trade pursuant to a master or a GTC?
1312	Have you heard from The Houston Chronicle?
1313	Do you want me to follow up with them?
1314	Is there someone in our group that is working on this.
1314	I looked in Lotus Notes and didn't find any entry for this.
1315	Is someone from our group working on this?
1316	John, Mark left a message for you yesterday.
1316	He needs to discuss this comment with you.
1316	Can you please call him.
1316	Thanks!
1317	Dave, Leslie Hansen is going to review your NDA.
1317	Her number is x36121.
1318	Carol, Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.
1318	It is not clear to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK.
1318	It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.
1318	What do I need to do here?
1318	Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some hand marked changes.
1318	Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should sign?
1318	Hope all is going well...
1319	With respect to your inquiry as to whether there was any assignment executed with respect to the assignment of the Howard trades to TXU, I looked in the file and it appears that Susan Bailey in our Group prepared an Assignment and Termination Agreement which she passed on the Brant Reves in Credit on 1/6/00 for handling.
1319	There is no record of this assignment ever being executed in our records.
1320	Brenda, I am forwarding this email to you, because attached to the bottom is a presentation that Mark wants to copy to put slides in his presentation.
1321	Do you have a master agreement in place with Pacific Gas & Electric if you trade with them, or do you trade under GTC's?
1322	Who at the West Desk should I speak to?
1322	We don't usually talk with the physical traders.
1323	Stephanie, Can you provide Travis, the ClickPaper lawyer, with a copy of the Japanese ETA?
1324	Please fax the signed agreement to 713/646-3490.
1324	If you have any questions call me at 713/853-3399.
1324	Thanks.
1324	"George Emerson" Please respond to gemerson
1325	I looked thru the attached 10K for NSTAR and could find no "NSTAR Companies" entity listed there.
1325	Maybe you'll have better luck, or are smarter and will find it (since I failed so miserably on you know what today!).
1326	Attached please find the referenced lists.
1326	Please note: 7/31/00 List - I am not opening up Equitable Gas Company, because it does not say a division of Equitable Resources Inc. I thought that was our deal.
1326	8/1/00 List- I cannot review NSTAR Companies yet.
1326	There is some question as to whether that is a correct legal entity.
1327	Anyone know anything about this?
1328	All's I need now is your email w/instructions.
1329	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with Spear, Leeds & Kellogg dated July 31, 2000.
1329	A copy will be sent to John Pavetto and to Dave Samuels for the files.
1330	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 04/18/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1330	Copies will be distributed.
1331	I will redo the 7/31/00 list with the Equitable approval.
1332	Credit wants to open up the referenced counterparty immediately.
1332	They are approved to trade all physical products, except physical power, and can trade all financial.
1332	I will follow up with this counterparty profile on today's approvals.
1333	Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July.
1333	Please let me know if the changes meet with your approval.
1334	Sure.
1334	Maybe after running we could get cleaned up and go take a look.
1334	Do you still want to go to the movies?
1335	Today after work would be fine if you want to?!
1336	Attached is the referenced amendment.
1336	Let me know if it meets with your approval.
1336	Make sure you check my numbers.
1337	I've got several European counterparties on my 8/3/00 ClickPaper Online List, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and France.
1337	Are there any restrictions on trading financial pulp & paper in Europe?
1337	Everything going well...?
1338	Bob, John Viverito, an attorney from Houston who is temporarily in Japan setting up our Japanese trading office, is looking for the templates for confirmations for US weather and pulp and paper confirmations.
1338	Can you send the confirmations to him.
1338	Thanks!
1339	Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up with the online team for some reason.
1340	Just an heads up, they are open to trade physical power, which I expect is what they want to trade, but not financial.
1341	Yes, the only weather representations we need are now always covered in the confirmation.
1341	As far as thru what entity they trade, I support whatever Lotus Notes says.
1342	Dave, This should do it...
1343	Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.
1343	So if they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.
1344	We have a new paralegal starting in our group today, Stephanie Panus.
1344	Can you get her full access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
1344	Thanks!
1345	Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.
1345	Are we supposed to have that weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?
1346	Below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes.
1346	Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving).
1346	Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need to know where they are located.
1346	Justin Boyd, London Edmund Cooper, London Mark Elliott, London Paul Simons, London Peter Keohane, Calgary Martin Rosell, Oslo Matthis Lee, Singapore David Minns, Australia John Viverito, Japan
1347	I thought this was what we were already doing.
1347	Sara, Mark, wasn't that your understanding?
1348	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated as of August 1, 2000.
1348	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels for the files.
1349	Can you handle this?
1350	And here I thought you were inviting me to a barbecue!
1351	Thanks Edmund.
1351	You're the best!
1352	Attached is the referenced list.
1352	Please note the following: James Hardie N.V. is a Netherlands counterparty.
1352	They can enter into swap transactions only, no options.
1352	As we expand the product list, we will have to note this.
1352	Societe Industrielle de Transports Automobile: I have them shut down for now until I speak to the London office tomorrow about bankruptcy/setoff issues in France.
1353	What do you mean "Happy Hour"?!
1353	How can we be happy when we're losing our Erica!!
1354	I looked in the Lotus Notes database, and I didn't see anything about this.
1354	Unless Susan is working on this, I know nothing...
1355	The Assignment and Amendment to the Assignment was faxed to Vangie McGilloway and the orginals are being fedexed to her tonight.
1355	A copy is being sent to Tracy.
1356	We have received the executed Second Amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of July 31, 2000.
1356	This amendment changes the Counterparty's exposure Threshold and exempts certain Transactions when calculating "Exposure" under Paragraph 3 of the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
1356	Copies will be distributed.
1357	What is this attached list?
1357	Have I seen it before?
1358	Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties.
1358	Whew...!!!
1358	As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.
1358	I have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and paper approvals until late this week/early next week.
1358	After reviewing thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling people without my systems in place!
1359	With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into newsprint swaps and options only.
1359	At this time our list does not reflect the individual products you are trading.
1359	I understand from Mark Taylor that he spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as this one will occur from time to time.
1360	At Mark Taylor's direction, I have revised the Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement form to add a new Paragraph 2 with respect to keeping the discussions confidential.
1360	A copy is attached for your files.
1361	Attached are the referenced lists.
1361	A few things to note: On the 8/7/00 List: Papier Masson, LTEE can transact all pulp and papers swaps, but not options (when we have them).
1361	On the 8/8/00 List: Globe Building Materials, Inc. has been shut down from trading financial since they are currently not an eligible swap participant ("ESP") in their own right.
1361	However, getting a letter of credit in place would make them an ESP, and Credit has requested a letter of credit from them.
1361	As soon as they receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for
1362	On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new counterparty.
1362	On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read: City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
1362	the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.
1363	I just wanted to confirm that your records show the referenced counterparty closed for power...?
1364	With the forms relocation, forms list.doc needs to be revised to reflect their new location.
1365	I have gotten a phone call from Hydro-Quebec checking on the status of this.
1365	Can we expect a credit worksheet for an ISDA comparison?
1366	In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.
1366	The City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are the City of Huntsville, AL.
1366	This isn't going to be a problem with my financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.
1366	The same would apply to counties.
1366	So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of the counterparty name.
1366	Leslie, do you have any problem w/Huntsville, let me know?
1367	Attached is the referenced list.
1367	Please see the change for power on Turlock.
1367	I will be out of the office Friday and Monday.
1368	Just a followup, Stephanie needs full access ASAP.
1368	Can you let her know when her access is granted.
1368	Thanks!
1369	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated July 27, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1369	Copies will be distributed.
1370	I have redone the attached list to open up Equitable for everything but physical power.
1371	No, the City of Huntsville is not approved for financial trading or physical power.
1371	FYI< with the US based customer list (online and offline), we will never approve a governmental entity for financial trading unless we have a master in place, or time to do some due diligence on their authority to enter into financial transactions.
1372	I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).
1372	With such an increase in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!
1372	The White House may become an option...
1373	I just got in from Aspen.
1373	This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's birthday.
1373	Is Holly going, she might like to...?
1373	In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.
1373	It seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to be careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...
1373	As far as not hearing back from Enron.
1373	I wouldn't think anything of it.
1373	They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from them for two months.
1373	Big companies have lots of layers to get anything done.
1373	Just keep plugging on...
1374	I should have realized Anthony was bucking for the Chairman's Award!
1374	If I had known that...!!!
1375	Heard anything on that amendment to the ISDA?
1376	Thanks!
1377	Holly would be a good one to invite.
1377	She and Carol are real good friends.
1377	Lucinda really doesn't know Carol all that well, so I think I'd skip her.
1377	Holly's work # is (281) 364-5207.
1378	No response yet.
1378	I have a call into Credit to discuss what entities we want to trade with.
1379	We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of July 5, 2000.
1379	This amendment changes the Material Adverse Change Clause in the Agreement.
1379	Copies will be distributed.
1380	FYI, executed master distribution list.
1381	We have received the following executed documents: Consent to Assignment dated as of June 12, 2000 between Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. ("MEGA") and ENA, wherein MEGA assigned to Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. its interest in certain financial transactions it had entered into with ENA; and Amendment to Consent to Assignment dated as of June 13, 2000 wherein MEGA, ENA and Morgan Stanley agreed that the Transactions assigned in the above Agreement will be governed by the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Morgan Stanley.
1381	Copies will be distributed.
1382	Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do power).
1382	David, when I talk about this I am never including credit derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that this is a credit derivatives counterparty.
1383	When you say they are approved, do you mean they are approved for all products, or just Australian products?
1384	Unbeknownst to me, it had been returned to me and was buried under stacks of papers on my desk.
1384	I'll get it out today.
1385	1.
1385	What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?
1385	I think that should be "Credit Derivatives".
1385	2.
1385	Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list, since I never have any responses from those groups.
1385	3.
1385	I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.
1385	4.
1385	Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for "EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".
1385	I will maintain my approvals for each of those separate online trading databases in the same database.
1385	5.
1385	I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".
1385	Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush from last week done....
1385	As usual, your help is always appreciated!
1386	Nella Cappalleto has early retired from the Calgary office.
1386	In your distribution memos for signed documents, copies of Canadian agreements were previously sent to Nella.
1386	Please send them to Peter Keohane's new assistant, Sharon Crawford.
1387	Do you know who is this fellow and why is he sending me a list?
1388	Mike, Checking on the status of getting Stephanie Panus, a new paralegal in our Group, full edit access to the referenced database.
1388	Also, we need to get some additional people full edit access: Matt Dawson, who just started in London Legal, and David Minns, a lawyer in our Australia office.
1388	Can you let me and each of these people know when they have access.
1388	Thanks!
1389	Camille, you're not waiting on anything from me to resolve the "Bakersfield Californian Issue", are you?
1390	With respect to the attached list, a few things: 1.
1390	With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are approved for all products (including financial & power).
1390	Can you let me know if your approvals reflect otherwise?
1390	2.
1390	With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company: Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".
1390	We have just received the executed ISDA Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set the master up.
1390	Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading arm, so that entity name should be left alone.
1390	I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from Australia about a question.
1391	Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?
1391	For online, what I daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading legal groups.
1391	Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's list.
1391	I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties.
1391	Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).
1391	I understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process may get more complex.
1391	Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you?
1392	Can you put this on my calendar.
1392	Thanks.
1393	Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's ability to trade its products.
1393	So far the only physical trading area where a governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained to trade power.
1393	For financial trading we do have to inquire into the relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative transactions.
1393	In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring outside counsel to advise us.
1393	For most governmental entities if we do not have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will not be approving them to trade financial products.
1393	As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US eligible swap participant standards.
1393	As I'm sure you know, for most plain vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm or a net worth of $1mm.
1393	Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.
1393	If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet this test.
1393	At your direction I will handle this in this manner.
1393	How would you like me to proceed?
1394	Justin, I approved Powercor to trade before I left last night.
1394	By copy of this email to our online team here, I will be notifying them of your concern that this counterparty is opened to trade when you arrive at work today in Australia.
1395	John, Here is the list from yesterday.
1395	On a going forward basis I will just add you to my distribution, and there will usually be no message from me unless we have a RUSH approval or some other info I need to communicate.
1396	The online team called and they would like a rush approval for Duke Energy Merchants LLC.
1396	In particular, this counterparty would like to trade European physical coal.
1396	Please let me know as soon as possible whether you have any problems with this counterparty.
1397	No problema!
1398	David, Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted into our Financial Trading Database.
1398	This databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed.
1398	London currently updates this database to manage its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system.
1398	This database serves a number of purposes.
1398	First, it is our core memory of contract negotiations.
1398	Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue.
1398	It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts.
1398	For instance, it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before.
1398	We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front.
1398	In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.
1398	Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.
1398	For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place.
1398	Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading.
1398	For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our Clients, whether traders or back office support people.
1398	Employees outside legal have limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential Legal and Credit comments.
1398	They have no edit capabilities.
1398	The database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have found helpful.
1398	You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you.
1398	It usually takes a few days.
1398	Once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..
1398	Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?
1398	That would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you.
1399	I heard back from the coal lawyers.
1399	Duke is approved to trade all coal.
1400	Mark Taylor just heard that Edmund is very sick and has been out for quite awhile.
1400	What's the scoop?
1400	Is he in the hospital, will he continue to be out, is there someplace we can send flowers?
1400	Can you let me know what's going on.
1400	Thanks!
1401	Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather online.
1401	However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only covers energy commodities.
1401	I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the master agreement.
1401	I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.
1401	So, they are OK to open for weather.
1402	Can you please have the Password Application amended to set up the counterparty as I have indicated.
1402	Then tell Global Contracts it is done.
1403	Per Leslie Hansen, the name above is the way the Town of Braintree, Massachusetts is setting up their power contract, so this is the way we should open them up for EOL.
1404	I have already responded in my initial email.
1404	For whatever reason, the counterparty trades physical gas as "Nicor Gas Company".
1404	They trade financial as indicated below.
1404	It is now up to EOL to get back with the counterparty and get them to amend the Password Applcation.
1405	We have received the First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of July 1, 2000 ("Amendment").
1405	This Amendment (1) amends Counterparty's Threshold under the Credit Suport Annex, (2) exempts certain Transactions when determining "Exposure" under the ISDA Master Agreement, and (3) changes the Fixed Price with respect to the "Exempt Transactions" reflected in the Amendment.
1405	Copies will be distributed.
1406	There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading with these entities.
1406	We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.
1406	This is a new master.
1406	If the counterparty is not set up this way it need to be.
1406	Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.
1406	There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.
1406	The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.
1406	Frank Davis will resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.
1406	When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.
1406	Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.
1406	I am confused too.
1407	I approved this counterparty with US EOL this morning to trade all coal including European coal.
1408	Edmund, I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.
1408	I had no idea.
1408	What's the scoop?
1408	Should I be worried?
1409	Per the email below, it appears to me physical gas should be traded only under Nicor Gas Company and financial through the dba.
1409	Do you agree?
1410	I had a hernia two years ago.
1410	It's not fun.
1410	Mine didn't sound as bad as your does, though.
1410	You haven't been having a good year.
1410	I hope things improve.
1411	It is not clear to me what Braintree's should remain open.
1411	Will we shut down this Town of Braintree and only keep open Braintree Electric Light Department?
1412	Is this OK with you for yur financial agreement?
1413	Doug, I'm passing this on to Mark Taylor for review.
1414	In addition to granting full edit access to David Minns in our Australia office, he has also required that Alison Keogh and Rob McGrory in his office be granted access.
1414	Can you let them know when they have full edit capability.
1414	Thanks
1415	I think if once you get full access you could have your assistant plug in the required data for on each ISDA Master in place or draft you have out to counterparties.
1415	When you come here I would like to spend just a little time going over some of the data and the reporting funtions.
1415	I am going to open an Enron counterparty called short name "Enron Australia" and that should be the code name you should use.
1415	Please do not change the entries on any of the Houston or London based counterparties.
1416	All my students are doing so well!
1416	I'm just so proud (sniff, sniff..)!
1416	cc: Subject: Organisational Announcement Interesting.
1417	He's a bum!
1418	Per our conversation, I am attaching a proposed form of Unanimous Consent of the Board of Directors of Brant-Allen Industries, Inc. ("Company") that would expand the Consent of Directors given to us when we executed the ISDA Master Agreement in 1998 to do more than just the single trade referenced in that resolution.
1418	If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have it executed by the directors of the Company and return a copy to me for our files.
1418	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) In addition, can you confirm one thing for me.
1418	There is a note in our file that says documents for the Company require two signatures.
1418	I looked at the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws you provided us and find no such signatory requirement.
1418	Is this note an error?
1419	FYI!
1420	I left a message for both Molly and Brad Diebner and neither has returned my calls.
1421	Per your request...
1422	I am taking Wedneday p.m.
1422	off to deal with furniture deliveries.
1423	Do you know what to do here?
1424	Per, Did the link work?
1424	If you would like me to go over the information in the database with you give me a call at x33399.
1425	Call me at 853-3399 if you have any questions.
1426	Is this forever, or just for the week?
1427	Should I take David off?
1428	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated July 31, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1428	Copies will be distributed.
1429	At Sara's request, attached is a draft of the blackline of the referenced master.
1430	Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company after receiving these emails.
1430	They faxed to her a copy of the assumed name certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under the name Nicor Gas Company.
1430	Per her conversations they have not changed their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas Company.
1430	Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.
1430	Per my conversation with Stacy Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.
1430	I will have a copy of the assumed name certificate walked down to Adnan.
1430	If we are all in agreement after this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".
1430	Upon receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I will contact Credit and the Online team.
1431	Attached is a picture of baby Davies.
1431	What a cutie!
1432	He is absolutely adorable.
1432	What a sweet smile!
1433	Leslie, Theresa Mandola with EOL called and the referenced counterparty called her and is already trading gas with us and would like to start trading power online.
1433	I looked in my database and we have them shut down for power.
1433	Is this a counterparty we could open up for power or not?
1434	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching a clean and blacklined draft of the Schedule and Credit Support Annex to the referenced ISDA Master Agreement.
1434	Can you please provide or confirm the following information: (1) since the Counterparty is Australian, I have added the Counterparty's ACN Number to the document.
1434	Can you please provide that number to us.
1434	(2) Can you take a look at the definition of "Obligors" in the Credit Support Annex and let us know if it references the correct Obligors under the Loan Agreement.
1434	Since I will not be in the office this afternoon, can you please call Sara at (713) 853-5620 or Stephanie Panus at (713) 345-3249 with your comments.
1434	Thanks for your attention herewith.
1435	Per my conversation with Leslie, it is OK to open this counterparty for all US physical power.
1436	You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.
1436	They would continue to be offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they would be offered also by Enron North America.
1436	Do you see any legal issues from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by Enron North America too?
1437	I can't say it enough...you are the best!
1438	Here is that "Umbrella" guaranty we were talking about.
1438	Why don't you print it out and then let's go over the changes that need to be made...
1439	Did you get the email of the documents I sent you, soon after we spoke?
1440	Shari, To save you some time in the future, if a counterparty says "declined" on the worksheet, you don't even have to look at it at all, because it means Credit has decided not to trade with them.
1441	I am forwarding a copy of Leslie's email, as a sample for you.
1441	I input Leslie's responses in my EOL Legal Database, so I can keep track, product by product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date.
1441	If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is changing an earlier approval.
1441	Further, I put Leslie's notes about any particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online GTC", or whatever.
1441	Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing.
1442	I need a quick reply on a ClickPaper counterparty below.
1442	If I do not hear from you I will take it that it is OK.
1443	This counterparty looks OK to trade all products right now.
1443	We have the ISDA master out for signature.
1444	In connection with the confirm I sent you earlier, I am also attaching a form of fax letter for transmittal of the confirm to the Counterparty.
1445	Attached please find Deemed ISDA Confirmation and Form of Transmittal Fax to Counterparty.
1446	It's time for our regular Friday evening email chat!
1446	Hope your doing well.
1446	What's the scoop on your surgery?
1446	I've got a few new products showing up on my list, originating from your neck of the woods.
1446	Specifically, we've got MG metals out of Rotterday and Japan.
1446	Are there any legal issues for my Houston based customer list, or are they OK for everybody?
1447	There is no list for 8/21/00, since the only counterparty was a decline.
1447	I've got two metals products shut down on the above lists until I hear back from London.
1448	I just got a phone call from Mike Garred, a commodity trader for New Power Company.
1448	He said they were some Enron 50/50 JV.
1448	Whatever he needs to trade with us, LC or whatever, he's rearing to go ASAP.
1448	He is wondering where his application is in the online process.
1448	He is very eager to trade power & gas.
1448	His phone no.
1448	is 853-3399.
1448	He said his email says he's not in, but leave him a message he's checking them regularly.
1448	His Credit person is Steve Nolan, located in Connecticut at 203/531-0400.
1449	Per our discussion, I am attaching a sample form of ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.
1449	They, of course, should be sent to the Counterparty with the ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex attached.
1450	That job I passed on your resume to in our group, I checked, and they still haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation dropping her daughter off at college.
1451	The wine tasting sounds great!
1451	I haven't been to one in awhile.
1451	It's always good to see Hollis too.
1451	Keep me posted...
1452	There's a reason why you earned the title of "Favorite Credit Person (after Bill)"...!
1453	Don't you remember at Sara's party, we were talking to Bill, and telling him how you were our favorite Credit person, and he said, "but I thought I was your favorite Credit person...", and since he is your boss, it seems quite political (for both you and me!) that he is always #1, anyway...a girl's always got to hedge her bets...!!
1454	It was really good talking to you the other day.
1454	You've been on my mind for a while.
1454	I hope you can come visit!
1455	I can't believe a girl wouldn't call you back after a date...
1456	You crack me up!
1457	Even though it is pretty frequent that this does happen (1 out of 25 masters) I think it would be fine to add this into Library.doc.
1457	I am working on a revised draft that I hope to distribute to the group, so if you have anything else you want entered, forward it on to me.
1458	I do not appear to have it.
1459	Oh guru of all things Canadian...
1459	I'm working on comments to an ISDA that Hydro-Quebec sent us for an affiliate, HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., which is a Delaware corporation.
1459	Is there anything special about Hydro-Quebec being the Guarantor, or just the usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor?
1459	By the way, I hope you're coming up for the Legal Conference.
1459	There are many problems at Enron that need our help in getting sorted out, those kinds of problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out!
1459	I'm counting on you!
1460	I'll go for that picking up the cigarettes off the floor thing, it seemed somewhat unsanitary anyway.
1460	But if you get so wimpy that you can't survive a drink or two with your buddy down south of the border (female at that!)...well, we need to toughen you up man!
1460	Repeat after me: "PARTY, PARTY, PARTY!!!"
1461	John, no we do not have an ISDA in place with Wah Chang.
1461	Do you want me to pass your request on to Credit?
1462	My assignment related only to financial transactions.
1462	So it would not be power deals.
1463	The list of trades was attached to the assignment.
1463	Jeff Sorenson should have a copy down there.
1464	Can you provide Melissa with a copy of the recent assignment we entered into.
1464	I think it should already be in the blue file.
1464	Thanks.
1465	We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you.
1465	And the guarantees (when we get them) should work for allfinancial transactions.
1466	Melissa, We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.
1466	Is that our standard convention?
1466	Thanks for your help!
1466	P.S.
1466	I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my assistant Taffy Milligan.
1466	She can get you copies of any documents in the future.
1467	We've got a draft master with the following rounding conventions: Short tons: zero decimals Temperatures: zero decimals US Dollar Amounts: to the nearest cent Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions?
1467	P.S.
1467	Do you get a invite to our favorite email person's political
1468	I've been trying to get Clickpaper to expand their product approval list to match the products they offer...maybe your request will help!
1469	Thanks for your help anyway.
1469	I'll just cross out kilowatts, they already had megawatts in there.
1470	I live to corrupt young, unsuspecting lawyers...
1471	I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.
1471	When you send your approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian products only, or all products.
1471	Thanks!
1472	Are they approval for ALL products, or only Australian products?
1473	I just had this conv.
1473	w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online.
1473	What I am being told is that the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online trading.
1473	It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships.
1473	The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency relationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some specific documentation that she got signed.
1473	But I am told should not be entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than principals, except under extraordinary circumstances.
1474	It looks like you will need to get whatever documentation Leslie had sign for those in place with these.
1474	I know she has this problem with the service companies to the utilities.
1475	Attached is a revision to the list I just sent you, revised to reflect that the last two Australian counterparties can only trade the Australian products Credit listed.
1476	Can you fix this on my calendar?
1476	Thanks!
1477	Just a heads up: I am sending up an ISDA Master tonight between ECC and Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership for signature of a Canadian officer.
1477	Yours ever,
1478	I have an eye dr.
1478	appt.
1478	tomorrow at 3:00.
1478	I'll have to leave a little early.
1479	Attached please find the referenced Annex B and copy of transmittal fax.
1480	At Mark Taylor's request, I am attaching Leslie Hansen's form of override letter when a GTC will "override" the master agreement for online transactions.
1480	How are you doing Justy?
1481	Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so they can start trading when she's out.
1481	She seems to feel the way the ETA is written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use caused by their fault or negligence.
1481	Can you call her at 215/684-6630.
1481	Thanks.
1482	Camille Gerard.
1483	Per the emails below, it appears you are looking for the Legal and Privacy Statement.
1483	Mark T. said Leslie just revised it for the online team.
1483	Leslie is on vacation until the 9th, but I think attached below may be the latest draft.
1483	It is located in her "Online" subdirectory, under "Phase 2".
1484	Rhonda, Can you provide me with the Agency Agreement or other documentation you may have received with respect to this agency relationship.
1484	Thanks!
1485	With respect to the referenced List: 1.
1485	Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's direction 2.
1485	Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.
1485	If they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to contact them & get evidence of their FERC license.
1485	3.
1485	Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate more this agency thing.
1485	It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we just need more info.
1486	I must have missed your promotion.
1486	Congratulations!
1486	Atttached is the certificate so you do not have to retype it.
1487	Where are y'll moving to?
1488	I originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power.
1488	Are we sure it is not a FERC approved marketer?
1489	On the attached list, Alliant Energy Corporation is coming back thru to be opened for East power, and the power lawyers are telling me they don't have a FERC license.
1489	If they really want to trade power I will need a name and phone number so our power lawyers can talk to them.
1490	Then, I'll stick with what I told the EOL team.
1490	If they really want to trade power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why they think they can trade power.
1490	Otherwise, it stays as a "no".
1491	Just a head's up.
1491	Dave finally got the amendment to the ETA signed, so I am fedexing it out to the counterparty today.
1492	Per my conv.
1492	w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph: POWER: It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power contracts. She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover firm and non-firm power. Also, she was wondering whether we trade power transmission (I had no idea, silly me). Further, even if we have a master in place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or under a GTC. My records show they have come thru before through EOL and Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). EMISSIONS: They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in place with us. I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions). MASTER USER CHANGE: She already has a password set up with us and would like to change the master user.
1493	When you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the file.
1493	Thanks.
1494	I keep trying to email them, but it won't go thru.
1494	Maybe this time...
1495	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/2/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1495	Copies will be distributed.
1496	With respect to Ameren Services Company, my notes say I originally had them for power buys ONLY, so I just want to make sure that my "amended-no change" still reads power the same way.
1497	Bill Bradford called this morning and wants to put Duetsche Bank on the front burner.
1497	He has been speaking to them and wants to set up a conference call later this week to resolve the remaining issues.
1497	It appears that Carol was working on this master.
1497	Bill wants to know what lawyer will be picking this up, hopefully sometime this morning, so he can set up the conference call.
1497	If you let me know who can work on it I'll track down the file for you...
1498	The icon below should get you in to the database.
1499	Thanks Scott!
1500	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 4, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1500	Copies will be distributed.
1501	Shari, I've got them shut down for power.
1501	They were one of the counterparty's on the initial approval lists.
1501	The online team tells me we are trading power with them off line, so what's the scoop?
1501	Can they trade power?
1502	Travis, The lastest trading/online memo is in my subdirectory,
1503	Are you shutting down their trading today?
1504	I am going to have to leave a skooch early on Friday, at 4 pm.
1505	I looked in our financial agreement database and ECTRIC does not have a master in place with either of those entities.
1505	London Legal sent a draft to Credit Lyonnais in March of 1999, but there appears to be no activity under that master.
1505	Credit Lyonnais has a master styled "Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) with Enron North America, under which we trade interest rate, currencies & equities, and Toronto Dominion has master in place with Enron North America and one with Enron Gas and Petrochemicals Trading Limited, an English corp., and a subsidiary of ECTRIC (however, I do not have a copy and do not know if this is a limited purpose master or not), but nothing for either of these entities under ECTRIC. I hope this is helpful. Let me know if I can be of further service
1506	I knew it was Canadian and started with a "T".
1506	Am I good or what!?!
1506	When you get to be my age you'll have no memory left.
1506	Sure wish you were down here enjoying these 109+ degree days with us.
1506	It'll make you appreciate Calgary in Winter.
1507	I just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you.
1507	My usual source for getting the ETA's is out, and I'm trying to track down someone else who can send them to me...
1508	Any updates on Louisville Gas & Electric and LCRA?
1509	Can I attend?
1510	Have you heard anything back from Gas Natural with respect to getting their signed guarantees on the Comercializadora Metrogas and Gas Natural Mexico trades?
1510	I've been holding my Enron Guarantees as leverage in getting theirs.
1510	We are at the period in the confirms where we need to exchange guarantees...
1511	When you get back in we need to talk about this cpy.
1511	My records had them shut down for power, they called about contract issue and wanting to trade in all products areas, and speaking to Shari and checking your notes, you had them as open.
1511	Since they haven't traded power yet, I had Frank shut them down until I confirm with you they're OK and under what contracts.
1511	Talk to you when you get back...
1512	Tana Jones -XL
1513	FYI
1514	John, Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.
1514	Re: sample master agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to send out sample masters.
1514	What appears to be happening is that a customer gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being incredibly longer once credit is added.
1514	If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?
1514	Let me know your thinking...
1515	I just got another call from Sandy Steffen, and she would like, if possible, to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups, so they can be set up to trade by tomorrow.
1515	She also expressed an interest espectially today in NATURAL GAS.
1515	After talking to her can you let me know under what contract and/or limitations they can trade.
1515	Thanks It appears she has only heard back from the online team
1516	Taffy, I just spoke to Marie and she needs a set.
1516	Also, take Susan Flynn and Jason Peters off your distribution.
1517	Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the counterparty.
1517	Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.
1517	Any non-master trades would go under the respective GTC.
1517	It appears to be only a coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have masters in place with.
1518	Where did Souad go?
1519	The 12 month restriction isn't coming from Legal, it's coming from Credit.
1519	You need to contact Tom Moran.
1520	I checked the Corporate Database and it's not listed at all.
1520	Maybe Brad knows...
1521	Per Credit, Charlie Hoang on the Confirm Desk needs an Enron Corp. guaranty of the attached physical pulp & paper deal.
1521	I told Credit that your group handles physical P&P.
1522	Can you please send a copy of the executed master and any amendments thereto to David Dupre on the Confirm Desk.
1522	Thanks!
1522	(watch out, there are 2 David Dupres!)
1523	Yes, to North America, Australia and Japan.
1524	With respect to the referenced list, my instructions from power was to shut down Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Lower Colorado River Authority from both execute and view status for power.
1524	With respect to Lower Colorado River Authority and bandwidth, I spoke to the Broadband team, and they haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth, so they are running it by outside counsel (who happens to be in Singapore this week), and will get back to me.
1524	So until I hear otherwise, I am shutting them down for bandwidth.
1525	Yes, I've prepared the assignment, I am just waiting for the lawyer to sign off on it.
1526	Andrea Hauser w/EnronOnline called and said that Marathon has a problem with the terms of the online GTC's (default language) for LPG, petrochems, and refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers.
1526	Marathon's lawyer is Rhonda Stinemyer and her # is 713/296-2408.
1526	Can you let Andrea know who will be handling this.
1526	Thanks.
1527	Sure!
1528	Please note new products.
1528	Let me know if you have any issues or concerns with any of these.
1529	I'm getting ready right now to fax it over to Meg.
1530	At the request of Sara, I am attaching the ETA.
1530	I am also sending the PA, just in case...
1531	I just got a call from Kevin Meredith on the Confirm Desk and it appears that the referenced internal entities have done a trade yesterday and have done other trades in the past and we need to get a master in place.
1531	Can you send us up some credit.
1531	Much thanks.
1532	Per emails below, Mike Robison, attorney (x36667) and Nony Flores, Paralegal (x37541) will handle.
1533	Thanks for your help!
1534	Mary Lynne, These notices will be coming by email on a going forward basis.
1535	Will alan handle this?
1536	It's back dated to the oldest outstanding trade with the counterparty.
1537	Point well taken!
1538	Why, I do believe the three Tudor deals gets us to 451!
1539	Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...!
1539	We were in the process of revising our form, so I just have to draft up an Canadian version of the sample ISDA master and get yoou a draft.
1539	I'll try and get to it the next day or two.
1540	I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master competition.
1540	I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the outcome of this race.
1540	Could such slanderous allegations be true?
1541	Upon further reflection of the undue influence you have attempted in the past and are currently attempting (need we forget you trying to get Bob Crane not to sign my agreements!), it seems like you have a lack of confidence in your abilities and are therefore unable to run a clean race!
1542	Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the Interest Rate and Currency Desk.
1542	If possible, we would also like them to see the comments screen.
1542	The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.
1542	As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.
1542	Can you keep me posted on their access.
1542	Thanks!
1543	Here is a picture of Alicia's baby.
1543	It really is a pretty baby!
1544	Attached is the referenced list.
1544	No problems with this counterparty.
1545	Per attached email from Leslie, can you open this counterparty up for all power.
1545	Thanks!
1546	Did I mention Andrea Calo in Argentina needs a set?
1547	Need to know the scoop on City of Roseville and Puget Sound...
1548	Joe, I got a call from the Coral people that a corrected confirm had already been sent to them PRIOR to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of the trade.
1548	I'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know I was working on this, but I told the Coral people I still needed the assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight.
1548	Even tho I hate to have to do the additional work, with these EOL trades, there is no "oops" trade.
1548	Once we enter into the trade with 1 entity of a counterparty, we cannot just "move" the trade.
1548	We need the consent of the assignor and assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was not legally moved.
1548	If eveyone on your team is not aware of this, can you mention it at your next group meeting...thanks!
1549	I'm working on my backlog of lists.
1549	I thought I'd send thru a few so you could get started.
1550	HS Energy Services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the ESP criteria.
1550	It does not meet the financial test on its own.
1550	However, we have approved them to trade financial and have an ISDA Master in place.
1550	Should I shut them down for the Australia products?
1551	On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.
1551	They are part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and obviously, a governmental, before the split up.
1551	They are still a wholly owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to outside counsel about the governmental issues.
1551	I have a call into Canadian counsel right now.
1551	Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto...
1552	Joe, Attached is the termination revised w/Mary's changes.
1552	Give me a call about one change.
1553	Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial power products online.
1553	Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).
1553	Call me if you have any questions about specific counterparties.
1554	Who is going to take over this master from Rod?
1554	They send it in comments and are calling for a response.
1555	You are the woman!
1556	Per instructions from Davis Minns in Australia, I have to shut down HS Energy Services from trading Australian power (not that they are going to!).
1556	I am attaching an amended spreadsheet.
1557	Attached is a resend of the Deemed ISDA that Stepahnie sent to Diane Anderson
1558	Are you or Sara going to work on this?
1559	Clem called wanting to speak to someone about the guaranty issue.
1559	Who should I direct him to?
1560	Per our conversation, attached is the form of confirmation we use when we adopt by reference the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement into a form of confirmation.
1561	Fred wanted to get this draft out today, so I had to get it back from Mary and get Robert Bruce to review it, then sent it out.
1562	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing a redlined draft of the guaranty.
1562	Please let me (713/853-3399) or Sara (713/853-5620) know if this change meets with your approval.
1562	Further, I am in the process of drafting the Enron Corp. Guaranty with respect to ECT Investments, Inc. and hope to have it to you shortly.
1563	Attached is termination revised with Mary's changes.
1563	Per Mary's conv.
1563	w/Fred, if the Counterparty failed to make payments hereunder, the contract would not be void ab initio, but instead, any payments to the counterparty would be offset against any amounts owing to us.
1564	Mike, Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.
1564	Is there some way for us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?
1564	He is a lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting him security access.
1564	Can we get him access?
1565	I should be available anytime this week, with the caveat, we have a big deal we're trying to close by Friday, and it could heat up at any moment.
1565	How about tomorrow at 1:00 pm?
1566	I have a meeting at 2:00pm.
1566	How about 11:00 am?
1567	Does any of the below work for you?
1568	Let's say 2:30 pm tomorrow and hope for the best!
1569	As we spoke I got scheduled for a 2:30 too, so how about 3:30 tomorrow?
1570	Mike, How can these people access the database?
1571	I need the following 3 files 1st thing: Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc. Ontario Power Generation Royal Bank of Canada/Enron Canada Corp. Thanks!
1572	Online would like to open this counterparty immediately for trading.
1572	Can you let me know ASAP whether you have any legal issues with them.
1572	Thanks.
1573	Per our conv.
1573	earlier, attached is our standard form of Enron Corp. Guaranty.
1574	The above counterparty is approved to trade all products.
1575	Attached are the two ISDA's.
1576	We have been pressured by the online team to open up all counterparties to trade financial unless we have a LEGAL reason not to trade with them.
1576	With both those counterparties, you are correct, it is the companies' intention and direction that we trade financial with those entities, but still for online I have to say "yes" unless I have a "legal" reason to say "no".
1577	All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them for all financial products.
1577	If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for financial products including Australian financial products.
1577	Further, if they cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather per our earlier emails).
1578	I was just about to call you when I got your email.
1578	Holly called and she has a table to fill at an awards banquet (some women's professional group or something) and wants to know if you want to join us.
1578	A bunch of her girlfriends are going, me, Lucinda, I think Carol....anyway, it's Saturday night at 7:00 pm.
1578	She said it should be really boring (so I put it on my calendar as "boring awards banquet"), but with all the girls at one table we'll misbehave and have fun.
1578	I hope you can join us.
1578	Let me know and I'll reserve you a spot w/Holly.
1578	The thing on your house and townhome sounds exciting.
1578	When can I see it?!
1579	I'm having a little online brain drain today...am I correct in my thinking that all these "spreads" are financial...?
1580	Can you provide Stephanie Sever with the Online team view access to the referenced database.
1580	Can you let us know when the access has been granted.
1580	Thanks!
1581	This list is all amended counterparties, most of them being opened up for financial power.
1581	My records reflect that all of them were already open for financial products, except the three I have marked.
1581	If you run across any others that you show as not being open for financial, let me know, because all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial.
1582	Also, on this list, my records reflect that Superior Natural Gas Corporation was shut down for physical power.
1582	If you records do not reflect the same, can you shut them down...thanks!
1583	I don't know about you, but I LOVE lists with only one counterparty to approve, how about you?!!
1584	I have a database where I maintain my online approval, and my the basis for my approvals/declines.
1584	If you want to review counterparties we have previously approved/disapproved and why, or want to go in and to see what I approved on a specific counterparty, this would be the place to go.
1584	Would you like me to get you access?
1585	Well, I do believe this makes 450!
1585	A nice round number if I do say so myself!
1586	At a ratio of 10:1, you should have your 4th one signed and have the fifth one on the way...
1587	It seems like it should be more, but I have review over 1300 counterparties for online trading.
1588	Straight and to the point!
1589	We have received a proposed assignment from PPL Corporation to PPL Energy Plus, LLC wherein they would like to assign their financial transactions (two), any guaranty relating thereto (do we have one covering financial?), and any master agreement (we have no financial agreement with them).
1589	Is this OK with Credit?
1589	I am having a copy of the assignment walked down to you.
1589	If someone else is going to approve this, let me know.
1590	I left Bill Ernstaft a message.
1590	Hopefully I'll hear back from him after lunch.
1591	As usual, you are the best!
1592	We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of 9/1/00 wherein Coral Energy Resources, L.P. assigned to Coral Energy Holding, L.P. an "oops" EOL trade # 40063 it did under the wrong password.
1592	A copy will be sent to Jeff Sorenson.
1593	That job is with Bob Williams, the litigation attorney for our international company.
1593	Bob is a great guy, probably one of the funniest people I have ever known.
1593	It also might be a good job for you because he promoted his last administrative assistant to paralegal.
1594	comments to the swap docuemnts
1595	Paul, I just spoke to Brent Hendry who worked on the Bermuda law advice, and he said he sent you the name of counsel.
1595	I will also sent to you tonight a copy of the advice we just got with respect to derivative transactions and online transactions.
1596	Too late, already sent it.
1597	I would love to have the plants as long as they can take direct sun...can they?
1597	Did you see on the news last night that they arrested 44 people for participating in that pyramid scheme you were telling me about?
1597	There's an article about it in the KHOU TV website.
1598	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching our current from of ISDA Schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for such entities.
1598	With respect to NYPA, we do have a copy of an authorization to hedge approved by the Board of Trustees of NYPA that they faxed us a year ago and I will fax a copy of it over to you shortly.
1599	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/23/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.
1599	Copies will be distributed.
1600	FUNB sits stalled on my desk waiting for me to have time to work on it.
1600	We are in the miiddle of a rush with Financial Power counterparties in need immediate assistance (many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention) and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and I'm just putting out fires.
1600	That master is really not a priority at all for ENA, and it is only Enron.Credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority.
1600	What is your proposed timing for a deal on that one?
1601	It isn't clear to me whether you are on for this banquet tomorrow so I can RSVP to Holly!
1602	Per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at NYPA, they would like to transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we consider an "ISDA Confirmation" (it seemed to me their lawyer thought this document was a sufficient ISDA Master).
1602	Sara has a call into him to get his thoughts about this document Per my conversations w/Sara, we would like to get our standard governmental form of ISDA Master in place.
1602	We wonder what your thoughts are on his document.
1602	Further, he seemed quite firm that they would not be issuing a legal opinion, but would give us a certified copy of the resolution I am about to fax to you.
1602	We look forward to getting your comments.
1603	I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of broadband masters potentially close to signature.
1603	However, I was a little cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we have 13 masters out for signatures right now.
1603	It still may be hard to beat you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the game...GO TEAM!!!
1604	FYI, I will be preparing this assignment for signature.
1605	On the list for 9/19/00: 1.
1605	On the counterparty styled "United States Department of Interior" only, Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them read access.
1605	2.
1605	Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them for financial power On the list for 9/21/00: I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of Utilicorp.
1605	However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I hope by my note only it will do the job.
1605	I am also preparing an assignment of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.
1606	I have forwarded your email on to Mary Cook, she is actually the attorney working on the transaction.
1606	I am a paralegal.
1606	Her direct number is
1607	You're welcome.
1608	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing clean and blacklined drafts of each of the Bow River Trust and Royal Bank of Canada ISDA Schedules.
1609	Leslie Hansen asked me to forward to you our draft list of Legal contacts for online trading issues, and see if there is anyone you deal with on a regular basis that I may not know of that we need to add to the list.
1610	I hope you're OK?!
1610	You probably don't remember (especially after getting hit by that polo ball!), but Barclays is one you negotiated on your secondment here oh so many years ago.
1610	It's always good to hear from you...
1611	Obviously, you haven't lost your touch!
1612	Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.
1612	When we get this in signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment, but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention, we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this will cost us money too! We don't want to have to do this too often.) Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?!
1613	Yes, except for weather, the financial GTC's are designed to cover all energy commodities.
1614	Per a conv.
1614	I just had with John Arnold, Shankman is not trading natural gas at all.
1614	His back trade is Mike Maggi.
1615	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 23, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
1615	Copies will be distributed to Frank Davis and to Peter Keohane for the Enron Canada Talisman file.
1616	Per our conversation, attached is the proposed form of amendment to the ISDA Master to provide for cash collateral under the Credit Support Annex.
1616	Please call me at 713/853-3399 or Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Department at 713/853-3263 if you have any comments or questions.
1617	Per our conversation, the above counterparty is approved by Legal to trade online physical pulp & paper only.
1617	We cannot trade financial until Credit receives financial statements and can determine whether they are an eligible swap participant or not.
1618	Chris, Per our conversation, I am attaching a sample form of ISDA for both a Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.
1618	With the governmental, the proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).
1618	As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any governmental guarantor.
1618	If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let me know and I'll send you down the revisions.
1618	By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.
1618	I have to say that if you end up transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not include the reps and warranties required to transact with such counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to execution of a master.
1618	If you go down that road we may have to come up with some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.
1619	The bottom of this email will explain my email to Gaffer.
1620	Thanks Joe, you're the best!
1621	I'm sad (sniff...sniff...sniff...)...
1622	Russell, I spoke to the cpy about this, and what it turned out he wanted was the Local Currency ISDA form.
1622	I gave that redraft to Mary to sign off on the same day I wrote that note, but she's been too busy to look at it, and the file is now MIA from her office.
1622	I'll check with her tomorrow and she what she did with it.
1623	I would like to take the week of Thanksgiving off.
1623	My mom is coming from NY to visit with my 10 year old niece.
1624	It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.
1624	Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.
1624	Now that the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online approvals.
1624	The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade US bandwidth segments.
1624	P.S.
1624	we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list.
1625	Thanks, I appreciate it!
1625	What should I do with the Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list?
1625	Shut them down for all trading on Japan based products until I hear from you?
1625	Will you be coming to the Legal Conference here in Houston next week?
1625	Maybe we could chat then?!
1626	FYI, I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and reasons why (if there are any!).
1626	I don't know to what extent Frank ever looked at it, but you might find it helpful.
1626	It is called "ENA Legal Online Trading Agreements" database.
1626	If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to get you access.
1627	As a reminder, We need to talk about some documentation Marcus Nettleton passed on to me for handling.
1627	It's about the disclosure of the MG acquisition, some subordination loans & guarantees w/the NYMEX.
1627	I asked Al Pennisi if it could wait until you got back and he said yes.
1628	Mike, Can you take care of this and let us know when Lisa has access.
1628	Thanks.
1629	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 9/12/00 which amends the ETA to provide that Ameren Energy, Inc. can act as authorized agent for and on behalf of the following entities ("Operating Companies") under such ETA: 1.
1629	Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE) 2.
1629	Ameren Energy Generating Company 3.
1629	Ameren Energy Marketing Company The amendment to the ETA makes additional changes with respect to the agency relationship between Ameren Energy, Inc. and the Operating Companies.
1629	In connection with such amendment to the ETA we have also received: 1.
1629	The originally executed Password Application 2.
1629	Consent and Acknowledgement executed by the Operating Companies with respect to such agency relationship Copies will be distributed.
1630	Yes.
1631	Attached are (1) the RMT Confirms and (2) the Incumbency Certificates required to be executed under the ISDA.
1632	Attached please the proposed forms of Confirmation with respect to the referenced transaction.
1632	Please call me or Sara Shackleton if you have any comments or questions.
1633	I have some appointments outside the office this afternoon and will need to leave early today.
1634	I don't know why I am on these emails?
1635	Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.
1635	We do not have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.
1635	I would take it if things proceed today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the agreement will be the only identifying information.
1635	Toronto-Dominion will need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm that it is acceptable.
1635	I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.
1636	Can you change Peter's name, I had it wrong, it's "Peter C.M. Keohane".
1636	Thanks!
1637	Please find attached a clean and blacklined draft of the revised ISDA Master.
1638	Per, What's the deal he's talking about?
1638	I also do not think we could put ENA and Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.
1638	When you have a mingute give me a ring.
1639	Please call Morris Clark or Steve Douglas.
1640	Jeff hasn't left the group, has he?
1641	Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the Schedule reflecting your insert.
1641	I think it is our intention to just insert the revised page into the agreement.
1642	Here is the interest rate we are going to mirror to create for Toronto Dominion.
1643	NYPA called today wanting to know the status of our review.
1643	Can we pow wow about this 1st thing Monday...
1644	I do not know the answer to your question.
1644	I suggest you talk to Credit.
1644	Financial does indeed have a master with Weyerhaueser Company Limited.
1644	I have no idea what we trade physical under or what other Weyerhaueser companies we may have business with.
1645	I am just confirming with each of you that I will be opening up The Toa Reinsurance Company Limited, a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list to trade all physical and financial products, including Australian and Japanese weather, which seems to be the products they are truly interested in trading.
1645	Let me know if you have any problems with that immediately.
1646	I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.
1646	On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I already had them open for emissions.
1646	Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for physical gas.
1647	I confirmed w/Brad that they are still an ESP, so it's OK to open them up for all financial.
1648	What's the scoop on this?
1649	Will do, I'll send you a copy too.
1649	I'm just waiting to get Sara's direction on one comment to the Legal Opinion, then I'll be ready to send it out.
1650	As you all are probably aware, we trade physical and financial products with Northern Illinois Gas Company under each of the following names: 1 Northern Illinois Gas Company (the legal incorporated entity) 2.
1650	Nicor Gas Company (an assumed name for Northern Illinois Gas Company as reflected in the Assumed Name Certificate dated 12/15/99 filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois. The name needs to match the Assumed Name Certificate, no "Co.") 3.
1650	Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company The EnronOnline counterparty has been set up as "Nicor Gas Company".
1650	Pursuant to Bob Bruce's conversation with our Illinois outside counsel, we are comfortable transacting business in the State of Illinois under the assumed name "Nicor Gas Company".
1650	In connection therewith, it is OK to set up the online entity as "Nicor Gas Company", and attach the relevant physical or financial products to the relevant master under each of the above counterparty names.
1650	Further, it will be OK if the confirmations go out as "Nicor Gas Company" even though the masters may be under one of the above names.
1650	PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, this should be considered an exception to the rule.
1650	We do not want counterparties to be set up under assumed names, d/b/a's or divisions for EnronOnline.
1650	As previously agreed with the Online team, every attempt should be made to incorporate the legal name as part of the counterparty name (such as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" or "Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division").
1650	Any exceptions to this should be run by Legal for approval.
1651	Did you make a note under H.Q.
1651	Energy Services in Lotus Notes...?
1652	No can do...just made appt.
1652	to go to lunch with CSS.
1652	However, he cancels on me half the time, so if he cancels again I'd love to go...
1653	At the request of Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, I am attaching a copy of our proposed form of Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and proposed form of counterparty legal opinion.
1653	If you have any questions, please call Sara at (713) 853-5620 or me at (713) 853-3399.
1653	We look forward to getting your comments.
1654	We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 ("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and option transactions" with ENA.
1654	For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we trade.
1654	For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps and options.
1654	If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.
1654	I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts and Camille Gerard.
1655	Pretty funny!
1655	I went over to harass him, but he must be on vacation!
1656	The Mounties have arrived!
1657	When you have a minute can we talk about this...thanks!
1658	Attached is revised list opening Edison Mission Marketing & Trade for emissions.
1659	For Xeron, Inc.-amended no change means, they were initially open for financial, shut down for power, open for all other physical products.
1659	No change from that approval.
1660	My assistant, Taffy Milligan will be sending it to you.
1661	There seems to be some question whether Utilicorp.
1661	can trade financial.
1661	I opened them to trade all financial (including power) on 7/26/00.
1661	I think the customer is calling Kathy for access.
1661	There should be no change in their physical power profile.
1662	can you fax her the fron of the ISDA Schedule for Utilicorp.
1662	She must be in the Oslo office.
1663	Matt, Can you provide me with the name and address of who we should send this amendment to for signature?
1663	I still have to run it by an attorney, though.
1664	Attached is the referenced list.
1664	I am saying "amended-no change" because for Calpine, I originally had them open for power & financial, and I am not changing that approval, and for Nicor, I originally had them open for financial and shut down for power and I am not changing that approval.
1665	I'm preparing for a presentation I have to give tomorrow.
1665	Once I'm done with this I'll give you a call...
1666	Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement with ECC covering financial trades only).
1666	Per my conversation a second ago with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.
1666	Sounds to me you need to call Credit for approval.
1666	If we do not have a master, they would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.
1667	See email below to John.
1668	Sounds good to me!
1669	Take today off (from EOL at least!).
1670	We just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from Deutsche Bank, and I hope to respond back to you shortly, once I have had a chance to confirm they made all the changes.
1671	The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm.
1672	It was cute!
1673	Can you forward alison the template for an omnibus swap.
1673	The attached appears to be an EOL template.
1674	Can you pass this on to the next person...thanks!
1675	It's really all Genia's fault, she goes to lunch too darn early.
1675	I guess we need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...!
1676	On the 10/05/00 List: Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers: the President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or Assistant Secretary.
1676	If you are going to trade with them online you must ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those above signs the documentation.
1676	Because of this signatory restriction EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.
1676	It's up to your group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.
1676	If you would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it up to me.
1677	It's no surprise to me to find Reggie's been stirring it up!
1678	We have been doing this here in Houston via a Unanimous Consent of the Directors of the Company appointing the individual(s) as agents and attorneys-in-fact.
1678	Do you sugguest I proceed this way or via the Power of Attorney below?
1679	FYI-waiting for direction.
1680	That change will have to be approved by Mark Taylor, who is out of town until next week.
1681	These could take a few days (or more!).
1681	They have to be circulated to the directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their availability for signature.
1681	If Amita wants to start signing today, she can go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of today.
1682	John Arnold wants this counterparty opened ASAP for financial.
1682	We didn't have any financial statements from them when they originally came thru, so we couldn't determine their ESP status, but we're OK now, so if you could open them for financial ASAP.
1682	Thanks.
1683	I just got off the phone w/Derek.
1683	I'll make sure someone handles it.
1684	Karen, Upon re-review w/Credit, we have decided not to open this counterparty up for financial trading until further legal and credit issues are resolved.
1685	Thanks, I appreciate your help!
1686	Thanks Joe, you're the best!
1687	Dear Greg, As we discussed, I am attaching our proposed form of ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex for your review.
1687	If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 713/853-3399.
1687	We look forward to hearing from you.
1687	cc: Tom May Ed Sacks, Credit Bob Bruce, Senior Counsel
1688	MALCOLM Greg -CONTROLLER Let me know if you still don't get the attachment.
1689	We will try to get back to them soon.
1689	We had to locate Indiana counsel to advise us on this, and hope to engage them today.
1690	Please remember that all online confidentiality agreement should be logged in through me, I prepare a list of them for the Online Team.
1690	All regular conffidentiality agreements should be logged in through one of the paralegals so we can monitor them.
1690	Also, we need to do a conflicts check with Kay.
1690	Thanks.
1691	Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau sent up for our review.
1691	We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading websites, and (2) respond to Craig about this agreement.
1691	When you both get back in town can we set a time to discuss this.
1691	Thanks...
1692	This seems like something the Confirmation Desk should do, or you.
1692	I have never dealt with the deal tickets before.
1693	I don't see any problem with this request, do you?
1694	Per our conversation while you were here, attached is a list of all the Japanese counterparties that have requested Password Applications from EnronOnline.
1694	Let me know you thoughts about this, and, as we discussed, online due diligence with respect to Japanese counterparties.
1695	I don't think there is any problem with this.
1695	But since Harry told me to run it by you, I am.
1695	Could you sign off ASAP.
1695	Thanks!
1696	Any problem?
1697	Can y'all help me get the document below signed by an officer of ECC and return the originally signed document to me.
1697	I will send them all out together back to the counterparty.
1697	FYI-Andy Zipper is second in command to Louise Kitchen for EnronOnline.
1697	Thanks for your help!
1698	Why aren't you playing polo?
1698	Has your horse accepted other film roles after your smashing success in Gladiator?
1698	P.S.
1698	Missed you at the seminar, it's just not the same when you're not there...!
1699	I check with Legal in the US and the UK, and were have no problem with Utilicorp trading UK crude and crude products.
1700	Thanks to all of you for getting this done so quickly!
1700	You are the best!
1701	Always happy to hear from my favorite outside counsel!
1702	Thanks Justy!
1703	Per Leslie's earlier email, she wants power trading for Tri-State only under one entity, so I have shut down Tri-State Power Marketing (the division), and have opened them up under Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., which, per my conv.
1703	w/Stephanie, is being amended to add "through its Tri-State Power Marketing Division" to the PA.
1704	I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and ENA.
1704	Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of Japan.
1704	Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next week to discuss this.
1705	In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we will be providing to the Online team.
1705	Before we send this out, I have been asked to send the list to each of you for your input.
1705	Please let me or Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we need to make to the list.
1706	I do not believe that statement is correct.
1706	The limitation was required in the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all agreements.
1706	Can you send me up a copy of the Password Application and I will give Steve Norris a call.
1706	Thanks.
1707	Great!
1707	Look forward to hearing from you.
1707	If you have any questions give me a call...
1708	I'll wait for your direction since we need to communicate this to EOL and Credit.
1709	Mary, you don't need to copy me on these types of emails.
1710	taffy, in the future, can you just print out the calendar and leave it in my in box.
1710	Thanks.
1711	Taffy, these are all finance deals that Sara worked on.
1711	Can you work with her to get copies of the ISDA Masters for this guy in the Audit group.
1711	Check Lotus Notes to see if we have blue files, and if not, check w/Sara.
1712	Stephanie worked on this.
1712	Stephanie, can you get with Bob...
1713	Attached is documentation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State reflecting the name change of Engage Energy US, L.P. to Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., such name change to be effective on October 3, 2000 (per the corrective amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State attached hereto. Please make a note of this name change in your records.
1714	Davis Minns, Robert McGrory, and Alison Keogh in the Australia Legal Office, and Jane McBride and Yo Yamanishi in the Japan Legal office need full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database in Lotus Notes.
1714	Can you let me know when this has happened.
1714	Can you also get the view capability to the Legal Online Trading Database.
1714	Thanks
1715	I have received a Notice of Assignment that effective 8/21/00, Public Service Electric and Gas Company has transferred to PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC its interest in the ETA with ENA dated 01/11/00.
1715	A copy of the assignment will be sent to Lisa and Tom.
1715	Please let me know if you have any problems with this assignment.
1715	If not, I will get Leslie Hansen to sign off on the form and get it signed.
1716	Sure, see your there.
1717	Per our conversation, attached is the form of ISDA Agreement, with Enron guaranty attached to it.
1717	As we discussed, Cadwalader will issue an enforceability opinion with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty, so we need to provide them with an opinion with respect to Enron Corp. general corporate matters.
1717	Thanks for your help!
1718	Mary, At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
1718	Please call me or Bob with any comments or questions you might have.
1718	My phone no is 713/853-3399 and Bob can be reached at 713/853-0397.
1718	If the agreement meets with your approval, please fax a signed copy to me at 713/646-3490.
1718	We look forward to hearing from you.
1719	I received a faxed copy of the Customer Registration Form, Password Application and Letter Agreement amending the ETA.
1719	I expect the originals to follow tomorrow.
1719	I will have copies walked down to Lisa since the customer is eager to start trading.
1719	I will follow with the originals in the usual course of business.
1720	No, no ISDA's or other master agreements in place with this counterparty.
1721	I think maybe if we could get together with Frank and call Jeff then we could resolve this w/o continuing circular conversations.
1721	Jeff is familiar with the issue now.
1722	Below is an icon that will get you view access to the financial agreement database.
1722	This lists all the financial agreements we either have executed or have drafts out to the counterparty (except Australia, which we are currently loading into the database).
1722	This database is available with view access to any Enron employee.
1722	If you have any questions about a specific entry, please do not hesitate to call me (or email me!).

1723	Derek Davies faxed down copies to the Enmax master and the file is missing.
1723	Can you let me know if you have it.
1723	Thanks.
1724	It was somehow sent to me to.
1724	I think they're sending it to all employees.
1725	This email appears to have gone to all Houston Legal, or all Houston.
1725	You might want to check your distribution lists.
1726	Per my voicemail, attached is the ISDA Agreement revised to reflect those guaranty changes you agreed to.
1727	Attached is the referenced list.
1727	My "amended-no change" means I am OK with Credit changes.
1727	Do I owe you some other old lists?
1728	Well, just mentioning the landmark levels now, we just hit 460...it's not impossible that we won't get 40 more in by the end of the year...
1729	Yeah, yeah, yeah...we're still waiting for 4!!!
1730	Per the attached, I think we will need to amend our board resolution(s) to add Cassandra as a signatory.
1730	The ENA resolution appeared to have Ted specifically.
1731	We have a 3:00 meeting tomorrow w/Lisa Lees and phone in to Jeff Blumenthal in tax to discuss metals and Japan issues re: signing PA's and any other documentation (in your office).
1732	My assistant Taffy Milligan is tracking these down for you.
1732	Her direct no is
1733	Mike Haney with EBS.
1734	I checked w/the Corp. Secretary's office, and they were unaware that Rex and Dave were appointed as MD's, so the corporate paralegal is getting the board resolution passed adding them on, as well as adding Mark Palmer as a VP.
1735	Neither Enron London nor Enron London/Singapore has an ISDA Master in place with Union Oil Company of California.
1735	ENA does, but that won't help you.
1736	Mark, Mieco is the cpy where we had the misposted/bad online trade & we held up their master.
1736	Can we send it out?
1737	Remember as those Ameren Energy Inc., as agent, etc. for various companies we got ETA amendments in for.
1737	They are coming thru tonight as as online counterparty but want to start trading today.
1737	Any problems?
1738	Are you working on an ETA amendment for them?
1739	Justin I've been running around trying to determine whether we have a tax problems with Amita doing what she's doing for the above companies, and I'm hearing that you've already cleared that with tax.
1739	Can you please confirm this for me.
1740	First, this counterparty is OK to trade physical power.
1740	I just spoke to Leslie, and she said it was OK to set up "Ameren Energy, Inc. as Agent " under one cpy id # for the three utilities and that's how they would trade.
1740	We spoke to Melissa Murphy on the Power Confirm Desk and she is going to set up a special confirmation template that will add the three utilities names to the confirmations before they go out.
1740	I think this is how Global Counterparty already set them up.
1740	If this doesn't compute, let me know...
1740	The Confirmations would then go out as Ameren Energy, Inc., as Authorized Agent for and on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing Company, Ameren Energy Gathering Company, and Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE).
1741	Are you holding up this cpy for any reason?
1742	We have received the executed Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 10/18/00.
1742	I will deliver a copy to Dovie Keprta, until I receive any further direction as to who you would like to be the central file keeper for eMarket Services documents.
1743	Thanks for the note.
1743	Just pass on my concern for Clarissa and hope for her improvement.
1744	I'm OK all day long, so just email me when you want to chat (our time) and I'll make sure I'm at my desk.
1745	Just a note to remind you to add the "ESP' and "Country" information to clickpaper spreadsheets too so I can get those out while you're gone.
1746	At the request of David Minns their short name in Lotus Notes will be EAF (for Enron Australia Finance).
1746	David gave me a list of their masters, so I am going to enter just the names and agreement.
1746	David and Alison will flesh out the rest of the data when he gets back.
1747	Leslie Hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.
1747	I told her we were meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can control and prevent "rogue" trading.
1747	She said before she sent this out she would contact you.
1748	The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered them into the database.
1748	We still don't have copies.
1748	Further, I don't know more than if it's executed and the date.
1748	They need to flesh out the additional information that is required.
1749	ANP Marketing Company has faxed in their PA and ETA amendment and we should get the originals in by fedex today.
1749	They are hot to trade ERCOT online, and I don't know if they can trade it or not, but if we could move them up to the top of the credit review list they would be most happy.
1750	The critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued.
1750	Thanks for your help.
1751	Thanks for the heads up!
1751	As usual, you're the best!
1752	Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the changes to the ISDA Schedule.
1752	We have also attached the proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and the legal opinions of Enron North America and Enron Corp. The opinions of Cadwalader with respect to the ISDA and the Guaranty will be sent shortly under separate cover from Susan Lobel at Cadwalader.
1752	It appears the only remaining issue on the ISDA is the "Conditions Precedent" provision which NYPA is still considering.
1752	Please let me know if these changes meet with your approval.
1753	I bet you thought I forgot about you?!
1753	The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed form of guaranty.
1753	We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being done.
1753	If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.
1754	We have received the executed Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information with the referenced Counterparty dated effective 10/1/00.
1754	Copies will be distributed.
1755	Harry, I believe this is yours...
1756	We have received the originally executed Letter Agreement amending the referenced Electronic Trading Agreement.
1756	Copies will be distributed.
1756	We also received the originally executed Password Application and Customer Registration Form.
1756	I will send those down to EOL and no copies will be kept in Legal.
1757	Thanks for your help here.
1757	Can you do me one more favor?
1757	Can you check and make sure I am the only person that has access to change keywords.
1757	Thanks!
1758	Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.
1758	You should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access only. They should not see our comments. That information is confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege).
1758	Let me know if you do not have edit access.
1758	Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside your area of responsibility.
1758	A few notes...
1758	There is some great reporting functionality in this database.
1758	Check out some of the sorts on the left.
1758	There is a drop down called "Pending Swap Update".
1758	That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial agreements.
1758	There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate reports for you compan The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.
1758	Kinda, before you do/authorize a trade read this.
1758	Not for general legal notes.
1758	Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded elsewise (it will mess up reporting).
1758	If you are amending an agreement or superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".
1758	I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs.
1758	If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.
1758	Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.
1758	This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.
1758	Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.
1758	If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.
1758	We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.
1758	Link -->
1759	Left message with George Gilbert.
1759	FYI, Jen Fraser left Fred's group and is now with EGM.
1760	I was just sitting here thinking, now that y'all are doing the financial confirms up there, your Confirmation Desk people need to be on the distribution list for our emails when we get signed masters in, so they know when they need to change from a non-master style of confirm, to a master style of confirm.
1760	Who, pray tell, might your Confirmation Desk people be so we can add them...
1761	We have received an executed Assignment and Novation Agreement dated 8/16/00 where EOL commodity swap Deal No. 267025, transacted 6/23/00 originally between Amoco Canada ("Amoco Canada") Petroleum Company and Enron Canada Corp. The trade has been assigned as follows: Amoco Canada assigned its interest in the trade to BP Amoco Corporation ECC assigned its interest in the trade to ENA.
1761	Copies will be distributed.
1762	Pay : Bank of America, N.A. For the Account of : Enron North America Corp. Account Number/ CHIPS UID
1763	There are a number of Argentina counterparties on this list that I will need your sign off on.
1763	Brent said he things they will probably be OK to trade Argentina Gas, but to run it by you.
1763	Can you let me know if you have any issues.
1763	I am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too.
1763	Initially, we should have a rush of Argentina counterparties, but after awhile, it should dwindle.
1763	The rule is, you have ONE DAY to respond or I will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list.
1764	We do not have an ISDA master in place with this cpy, however, Susan Bailey and Sara Shackleton did send them a draft in August.
1764	I would think unless ECTRIC is going to be a direct cpy to a master, Craig Young should contact Susan and Sara directly...?
1765	Can you sent out that original Participation Agreement for signature to the cpy.
1765	I am attaching my form of letter so you can copy it.
1765	Thanks.
1766	Can you please send this cpy a copy of their ISDA Master.
1766	The contact is Kimberly Gentle at (509) 495-4055, fax (509) 495-8176.
1766	Thanks.
1767	Since this is a financial product I don't need approvals back from any of you.
1767	I really just wanted to alert you to this new product, especially the physical steel team.
1768	I just got a call from the online team, and there is a rush push on from London to get this counterparty approved ASAP.
1768	Since you are the key person, I thought I'd pull you into the loop.
1768	This counterparty should be coming thru on tomorrow's approval list.
1768	I know you've got to do your due diligence, so if you could let me know how long it will take to get back to me I can let the EOL and London people know.
1768	Much thanks!
1768	P.S.
1768	I enjoyed chatting with you at the seminar!
1769	Per Jane's email, I think we can definitely approve them to trade Japanese products.
1769	I want to confirm with her the approval for the rest of the products, tho I think they'll probably be OK too.
1769	So today, you could open them for Japan.
1770	I have told EOL this counterparty is approved to trade Japanese products.
1770	I just want to confirm with you, are they also approved to trade all the other products, physical and financial around the world?
1771	Attached is our proposed form of agreement.
1771	If the counterparty has any questions, please have them call me.
1772	Can you please get me off whatever distribution list my name is on.
1772	I am not a member of any of those groups below.
1773	Michael Just a note that we are still waiting on sign off from Tax before we get this signed.
1774	Attached is a revised copy of the referenced list.
1774	Please note that we will be adding the NDA's coming in through the eMarket Services Group of Enron Net Works to this list.
1775	Just confirming...for Utilicorp.
1775	we previously had them open for Enron Sales only....
1776	I'm having our messengers walk over two copies of the NDA initialled by Leslie Hansen.
1776	If you could have one of your officers, VP or above sign them, and then when fully executed by the Company, return the original to me.
1776	Thanks!
1777	Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: December 10, 1996 Executed Date: October 20, 2000 Enron Entity: Enron Canada Corp.

1778	I'm going to call you Quick Draw McGraw!
1779	With respect to the "amends": Calpine Power: was already open for financial-no change to that approval Utilicorp.: I originally had Enron sales only for power, but Leslie is now telling me to open them for all power.
1779	Constellation: I originally had them shut down for financial, so I am opening them up.
1779	I originally had them shut down for power and they should stay shut down.
1780	Below is a revised presentation from the EOL team that should have the most updated slides for MEH's online presentation that you are working on.
1781	Is OK w/you to copy the profile below, for the new gas product at the end of this email?
1782	OK for me.
1783	What's the scoop on this?
1784	Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.
1784	We don't know what it will take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or Mark Frevert to sign.
1785	You're the best!
1786	Again, can you please take me off whatever distribution list I am on.
1786	Thanks.
1787	I sent it to the crude oil option trader.
1787	Is that good enough?
1788	I'm not sending this out.
1788	I'm trying to get off this list too.
1789	This is not my distribution.
1789	I am trying to get off of it too!
1790	Travis needs to get copies of the ETA's below.
1790	I don't know if there is someone here in Houston that can get them for him, or someone in London.
1790	I usually would have called Edmund on this but he's out sick for awhile.
1790	Can you track it down for us?
1790	Thanks!
1791	Euromoney stopped doing their great seminar a few years back.
1791	We have not yet found any other seminar that equals it.
1791	I'll keep my eyes posted, though.
1792	You bet.
1792	I faxed a copy out to them earlier this afternoon.
1792	We also faxed a copy to London, and hope to get it back signed by EnronCredit.com first thing tomorrow morning.
1793	My materials are 6 years old.
1793	Do you think they would be of any benefit?
1794	Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.
1794	I need to give EOL responses by Friday for all these counterparties.
1794	In addition, we should have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we have to approve by Friday.
1794	I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.
1794	Thanks!
1795	Nov. 4
1796	Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based EnronCredit.com business team.
1796	Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?
1796	Maybe you need to talk to Erica...
1797	Michael Slade forwarded me your advice with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement with i2 Technologies.
1797	We appreciate your help on this.
1797	Per my conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and pursuing US based customers.
1797	We wanted to confirm with you that on a going forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.
1797	Thanks for your help with this.
1798	We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among Pure Markets Corporation and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 10/25/00.
1798	Copies will be distributed.
1799	Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in Houston Legal.
1799	I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA out to a counterparty.
1799	I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.
1799	She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's provided by counterparties.
1799	We can also assist you with other types of contracts you might need.
1799	My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.
1799	To draft an NDA I will need the following information: 1.
1799	What form of NDA do you want.
1799	We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both parties are providing confidential information.
1799	If we have a situation where we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
1799	2.
1799	What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
1799	3.
1799	The counterparty's full legal name.
1799	5.
1799	Contact name at the counterparty.
1799	6.
1799	How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.
1799	If you would like to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.
1799	If you would like me to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.
1799	If you would like to send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
1799	7.
1799	If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.
1799	I look forward to working with you!
1800	OK, you caught me!!!
1801	Please put on calendar.
1801	Thanks.
1802	FYI
1803	Thanks Lisa!
1804	Attached is our proposed form of NDA.
1804	Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of further service.
1805	Attached is the one way (counterparty) only form you requuested.
1806	Just a note re: "Miller Balish O'Neil PC" on the list from the 25th.
1806	I just had a conversation with Mark about that one, it sounds awfully like a law firm to us.
1806	Unless a member of the Legal Dept. requests a guest ID for a law firm doing legal research for us, we should never grant guest ID's to a law firm.
1806	It can only hurt us!
1806	It's possible it could be an accounting firm.
1806	Per Mark, we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either.
1806	"PC" (for professional corporation) is a good giveaway that we might have one or the other.
1807	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 10/26/00.
1807	Copies will be distributed.
1808	Credit called and asked if we could get them a rush approval on the referenced counterparty.
1808	Let me know if you have anyproblems.
1808	Thanks!
1809	Can you add the physical products to the Legal tab so I don't have to copy them every day.
1809	Thanks!
1810	Re: Rush on Oklahoma.
1810	They are OK for all products.
1811	Above counterparty needs to be opened immediately to trade, specifically coal.
1811	Let me know if you have any problems ASAP.
1812	PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure that they can trade it under the GISB.
1812	They want to amend the ETA to that effect.
1812	I'm not sure how we want to handle this.
1812	Get Stacy/Jeff's approval that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?
1812	The woman who called is Denise Pocius at (973) 430-8181.
1813	We have received the Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement between Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P. and ENA dated 10/5/00.
1813	This amendment makes certain credit changes to the agreement, including, but not limited to, changing Counterparty's Guarantor from UEI Holdings Inc., formerly know as Union Energy Inc. ("UEI") to The Coastal Corporation ("Coastal").
1813	Copies of this Amendment and the new guarantees issued in connection therewith will be distributed.
1814	Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the final revisions.
1814	Let me know if they meet with your approval and I will start processing them for signature.
1815	Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.
1815	Unfortunately, the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn around the revised draft.
1815	I'm still working on it.
1816	Jennifer McQuade called again to see if we had contacted Elzear Lemieux at counterparty re: comments to an NDA.
1816	If you haven't, his direct no.
1816	is
1817	David, The link is at the bottom of this email.
1818	When you have a minute to review this, can we meet so you can handle this response to Anthony.
1818	Thanks.
1819	When you get back into the office, can we visit about updating the ENA resolutions re: confirmation signatories.
1819	I think we need to clean out some of the data in the Corporate Database re: confirmation signatories.
1819	Thanks!
1820	Fred, Per our conversation, this link will get you access into the Master Swap Agreement database, where you can look up the status of any master agreement.
1820	If you have some time, why don't you take a look at it and see if your group would find this helpful.
1821	Cute!
1822	A few news flashes re: limitations on products: 1.
1822	The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina counterparties.
1822	They have licensing requirements similar to US physical power.
1822	All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut down for this product.
1822	2.
1822	Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties.
1823	David, This ETA is for ClickPaper.
1824	Am trying to get copies of the executed NDA's for the counterparties listed below.
1824	When you get this can you call me....
1825	At Brent's request, I am sending you the memo below.
1826	When we can get a copy of this, we need to make sure it's broad enough to cover what you're doing...
1827	Christian Yoder is looking for the course material for some of the in-house derivatives seminars.
1827	Does anyone have some material we can lend him?
1828	I extend my begrudging congratulations....
1829	Looks OK for me.
1830	We are going to be trading with Deutsche Bank out of their New York and London branch offices online.
1830	Per my conv.
1830	w/the online team, we going to have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we haven't solved multibranch customers online).
1830	With Edmund out, I need someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA Master with.
1830	Can you have someone there send me the docs.
1830	Much thanks...
1831	We have received the originally executed Participant Agreements dated 10/13/00 between each of Enron North America Corp., Enron Canada Corp., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and the IntercontinentalExchange, LLC.
1831	Copies will be distributed.
1832	Thanks, I appreciate it!
1833	Just a note on Kaiser, the agreement we have in place has terrible credit, and Bill Bradford w/Credit refuses to trade under it.
1833	We are in the process of replacing it with another.
1834	What is the full name of Wabash?
1834	I'm working on a master now w/Wabash Valley Power Ass'n.
1835	FYI (p.s. I told him Bill hates Kaiser and we can't trade under it)
1836	Nony has the Mexico file.
1836	If it's anywhere it should be there.
1837	OK.
1838	I spoke to Ed Sacks in Credit re: AEP.
1838	We have an ISDA in place with AEP Energy Services, Inc. When they trade under that master they are trading for their own account.
1838	When they trade as American Electric Power Service Corporation they are actually trading as the service company for the family of utilities under their umbrella.
1838	So it's 2 different counterparties.
1839	We had the attached agreement executed by each of Enron North America, Enron Canada and Enron Power Marketing.
1840	Re: the below, we shouldn't be signing passwords any more for ENA, so I wanted to confirm with you that I should only be preparing this resolution for EOL...?
1841	Contacts: Massachusetts Electric Co. - Michael Hager, 508/421-7350 Navajo Tribal Utility Authority-Diana Dechilly, 520/729-6238
1842	The only online trading counterparty lists I am aware you see are the lists that originate from Houston Credit.
1842	London has their own lists of counterparties I never see.
1842	Do you think we need to get them to forward all lists with Japanese & Australian counterparties to you and Jane for approval?
1843	I haven't seen or heard anything on this...
1844	The above counterparty is a really old one that appears to have come online before we opened up financial power for trading.
1844	It appears they never got opened up when it came online.
1844	Can we add them to tomorrow's list to open them for financial power.
1844	Much thanks!
1845	My last notes on Denmark from Edmund were due diligence pending.
1845	What's the scoop on commodity derivatives, weather derivatives, credit derivatives, derivatives in general.
1845	Any restrictions on any other products?
1845	Thanks for your voicemail re: Enron Metals.
1845	I'll give you a call in the morning when I get in. I miss my Justy...
1846	For Massachusetts Electric Company and Navajo Tribal Utility Authority: you'll notice they want to trade power and we're shutting them down.
1846	Leslie has to call the counterparties and talk to them about their power status.
1846	They're not showing up on the FERC approved lists, so Leslie has to figure out how/if they can trade power.
1847	Yes!
1848	Thanks!
1849	How clever of you to notice that this was for paralegals.
1849	I didn't.
1849	No, we never have any coordinated gatherings.
1849	This may be a first!
1849	How are you?
1849	Did you have a good time on your Miami vacation?
1850	I have a bunch of NDA's coming thru, so I thought I'd send you an email: 1.
1850	Leslie drafted an NDA yesteeday with Proxicom, Inc. - I don't know if she ran it by you...
1850	3.
1850	Commerce One, Inc. 4.
1850	Exodus Communications, Inc. 5.
1850	Financial Settlement Matrix 8.
1850	Oracle Corporation 11.
1850	Sabre Corporation
1851	Did you ever speak to Gillian Johnson yesterday about the difference of these
1852	We have received the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement effective as of 11/1/00 by and among the referenced Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.
1852	Copies will be distributed.
1853	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 09/04/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.
1853	Copies will be distributed.
1854	Do you not want to hear about any NDA's?
1855	Thanks Kay!
1856	Primagaz Trading Paris is a French counterparty that had come thru London.
1856	Credit doesn't want them to trade US products.
1856	I've never looked at it before, so I had to treat it as a new cpy.
1857	Can you please contact Stephanie Panus with these request.
1857	I forwarded your other one on to her and she is handling.
1858	Yes, the attached is what we signed.
1859	The resolution giving Robert Cass and Sheri Thomas approval to execute Password Applications as agents and attorneys-in-fact has been executed effective 11/02/00.
1859	I will send a copy down to Frank Davis.
1859	The original goes into the Company's Minute Books maintained in the Corporate Secretary's Office on the 48th Floor.
1860	We have received the fully executed Information Services Agreement between Enron Net Works LLC and Kase and Company, Inc. dated 11/1/00.
1860	Copies will be distributed.
1861	Thanks
1862	Thanks Marie!
1863	This master agreement is with a U.S. subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (and contains a Hydro-Quebec guaranty).
1863	You might want to point this out to some of your traders who might be interested in trading under it.
1864	We just got the executed ISDA Master and guaranty in with the referenced counterparty, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (you may have noticed my email).
1864	The Counterparty wants to trade with us online immediately.
1864	Can we get them on as an amended counterparty on Monday's list, and can we get them opened to trade financial on Monday?
1865	Per Leslie Hansen, above counterparty will not be approved to trade power online.
1865	She said she spoke to counterparty and they are a distribution company and not FERC approved to sell power.
1865	So we will not change that profile.
1866	I am looking for the merger documents dated 12/30/99 wherein Devon Energy Corp. merged with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., and PennzEnergy Exploration and Production Company, L.L.C.
1866	If you've got a copy can you fax it to me via 646-3490.
1866	Thanks!
1867	Why do we have so many deals from Coral that need to be assigned?
1868	Can someone talk to Coral so I can get out of the business of assigning "oops" trades...
1869	Thanks, I appreciate it!
1870	Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority: Per Leslie, not a FERC approved counterparty.
1870	This cpy can have read-only access for US power products.
1870	Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested in trading power at this time, but will let her know when they are.
1870	She will have to follow up with them re: their FERC approved status at that time.
1871	We have received the fully executed Unanimous Written Consent of Managers of EnronOnline, LLC dated 11/6/00, effective as of 10/11/00, which appoints Amita Gosalia, Dale Neuner and Sheri Thomas as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of EOL.
1871	This resolution will expire one year from the date of its effectiveness.
1871	When you execute, please sign as "Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".
1871	The original will be filed in the minute book of EnronOnline maintained in the Corporate Secretary's Office on the 48th floor, and a copy will be provided to Lisa Lees and Amita Gosalia.
1872	We have received the executed Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated 10/31/00 between the referenced counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.
1872	Copies will be distributed.
1873	Are these physical, financial or both?
1874	Please try and open up HQ Energy Services ASAP.
1875	Gaylord Container is shut down by Credit, but it should be open, so it is going to come back thru as an amended counterparty.
1876	The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.
1876	We would like to open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give them some headroom on power.
1876	If you could let me know ASAP whether you have any issues.
1877	Enron North America Corp. has executed a Consent to Assignment dated 10/05/00 with respect to the Master Repurchase Agreement dated 01/22/97 between ENA and Goldman Sachs Canada (a limited partnership), wherein Goldman Sachs Canada has assigned its position in the agreement and transactions thereunder to Goldman Sachs Canada Inc. (a corporation).
1877	Copies of the consent will be distributed.
1878	Thanks for such a prompt response!
1879	Please add Mark Taylor to this training.
1879	He has put it on his calendar.
1880	I take it you signed off on this new product.
1880	It is pretty common that we just copy the profile for a similar product for the existing 1500-2000 counterparties.
1880	Let me know if you think this is a problem.
1881	OK w/me.
1881	Lisa Lees cc: Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: New EOL Product - Crude Oil Financial The product long description below will fall under the new product type USCrude Basis Swap.
1881	Credit (Tom Moran) has approved copying the profiles forthe new product type from the following: US WTI Fin Swap Please respond by 10 a.m. on Wednesday, November 8.
1881	Thank you.
1882	OK for me.
1883	OK for me.
1884	OK for me.
1885	Sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power...!
1886	Call Leslie Hansen at x36121.
1886	She is a lawyer and will be able to help you.
1886	I am a paralegal that assists her.
1887	I haven't heard anything back from you re: this approval.
1887	The EOL people need a sign off ASAP.
1888	I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC license.
1888	He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up.
1889	I'm talking to their lawyer right now.
1889	He's checking with his power team to find out what name their FERC license is in. However, we still do not have a Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power Credit person to get me some headroom.
1889	Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as we speak!
1890	US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).
1890	There are some legal considerations with respect to certain products.
1890	In order to trade any financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.
1890	Otherwise, we have no problem with limited liability companies.
1891	Thanks for the good word!
1892	Can we open up ANP for gas ASAP.
1892	They have been dying to trade.
1892	They want to trade power but so far Credit has not given them any headroom for power and they do not appear to have a FERC license in this name.
1892	We are working with them trying to figure out how they can trade power.
1893	Coral Energy Holdings is where we have the financial master.
1893	Are you OK with this assignment?
1894	Can you please respond to Diane.
1894	Thanks.
1895	We do have an ISDA Agreement in place between Koch Energy Trading and ENA, but Anthony is correct on a number of accounts.
1895	First, we could not put Oslo trades under this master.
1895	It is a Local Currency form and could not be used for any non US transaction.
1895	Second, it is quite old and our forms have evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form.
1895	Lastly, it has the old "ERMS" style collateral annex, and we would want to use an ISDA Credit Support Annex on a going forward basis.
1895	I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson in London Legal and Rod Nelson in London Credit and getting a new master based off our current form.
1895	Tana Jones, Houston Legal
1896	A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the master with us and trade(s) thereunder.
1896	He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1.
1896	I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this trades, but you might want to give them a call.
1896	Jim McClymont at (308)
1897	At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for each of Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. and Amerex Power, Ltd. Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Bob at (713) 853-0397 if you have any comments or questions.
1898	Will attend.
1899	This counterparty is approved for all financial.
1900	Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline.
1900	By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of Thanks!
1901	I'm interested!
1901	Would it be OK to invite one of my new business people from London, she doesn't know anyone in Houston yet?
1902	We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't think we use it to trade under anymore.
1902	I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.
1902	If you concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get attached for online trading.
1903	Per my conv.
1903	w/Tanya, the above master should be inactived (which I have already done in Lotus Notes) and taken off the executed Master List.
1903	All the Dynegy Trading is done out of Dynegy Marketing and Trade.
1903	Thanks.
1904	Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.
1904	Is there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the middle of it.
1904	We've all lost our common sense and direction.
1904	It sure makes for good TV, though!
1904	I sat all last night flipping from news station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.
1904	I can't say I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.
1904	I've been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party system.
1904	That was a good thought.
1905	It's just you and me tomorrow.
1905	Soma is having furniture delivered from Star and they said they could only come between 8-12.
1905	So shall we drive together?
1905	Do you want to come to my house?
1905	At what time?
1906	Per our conv., above counterparty is OK to trade all products (except the usual credit deriv. & Argentina Gas).
1907	The scary thing about those old goats being too blind to vote is that they're still driving!
1908	Sounds good to me.
1908	I'll see you tomorrow am!
1909	Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents on the prepay.
1909	Can you send him a copy?
1909	Also, when they're all together, can you send a copy to me for our files.
1909	Thanks!
1910	Michael, thought you might enjoy this!
1911	Here's another spin on the election ballot!
1912	Just a note that the new bandwidth is still in EBS Legal being run thru the legal and regulatory hoops.
1912	As soon as I hear from Robbi or Marie that it's approved, I'll pass on the word.
1913	NYMEX is trying to get more competitive...
1914	Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of "Specified Entity".
1914	We have some concern that by adding certain Enron entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we are trying to carve those transactions out.
1914	Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.
1914	I checked with her and the FUNB agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised draft on 11/8/00.
1914	Sara's direct phone no.
1914	is 713/853-5620.
1915	I forwarded your agreement to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group, and she would prefer to work from our form if possible.
1915	Let me know if this is a problem.
1915	"John Nugent" Please respond to jnugent
1916	Jennifer McQuade with EOL called checking on the status of your conv.
1916	w/Elzear Lemieux with cpy.
1916	Have you resolved the ETA questions yet?
1917	I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he gets back in town, which is in two weeks.
1917	I hope that isn't going to cause any problems...
1918	At the request of Dovie Keprta in our eMarket Services Group, I am enclosing a draft of our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for David Endicott's review.
1918	I am also attaching a blacklined draft showing the changes from the NDA you executed with Enron Broadband Services.
1918	Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments you might have.
1918	We look forward to hearing from you.
1918	Tana Jones Senior Legal Specialist
1919	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Idea Integration Corp. (d/b/a Idea Integration) and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 11/9/00.
1919	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1920	Per my conv.
1920	w/cpy and Credit, please open the referenced counterparty to transact all financial.
1921	Will attend!
1922	We have received the following executed NDA's: Between Amerex Power, Ltd. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC Between Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1923	I just got them in today.
1923	I will fedex you a copy.
1923	Thanks for all your help!
1924	Attached is a current list of the NDA's I am working on for the EOL and Net Works teams.
1924	Please take the time to look at this list and confirm the status of any NDA's you are interested in.
1925	My favorite election comment to date comes from Gore who said today he was not "focused on the contest, but our democracy".
1925	Such a thoughtful, selfless person!
1926	For this list of amends, my comments mean: Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should have no impact on my prior approvals.
1926	Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas) Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's changes.
1927	Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.
1927	We have a note in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 4/6/2000.
1927	Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name change.
1927	Thanks.
1928	I'll leave you a check tomorrow.
1928	Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to meet the stove repair guy.
1928	Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean up day?
1929	The big switch here is that we're shutting Public Service Electric and Gas Commpany for power.
1929	All their power will be traded out of PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC.
1930	Perfect, it had another meeting scheduled for 3:30 I had to attend!
1931	Can you email me your form?
1931	How about lunch today?
1932	Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services Company?
1932	If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial master executed under Calpine Power Services.
1932	Can you fax it to me at 713/636-3490.
1932	Thanks!
1933	You are the best!
1934	If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of America, shouldn't your spreadsheet reflect that name?
1934	I'm confused.
1935	So, back to my original question, is this a name change?
1936	I will be taking Friday p.m.
1936	off to meet stove repair guy & contractor.
1937	Yeah!
1937	Also, I spoke to Dalzenia and she is going to move that dirt around by the fence.
1938	Can you fax me the merger documents to 646-3490.
1938	Thanks!
1939	Anyone have these merger docs?
1940	But I did respond.
1940	I said "yeah!"
1940	on the thermostat.
1940	You're confusing me...I don't know where Michelle is.
1940	She should be in town.
1940	She must just be busy at work.
1941	Now don't be afraid to tell us what you really think...!
1942	As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of the paralegals in the financial trading group: We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie Panus.
1942	Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron Broadband.
1942	Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group: Tana Jones: Primarily all EnronOnline issues.
1942	(1) I am the primary Legal contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.
1942	Individual contract problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.
1942	(2) As my time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with my name on, feel free to call me.
1942	Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions: Can be directed to any of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.
1942	Copies of Executed Masters: Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, she can get you copies.
1942	Merger/Name Changes: Stephanie Panus Executed Master List: Susan Bailey I hope this straightens things out!
1943	This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.
1943	We have received documentation that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.
1943	Is Credit OK with this merger?
1944	I am sending down this list, with all counterparties approved except Calpine, which I am still waiting on Credit approval on the Calpine Power Services/Energy Services merger.
1944	As soon as I get their sign off I will send down an amended spreadsheet.
1945	Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State effective 11/1/00, Calpine Power Services Company, a California corporation has been merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., a Delaware corporation.
1945	The ISDA Master Agreement with Calpine Power Services Company dated 10/20/99 will be changed accordingly.
1946	Nope, it's a merger.
1947	Here's that email of "Bushism's".
1948	I just can't help myself!
1949	I believe that this was authored by James Carville: NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series.
1949	The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today.
1949	They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union.
1949	"We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach.
1949	"We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."
1949	One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.
1949	It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches.
1949	Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.
1949	"The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the Mets batting coach.
1949	"The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game.
1949	"While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the commissioner said.
1949	Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.
1949	"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman.
1949	"The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.
1949	He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment."
1950	Attached is the revised list giving Calpine Energy Services the same approval as Calpine Power Services (except no Argentina gas).
1951	Bandwidth now OK per Marie.
1951	She should have GTC to you no later than noon tomorrow.
1952	No, we don't currently have Alberta Prepay docs.
1952	Greg has finally gotten them all and is preparing sets.
1953	Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross numbers to match my list: "Net long or short position in all months combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, with the positions not netted out.
1954	At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.
1954	P.S.
1954	Do we have any particular deadline for getting them approved?
1954	Thanks!
1955	You guys crack me up!
1956	Heck, we all know sending an agreement out for signature doesn't mean getting them back signed.
1956	If we had every agreement signed we sent out, we'd be at
1957	Jay, this one is from one of our London lawyers to me and a Canadian lawyer.
1958	These last two were especially good.
1958	I guess the best thing about this mess is that it has provoked such good humor!
1959	You guys are cracking me up.
1959	I had tears streaming down my face this morning!
1959	(hey, but I thought y'all played "American Football" too, maybe I'm confused).
1960	At the request of Leslie Hansen, I am enclosing a clean and redlined draft of the revised NDA.
1961	We have received the fully executed Confidential Nondisclosure Agreement dated 11/13/00 between Sapient Corporation and Enron Net works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.
1961	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1962	Can you please direct one of the paralegals to assist Angeline with getting this documentation in place.
1962	I thought Susan would be appropriate because she handles internal masters, but I understand she is only responsible for RMT Masters.
1963	I told the online people I had to shut them down for power because we didn't have them on any FERC lists.
1963	Below is their ph.
1963	# (when you get a minute!).
1964	I have passed your request to Mark Taylor to assign to another paralegal.
1964	I no longer handle the day to day swap work, I am working on Online predominately now.
1964	By copy of this email, I will ask Mark to let you know what paralegal he has assigned this to.
1965	RUSH BELOW.
1966	This counterparty is approved for all products except power and Argentina gas (no credit deriv too).
1967	(g) Additional Event of Default.
1967	The following will constitute an additional Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a): (ix) (i) in the case of Party A, if Enron Corp. ceases to own, directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party A having ordinary voting power; or (ii) in the case of Party B, if Enron Corp. ceases to own directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) or more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party B having ordinary voting power.
1968	We only send this to the legal team that follows, not the distribution that Brad sends it to.
1969	What do you think?
1970	On First Energy, we originally had them open for financial and shut down for power, no change to that earlier approval.
1971	I thought this might be helpful.
1972	Thanks Justy, you're the best!
1973	All the counterparties below can trade physical, and only the two I've marked below in red can trade financial.
1974	Just a reminder, starting today until I get back after the holidays, send the counterparty approval lists to my assistant Taffy Milligan, and she will forward them to the Legal team, so they can be working on their approvals while I'm gone.
1975	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/20/00 between the referencec Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.
1975	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
1976	FYI
1977	With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement. Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue. With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review. Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.
1978	Can you please give Greg Johnston, Peter Keohane and Mark Powell, lawyers in our Calgary office, as well as their assistants Linda Sietzema and Sharon Crawford, full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreements database.
1978	Can you please let me know when their access has been granted.
1978	Thanks!
1979	Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.
1979	Mark says that even though we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.
1979	I think I might need to talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.
1979	Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you about potential metals customers?
1979	Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?
1979	Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?
1979	Do you know when he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?
1980	As usual, you're the best!
1981	On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).
1981	It helps me and some of the non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..
1981	Thanks!
1982	On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.
1982	If we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.
1982	For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them open for all financial except Australian power.
1982	(Also, shutting down Argentina gas...)
1983	This link should be ok.
1984	Thanks Lisa!
1985	FYI
1986	Not wanting to duplicate any efforts, I think Laurie Meyer, a paralegal in Alan Aronowitz's group, is going to send me copies of the Australian ISDA's when they come in. Thanks for the offer!
1987	I don't know who is going to work on this one, but I just wanted to remind you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the TVA...
1988	I was just speaking to Ed Sacks, and he asked if we could add a new Credit person to our distribution lists, Wendy Conwell, who will be working with Ed on the power counterparties.
1988	Her ext.
1988	is 30699.
1989	I checked with Sara, and Thursday at 2:30 pm is OK with us.
1989	Just let us know if the time changes.
1989	Should we come to Bill's office?
1990	Matt, Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have (like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.): Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals) Weather Derivatives Credit Derivatives Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?
1990	I am going to attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products we trade.
1990	Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in Singapore?
1990	For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc. Thanks!
1991	Thanks for the heads up.
1991	Let me know when you need help...
1992	My copy had redlines.
1992	I passed the comments on to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our Group for review.
1993	Sara, is there a reason I'm being sent this?
1994	Will do.
1994	Thanks for the heads up!
1995	Matt, As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all products.
1995	I am asking because until recently I have not been approving Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.
1995	It has been my understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading physical products.
1995	I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.
1995	Should that be my continuing practice?
1996	I've made my flight reservations home for XMAS, and they should only have me out Friday, Dec. 22.
1996	My flight returns very early on the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 27, so if there are no delays I should be in the office late sometime that morning.
1997	Will do!
1998	Can you please add my assistant, Taffy Milligan, on for full edit access to the referenced database.
1998	Can you also delete Shari Stack from edit capability, as she is no longer in our group.
1998	Also, can you provide me a list of the individuals with full edit access.
1998	I need to check to see if there are other people that have left our group or legal and credit that should be taken off.
1998	Thanks!
1999	Hey, Mr. Computer, you can't log an email in to your sister?!
2000	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/29/00 with the referenced counterparty.
2000	A copy will be provided to Dovie.
2001	I just spoke to Tanya and she was going for either (1) Bloomberg published a report that said energy supply was going to be low for the next couple of years, or (2) the California thing.
2001	She hadn't heard the Energizer bunny story.
2002	Just an update, Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, will be working on the Confirmation, her direct no.
2002	is x34737, and Stephanie Panus, another paralegal in our group, will be working on the ISDA Master, her no is x53249.
2002	When you have that address and contact information ready for the counterparty, why don't you email it directly to Stephanie.
2002	If I can be of further help, just let me know!
2003	No problem, always happy to help!
2004	Please note: we are intermediary on a deal we are structuring between Interliant and PurchasePooling, so we have added them as a party to receive the confidential information.
2004	If you work off this form you would, of course, want to strike the reference to PurchasePooling in Paragraph 5.
2005	It was good to hear from you!
2005	We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.
2005	It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.
2005	It was good having the girls down.
2005	We played a new version of Uno called "African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.
2005	It's not for the meek.
2005	It was incredible what a good player Alena was.
2005	She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!).
2005	I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.
2005	I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.
2005	Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff.
2005	They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment.
2005	So he's going to have to start looking for another place.
2005	And his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby.
2005	I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby.
2005	You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.
2005	The upstairs "guest suite" is pretty neat.
2005	It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.
2005	As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice.
2005	It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.
2005	But, I guess, it's a start...
2005	I've already made my XMAS plans.
2005	I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.
2005	It's good chatting with you.
2005	Keep in touch!
2006	You can take my assistant Taffy Milligan off these emails again.
2006	Thanks!
2007	Attached is the referenced agreement.
2007	Let me know if the notice information is OK with you.
2007	If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature.
2007	Thinking about that, what's your title?
2007	I'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...
2008	No, it does not mean that.
2008	Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement.
2008	Our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component.
2009	I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're OK.
2010	The referenced counterparty has applied in London for a password application.
2010	Can you let me know if this presents any problems for each of your trading groups products?
2010	Thanks!
2011	FYI, I understand from our natural gas people that they do not like the EnergyGateway form of GTC and want to transact on their platform with only counterparties where we have a master agreement in place.
2012	I've got some changes to make to that assignment and then I'm ready to send it to them.
2012	Do you have a contact for me to send it to?
2013	Will the LME transactions go under a relevant financial master, if any, or will they always be standalone under the GTC?
2014	Anthony, We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other parties, including, other Enron affiliates.
2014	All requests by non-Enron North America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to the paralegals in the Swap Group to determine if the agreement will allow us to provide copies to such affiliate, or whether we would need counterparty approval to do so.
2014	With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and let you know whether they present any problem.
2015	Thanks, I'll fax it over to her today!
2016	Does Dr. Batsell's company have a name?
2017	FYI, Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.
2017	He also discussed proposed credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in place (including EnronCredit.com).
2017	I think we are done now and hope to get execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.
2017	Our intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the remaining masters quickly.
2017	I'll keep you posted.
2018	We're going to have a Legal happy hour tomorrow at the Blue Agave, and it would be no party without you there.
2018	Hope you can make it (and ask any of your buddies in Legal you want to ask!).
2019	Please forward this to 70 of your closest friends...
2020	We do have a Credit Support Annex in place.
2020	Once we sign the ENA agreement, we will make your requests to DB.
2021	Another good one!
2022	Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot transact US physical power.
2022	On the financial side, we just got an ISDA Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).
2022	We will only consider those on a case by case basis.
2022	Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a "governmental".
2022	No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.
2022	All other US products appear to be OK.
2023	It was making me sleepy just looking at it!
2024	See if this works...
2025	We have received the following fully executed documents back from 1.
2025	Provider Agreement dated 12/04/00.
2025	This Agreement provides that the Monthly Membership Fee of $1,500 shall be waived for the first six months of the contract, starting November 30, 2000 thru May 31, 2001.
2025	2.
2025	Natural Gas Marketplace General Terms and Conditions dated 11/30/00.
2025	A copy will be sent to Sheri Thomas and Craig Breslau.
2026	A woman named Janette Bertel at McLaren Energy just left a message for Genia who had just sent them a power master, that they also want to get an ISDA Master in place with us.
2026	The woman's phone no is 819/986-4616.
2026	If you could send up some credit for this, we'd appreciate it!
2027	The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.
2027	It appears their Credit guy didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before they send a revised draft.
2027	Further, he said all changes have to be sent to Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!
2028	For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.
2028	Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).
2028	Unlike the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, Team Swap is looking strong.
2029	My strategy on hand recounts, is that if if the opposition wants one, they'll have to do it themselves!
2030	Justin & Matt, Beth Cowan is a member here of the EnronOnline Marketing Team.
2030	Her Counterparty, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, would like to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ECTRIC (per Beth, they don't like our form of GTC).
2030	We already have a Local Currency form in place with ENA, but obviously, that would not be an appropriate form for London to use.
2030	It is also on our form of Schedule from 1996, which we wouldn't want to work off of either.
2030	In addition, I've checked the Confidentiality Provisions, and they do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent.
2030	Saying all that, could you please help Beth out...
2031	Who is Robert Mcgrory?
2031	Is he a member of the Legal Dept?
2032	With respect to your request: 1.
2032	I take it "ECTRL" is the Master Agreement between ECTRIC and ENA.
2032	All the internal masters are kept in Houston.
2032	I will send you a copy.
2032	2.
2032	Moravske Naftove is an agreement that London Legal got in place.
2032	We do not have copies here, I suggest you contact Matt Dawson to get a copy.
2032	3.
2032	Risk Mangement & Trading/ECTRIC-I will send you a copy.
2032	4.
2032	State Street Bank, as Trustee/ECTRIC-this was for the Cash VI Project and is not for general trading purposes.
2032	I will send copies to you.
2032	5.
2032	Elf Trading S.A./ECTRIC-London Legal should have copies.
2032	Contact Matt Dawson
2033	At the request of George Zivic, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
2033	Please call me at 713/853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel, at 713/835-6121 if you have any comments or questions.
2034	The meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm to discuss netting between the physical and financial contracts will be held in Bill Bradford's office.
2035	Matt and Denis, Can you help us with this NDA we need executed for an EnronCredit.
2035	meeting on Monday?
2035	If you could print it out on EnronCredit.com letterhead and have Denis initial it for signature.
2035	Because of time, Leslie can't initial this before we execute it, but we promise she will initial it before we send it out to the customer.
2035	Then, can you have it executed by an officer of EnronCredit.com and return it to me at fax nol 713/646-3490.
2035	Thanks for your help!
2036	I see you two are on the Reliant agreement.
2036	Deedy Russo, who is manager of contracts at Reliant, asked if we could contact them about getting an ISDA Master in place to replace the old ERMS Agreement.
2036	She siad we should contact Janna Lynn Galloway, a paralegal there.
2036	Her number is 713/207-5893.
2037	It is in Mark Taylor's hands.
2037	Unfortunately, he is out sicke
2038	This is a Mark Taylor Question.
2039	We have received an executed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Analytica, Inc. and Enron Net Works, LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.
2039	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels and Kal Shah.
2040	We have lots of ISDA's in place with "Southerns", "Southern" who?
2041	We have an ISDA Master Agreement (Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction) in place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P. I am a little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services Agreement.
2041	Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade.
2041	If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.
2042	Any thoughts on how you would like to approach this?
2043	I would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the ISDA Master Agreement we recently executed with this Counterparty to limit their financial trading to energy commodity trading only.
2043	This counterparty is NOT approved to trade any other products including , but not limited to, weather, pulp & paper, plastics, steel, metals, interest rate & currency, fx, or credit derivatives.
2044	I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade European physical power products.
2044	They have licensing requirements similar to our FERC licensing.
2044	Thanks!
2045	So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm.
2045	Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.
2045	I think it would be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions.
2045	Dinner sounds good to me....
2046	Oops, already had to make change!
2047	Can she get it wrong twice within 1 minute?
2047	The answer is YES!
2048	For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not want that to change.
2048	I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting them down for physical gas.
2049	Are you there.
2049	I tried calling and no one picked up.
2049	I'm ready to go...
2050	ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power L.P. Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.
2050	Could the trades be done under that master?
2050	Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in place.
2051	I haven't done anything.
2051	I was waiting for you to get back in to discuss this...
2052	My new address is: 1920 Banks St., Houston 77098.
2052	I would love to come to your dinner party!
2053	Yep, we had a nice time.
2053	I tried calling you about 4:00 yesterday, but there was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go.
2054	What's the scoop on getting this signed?
2055	Thanks!
2056	I sent you the regular online approval by mistake.
2056	Below are clickpaper.
2057	Per our conversation.
2057	1.
2057	Replace front outdoor light fixture.
2057	2.
2057	Add door numbers to bottom of front door (1920 Banks).
2057	3.
2057	Add door knocker to middle of front door (cute kitty door knocker!).
2057	4.
2057	Replace light in front sunroom with new light.
2057	5.
2057	Fix window in back sunroom so it locks or closes (I'm afraid it would be easy to pry open, and we have had recent robberies in neighborhood).
2058	Attached is another NDA we need to get signed ASAP.
2058	If you could help us with this, we'd appreciate it!
2059	Sure, I'll take care of it!
2060	The referenced Counterparty wants to trade physical power.
2060	Leslie has signed off on them from a Legal standpoint, but Credit still has concerns and has assigned them no power headroom.
2060	I spoke to Jeff Mansfield in their Legal Dept. and he is going to have his Credit guy call Ed Sacks tomorrow.
2061	Tana will attend.
2062	With respect to the trade done today with Gases y Graneles Liquidos S.A., please find attached a Chilean Annex A for an Omnibus form of confirmation.
2062	Please attach this form and make an election for NY law as the choice of law.
2062	Along with the fax of the Confirmation to the Counterparty, please also fax a form of IRS Form W-8BEN and ask the Counterparty to complete the form and return it to us.
2062	Craig, can you talk to the Counterparty and make sure they send us back the tax form?!
2063	Per the email below, this has been approved.
2063	I had to revise the attached copy to fix the header and page break, so use the copy I sent you.
2063	Thanks for your help!
2064	Can I sent a copy of this down to Credit?
2064	How about Joe Hunter?
2065	As we discussed, I am attaching our proposed form of Bilateral and Enron Protected Party Non-Disclosure Agreements.
2065	Please direct any comments you may have to Mark Greenberg at x58897.
2065	We appreciate your help with this!
2066	I would, I will contribute $25.
2066	I have to walk over to the bank to get some cash.
2067	At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a clean and redlined copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement revised to include your comment.
2067	If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have the agreement executed and return a copy to me via fax no.
2067	(713) 646-3490.
2067	I will then have it executed by Enron and return a copy to you via fax.
2068	Whatever Tom decides to mirror these two new products from, ditto from me!
2069	Ditto Tom.
2070	Ditto Tom.
2071	Attached is my proposed form of Amendment, which would delete the old style "ERMS" Collateral Annex and replace it with an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
2071	Tanya, please take a look at the stairstep, and the segregation of collateral provisions.
2072	Sure!
2073	Can you please send me a copy of the fully executed NDA for our files.
2073	Thanks!
2074	You can come up to our area here on 38 and reveiw any contracts you would like.
2074	We are located directly in front on the glass doors on 38.
2075	Taffy, can you please copy these masters for Carrie ASAP.
2075	Thanks.
2076	I just left you both another message about this NDA.
2076	Their lawyer is calling from NY, and we need it signed now.
2076	His name is Robert Harris, his ph is 212/984-9112 and his fax is 212/984-9111.
2077	Did you draft this?
2078	Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of law and arbitration language in it.
2078	I send it with a caveat that this draft is 2 years old.
2078	The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the choice of law or arbitration language.
2079	Derek, I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex A-Chile".
2079	When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch.
2080	Susan Bailey in our Group sends out this list.
2080	Your should direct your request to her.
2080	Thanks!
2081	Please find attached our proposed Second Amendment, which would replace the current form of collateral annex attached to the ISDA Master Agreement we have in place with an ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto.
2081	If you have any questions or comments concerning the form please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-5620.
2081	Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Dept. can handle any credit questions you have.
2081	Her number is (713) 853-3263.
2081	Thanks for your prompt attention to this.
2082	With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company, although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather, Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in them would prohibit this type of transaction.
2082	Can you contact whomever sent you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of Association to us.
2082	Thanks!
2083	Link -->
2084	Attached please find Annex B for Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund deals nos.
2084	QD7357.1 and QE0910.2.
2085	Just a note to Group after discussion w/paralegals and Mark: on a going forward basis if our counterparty is a hedge fund, we will ask for all corporate documents, plus a copy of their prospectus (which should show us what the fund is allowed to invest in).
2086	Shawna and I are both sitting here so excited to get your note.
2086	Are we available?
2086	For Chapman?
2086	Of course!!!
2086	Shawna's answer is...both nights, many festive drinks!
2086	We are only limited by the thought of choosing just one night over the other!
2086	If we have to, we will.
2086	We leave the choice to you, because we are available either night...
2087	Just one note.
2087	I have a typo in your company name in the address, it needs an "r".
2087	Fax it back to me at 713/646-3490 and I will get it signed by Enron.
2087	Thanks for such a quick response!
2088	Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for sending out NDA's.
2088	When you need an NDA, please email me the following information.
2088	I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our NDA's to check for conflicts.
2088	Once we've done that I will prepare and send out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.
2088	Once it is fully executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the central gatekeeper of all NDA's.
2088	My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything.
2089	If you think the attached would be helpful to any members of your group, please pass it on to them...
2090	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Excambria, Inc. and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 12/14/00.
2090	A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.
2091	We hav received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between PVM Oil Associates Limited and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 12/12/00.
2091	A copy will be sent to Bob Shults and Dave Samuels.
2092	My understanding of this NDA is that London gave it directly to Craig Chaney to get executed by the counterparty.
2092	So, David, I think you need to get a copy from Craig, and then forward a copy on to me.
2093	How did it get to be that these people are drafting their own NDA's.
2093	I thought our agreement when we met with Dovie Keptra was that I would draft them.
2093	I would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've changed.
2094	I ran this by Leslie, and she has no problem, so go ahead and send it out to your customer.
2094	If you could please keep us in the loop on the status of any negotiations or execution...Thanks!
2095	Attached is a current list of the NDA's we are/have worked on for your groups.
2095	Please take the time to review this list and confirm the status of any NDA's you are interested in.
2096	We do not appear to have received your fax of the NDA.
2096	Can you please fax it to my attention at 713/646-3490 and I will distribute it to the members of the Enron Team.
2096	Thanks!
2097	Thanks!
2098	Per Leslie's email please open FPC for all US power ASAP.
2099	Nope, I'm going to need someone to do approvals that week after XMAS...
2100	There is some misunderstanding.
2100	I still have not received the fax of the NDA.
2100	Did you have it to my attention, Tana Jones, at fax no.
2100	713/636-3490?
2101	I've got it now, thanks Robert!
2102	We have received the faxed copy of the fully executed NDA dated 12/13/00 with the referenced Counterparty.
2102	I will send a copy to David Dupre, Matt Dawson in London for the UK files, and Kay Young for the Houston files and database.
2102	Thanks to everyone for their help!
2103	As we discussed, attached is the LOI revised to make some typographical type changes.
2104	Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to the following people: Anita Fam Brenda Whitehead Elizabeth Sager Jason Peters Stephanie Sever Christian Yoder Lorraine Filomeno Shari Stack Susan Flynn Lisa Lees Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments): Tom Moran and Veronica Espinoza.
2104	Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit access: Cheryl Nelson.
2104	Thanks!
2105	Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho Credit didn't have them marked as such.
2105	Kimball, I am ok with the change adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, and no change there.
2105	Bay State was previously shut down for financial and power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.
2105	The Energy Authority, I had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.
2105	Now, per Leslie, have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.
2105	Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I am shutting them down for all financial.
2106	Per your request, attached is the "BETA" Agreement.
2106	Mark also thought Bob might want the Broker Fee Agreement.
2107	Has Mark given this to anyone to work on?
2108	We have several ISDA with Lehman Brothers.
2108	Attached is an Icon that will allow you to view the Financial Trading Agreement Database, which all the Legal Dept., including the London Legal Dept. should use to track their financial master agreements.
2108	Matt Dawson know how to use this database, if you need to visit with him.
2108	Link --> By copy of this email to Mike Neves, I am requesting that you be granted full edit access to this database (Mike, Denis is a lawyer from London).
2109	FYI I will be out of the office after lunch today and will return 12/27/00.
2109	Have a good holiday!
2110	Per Peter's voicemail, there is no standard ISDA form of parent guaranty.
2110	I have attached the standard Enron Corp. and Counterparty guaranties we request under and ISDA Master, as Peter requested.
2111	We have received a fax of the fully executed NDA from London.
2111	I am having a copy walked down to Gillian.
2112	I spoke to the traders on the West Desk, and "EPMI Long Term California" should be documented as Enron Power Marketing, Inc. "Long Term California" is just a book on the West Desk
2113	No action is required by Legal on above list.
2114	Thank you, I got your fax and have forwarded it down to my Online Team for signature.
2114	As soon as I get it back signed, I will fax a copy back to you.
2114	Bill Lane Please respond to "wtl@tradewellsystems.com"
2115	Richard, Below is the resume of a friend of George Hope, a member of the Online Team.
2115	As head of legal recruiting, if it meets the needs of any particular group, please pass it on.
2116	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC and the referenced Counterparty dated 12/28/00.
2116	Copies will be distributed.
2117	Dave, Per your conversation with Mark last week, it appears the Confirmation Desk people are still waiting for the "oops trade" language.
2118	Why do I keep getting these new products for approval?
2119	Someone must be cleaning out their office, because a notice of a restructuring from Black Stone Holdings Parnership mysteriously showed up on my desk, with no note.
2119	I have no idea if Credit knows about this BECAUSE IT IS SO OLD!
2119	The notice dated 4/19/99, says effective 7/1/98, Black Stone Holdings Partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Black Stone Minerals Company L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership.
2119	Let me know whether or not Credit knew about this already...if not, I'll send a copy down to you.
2119	It was my understanding from way back when that they were no longer trading under the Blackstone financial master, so this may be moot.
2119	If we are trading with them again, we never did get the corporate documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an excuse to get them.
2120	As you requested...
2121	I just got a call from Deutsche Bank a minute ago, and they got approval from Frankfurt and are overnighting the agreement to me for signature.
2121	I'll keep you posted...
2122	We have two new lawyers that have joined our Group today: Francisco Pinto-Leite and Frank Sayre.
2122	They will need access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2122	In addition, I am still waiting to hear that Cheryl Nelson has been granted access to the Financial Trading Database.
2122	Can you let me know what the scoop is...?
2122	Also, I left you a message this morning about my new database for online documents...when can we expect a roll out of that?
2122	People keep sending me documents and I have no place to record them...
2122	Thanks, as usual for your help!
2123	Per Tanya's comments at our Legal/Credit Meeting yesterday, I would like to have the referenced counterparty come thru again to shut them down for financial trading.
2123	Per Tanya, all financial trading for the Calpine family should be done out of Calpine Energy Services, L.P.
2124	Attached is the form of NDA for distribution to your customer.
2125	Carol, Susan is out today.
2125	Is what you want just a full set of the ISDA documents?
2125	Do you need a binder of our internal forms as well?
2125	I have a bunch of trainees coming thru so Taffy just made up a bunch of new sets of ISDA documents and is 3 hole punching them and putting them in the binders...Do you want them messengered out to your home, or just available for you when you get back to the office?
2126	I knew that, I must've had a brain drain!
2127	As you requested, I am attaching our form of Bilateral NDA for the Enron Networks Group.
2127	Please remember that all Counterparty specific drafts must be prepared by Legal.
2128	Bad news.
2128	We got the Deutsche Bank documents in and they weren't signed by them yet, and none of the supporting documentation was provided.
2128	So, I think we are going to be on the longer side of the execution timetable vs. the shorter side...
2129	You're relentless...!!!
2130	You are too good to me!
2131	The person we are dealing with is very nice, Stephen Kessler, their lawyer out of New York.
2131	He has been very helpful.
2131	We just don't know how long it will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop.
2131	Our intention is to fedex the ISDA out to Steve tonight.
2131	The Enron Guaranty will take a little more time, so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later, so we can keep the ISDA moving.
2132	Can we open them up?

2137	We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.

2137	Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed.
2138	Please add if you don't already have her...
2139	Sounds good to me!
2139	I only wish I could bill by the hour the time I have spent today straightening out issues raised by this El Paso thing!!!
2140	Attached is the BETA and Fee Agreement for NatSource.
2140	Let me know if they meet with your approval.
2141	OK for me!
2142	Yes, there will be different legal/jurisdictional issues.
2142	I'm going to have to run this by an attorney familiar w/Japan.
2142	I'll get back to you...
2143	We have a Counterparty on the 1/5/01 List, Accenture LLP that we need to approve immediately.
2143	Can you let me know ASAP whether you have any problems with this counterparty.
2144	The above counterparty is approved for all products, except physical power (and the usual!).
2145	Attached are the BETA's and Fee Agreements for: Power Merchants Group, Amerex Power and Amerex Natural Gas.
2145	Please let me know what your thoughts are...
2146	Just as I suspected.
2146	I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal course of business.
2147	EnronOnline, not Enron Net Works, entered into a NDA with the Enron Gas Pipeline Group.
2147	Would you like a copy of it.
2148	No Japanese connection...
2149	Are we missing any Japanese counterparties?
2150	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Allegro Development Corporation and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 01/08/01.
2150	Copies will be distributed.
2151	I am unable to send you those DynegyDirect docs because my file is missing.
2151	I have tried unsuccessfully to locate it, so I am contacting the Online Team right now trying to get copies from them.
2151	As soon as I get copies I will get you copies.
2152	Per our earlier agreements with the Online Team, this counterparty is a division and I will not open them up to trade until the incorporated entity is part of the counterparty name.
2152	Our financial contract is set up as "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".
2153	Please mirror what Tom is doing...
2154	Teresa Mandola with the EnronOnline Team has received a call from the TVA.
2154	They would like to start trading physical power online with us immediately and would like to see a copy of the Enabling Agreement they have in place for power.
2154	Can someone from the power team provide this to them.
2154	Teresa's number is x39807.
2154	Thanks!
2155	can you send me the deal terms like we've done before so I can prepare an assignment.
2155	Thanks!
2156	I'm passing this on to you for review.
2157	I am faxing the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex to you.
2157	I sent a copy to you a few days ago.
2157	I hope you should get it shortly.
2158	What do you think about this?
2159	Who is Mike Bridges?
2160	I checked the agreements and we can provide you with copies of both of these, so I am having them copies right now and will be faxing them to you this a.m.
2161	Per my earlier email, are we trying to get Koch Hydrocarbon Co. changed to reflect the legal entity as part of the counterparty name?
2162	Mark Taylor asked me to contact you about the referenced NDA.
2162	He said you were the lawyer for Dealbench.
2162	I'm a paralegal that works with Mark, and we got a call from a member of the Online Team, Dave Samuels, who said that "a lawyer" was working on an NDA for Dealbench, and he wanted to confirm that the agreement reflected Enron Net Works, not Dealbench, as the Enron counterparty.
2162	Is this something you are working on and familiar with?
2162	If so, can you provide me with a copy of what you are working on?
2162	We appreciate your help!
2163	Nora, That you for such a prompt response.
2163	We appreciate it!
2164	I don't think I need to be included on these emails about the bandwidth master contracts...
2165	Attached is the proposed form of LOI for Prebon.
2165	Is Prebon Energy the full legal name of the company?
2166	On the attached list: CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company: Credit is opening them up for Can & US gas, which I am fine with.
2166	I already had them open for financial.
2166	Make sure they're shut down for physical power.
2166	Westpac: I just approved that one on the 1/5/01 list.
2166	There should be no changes from that list.
2166	Enron Australia has an ISDA Master in place with them, as does ENA, so we are OK with them transacting all financial, including all Australia financial.
2167	Oops, I sent you the form, not the prebon draft.
2168	Legal has no problems with the amended counterparties on Credit's list of
2169	Jeff, This is a physical deal which needs an assignment prepared.
2170	What's Bobbie's last name?
2171	Are you drafting this NDA for us?
2171	I have already prepared a draft based off your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our counterparty.
2171	In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we have arbitration in all of our agreement.
2171	Our client over at EnronOnline, Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.
2172	Mark Greenberg, and attorney in our Group, has reviewed your comments and made some minor changes.
2172	If these changes meet with you approval, please fax a signed copy of the agreement to me at fax no.
2172	(713) 646-3490 and I will, in turn, have it executed by Enron.
2172	If you need to talk to me about the changes please call me at (713) 853-3399.
2172	Mark is out of the office today, but will return Tuesday.
2172	If you need to talk to him, his direct dial no.
2172	is (713)
2173	Nora, I have a call into my business person.
2173	I ran what's going on by Mark Taylor (you know, I'm just a paralegal, Mark's a lawyer), and got his permission to exclude the arbitration language from the agreement.
2173	So I just wanted to run it by Dave, and then we're home free.
2173	Also, I don't know who you had lined up to sign, but Louise Kitchen has strict rules that I have to have someone from her group execute all their documents.
2173	Who would you get to sign?
2174	I spoke to Dave Samuels, and if you are having Harry Arora sign it, Dave thought that would be OK with Louise.
2174	So we're on board.
2174	Could you send me a copy when it's signed.
2174	Thanks for your help!
2175	Kimie got my last invitation.
2175	If we add more, I'll have to get more.
2176	No response is required from Legal for the 1/8/01 list.
2177	I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to First Energy Trading Services Inc. I do not have any documentation reflecting this merger.
2177	Do you?
2178	Cheryl, Please keep me on this list.
2178	I need to get it because on EnronOnline.
2178	Please take Susan Flynn off the list.
2178	She is no longer in our group, and I'm not sure if she's still with Enron.
2179	Sure, Just make sure that she has an updated book.
2179	Also, can you verify that my book is updated since we use it to make the other copies.
2179	Thanks.
2180	If Susan's not at the Company anymore, how can she ask to be taken off the list?
2181	Please send the documents to me at EB3802.
2181	Thanks!
2182	She was on long term leave for about 4 mos.
2182	and then has to reapply to get another job someone in Enron since her job was filled in our group.
2182	I heard she was back in the country, but I haven't heard whether she was going to come back to Enron or not.
2183	Nora, Have you got that signed NDA in yet?
2183	My business person, Dave Samuels is calling me about it...
2183	Thanks!
2184	At the request of Stephen Abbanat, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
2184	If you have any comments or questions you would like to discuss with me, do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 .
2184	If the NDA meets with your approval, please return a copy to me via fax no.
2184	(713) 646-3490.
2184	We look forward to hearing from you.
2185	We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between the referenced Counterparty and EnronOnline, LLC dated 12/22/00.
2185	Copies will be distributed.
2186	We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC dated 1/12/01.
2186	Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Nora Dobin.
2187	Thanks for your prompt help, I really appreciate it!
2187	I am currently creating a list of all the agreements I have or have heard of, so I hope to have something when you arrive tomorrow to review.
2188	I just received a copy of the executed agreement and am having a copy walked over to you.
2189	But you have all the others with your name attached?
2190	Dave Samuels thought I might want to confirm this with you.
2190	I have a copy of an MOU in my files with Aether, but no records of us having signed any agreements with them.
2190	Have you?
2191	Attached is a list of the EnronOnline documents I am aware of.
2191	Please let me know if there are any additional agreements that have not been included.
2191	I have bolded those documents I am still trying to obtain copies of (and the person who might be aware of them).
2191	If you have copies can you please provide them to me ASAP.
2191	Thanks for your help.
2192	Per John's request, I will be calling you about contracts below.
2193	Yep!
2194	Thanks Justy!!!
2195	No, I think I sent my email to the wrong online distribution group.
2196	I do have a copy of those.
2196	Please provide me with a copy of the new one when it's signed.
2196	Thanks for your help!
2197	As you requested, I am attaching our proposed form of NDA.
2197	Please keep us apprised of the status of the contract.
2198	With this, we're at 498!
2199	Paul, Are they going to fax me a copy of the signed agreement?
2200	Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the Atlantic?
2201	Also, if a Confidentiality Agreement was executed in connection with the VWD file, we would need to provide a copy of that too...
2202	We need to get the signed copy.
2203	I've heard about it, but I keep forgetting to check it out...!
2204	At the request of Ed Sacks, I am also attaching a sample form of Enron Corp. Guaranty.
2205	We need to get copies of the merger documents.
2205	Depending of the nature of the merger, we may or may not agree to it, as our document allows, and if we do, we need to determine the impact on our credit.
2205	Can you provide a copy to me and Tanya Rohauer in Credit as soon as we receive the merger documents.
2205	Thanks for the "head up".
2206	No one seems to know about the Proxicom documents and Dave Samuels in EOL said your worked on this.
2206	Is Proxicom ringing any bell with you?
2207	Thanks, Jim was the man!
2208	Anthony, I just spoke to the Entergy lawyer, and this merger isn't effective until 2/1/01.
2208	She will be sending me documents when they are filed with the Delaware Secretary of State.
2208	So you don't need to worry about this.
2209	Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline contracts I have been made aware of.
2209	There are a few I have open questions about or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.
2209	Can each of you please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be missing.
2209	Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response promptly I would be most appreciative.
2210	Done!
2211	I was looking this up for ClickPaper and notice Bob was working on this master.
2211	Wanted to pass on this email from Tanya...
2212	Do I owe you any other lists?
2213	So what should I do with this?
2214	Credit has them as being an "ESP", which means they are an Eligible Swap Participant under the rules of the CFTC.
2214	The CFTC sets financial criteria, such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial products .
2214	Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.
2215	Just a note: with Leslie Hansen out on maternity leave, Mark Greenberg is now the lawyer handling negotiation of the NDA's.
2216	At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching the link that will provide you access the the financial trading agreement database.
2216	Please call me if you have any questions about the information contained in the database.
2216	Link -->
2217	Do we have them open for financial (both Legal and Credit)?
2218	Do you want them to trade financial online?
2219	We do not have any ETA amendments for any Koch affiliates.
2220	Stephanie, Can you let Mark Greenberg know if Koch Petroleum Group has accepted the ETA.
2220	Thanks!
2221	Sure!
2222	Please find attached a copy of the Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement for EnronOnline.
2222	If I can be of further assistance please call me at (713) 853-3399.
2223	If we were ever thinking about becoming clearing members, now is the time to do so!
2224	Left voicemail for Bob Hillier...
2225	At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am attaching a clean and blacklined copy of the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreeement, marked to show changes from the amendment we executed with BP Exploration and Oil Inc. If this amendment meets with your approval please let me know and I will start processing it for signature.
2225	My number is (713) 853-3399.
2226	I spoke to Stephanie Sever with the online team, and Aquila Risk Management is still open as a counterparty, so no problem there.
2226	When we get the assignment in, just tell me, then we will need to open Aquila back up for financial trading (they currently have read status only) and shut down Utilicorp.
2226	for financial trading.
2227	Attached is the First Amendment to License Agreement which extends the term of the contract to March 31, 2001.
2227	My understanding is that you will be sending it directly to FT.
2227	Once they have signed off on the form, let me know and I will get Mark Greenberg to initial it and get it signed by an officer of EnronOnline.
2227	Call me at x33399 if you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance.
2228	Do you get these?
2229	At the request of Darren Vanek in Credit, we have done some preliminary due diligence regarding the ability of The Public Service Company of New Mexico to enter into financial transactions.
2229	Based on our conversations with them and review of their Board Resolution, it appears: 1.
2229	They are an investor owned utility, not a governmental entity 2.
2229	Their Board Resolution ONLY approves electricity futures, options or swaps, and gas or oil futures, options or swaps.
2229	3.
2229	THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OVER 18 MONTHS.
2229	It is imperative that anyone trading with this counterparty be made aware of this restriction Please call me if you have any questions.
2230	Nope.
2231	Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group, handes names changes/mergers.
2232	Done.
2233	I've just received your fax and am having it messengered down to an online officer for signature.
2233	I'll fax you a copy when I get it back signed.
2234	Attached is a clean and redlined draft of the NDA.
2235	We believe the password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.
2235	He will be back in the office tomorrow and Janette will try and locate it for us when he gets in.
2236	De nada...!
2237	FYI-attached is my list of notes on online approvals, which includes the South American countries we currently trade with.
2237	Justy-if you have any updates to the European countries, they would be most appreciated.
2237	I have had no updates since Edmund fell ill.
2238	For you, anything!
2239	The NYMEX will hold the following classes in Houston in June.
2239	Those of you so inclined might want to reserve a seat now, as they go fast.
2239	All the February classes are already booked.
2239	You can call the NYMEX at 713/658-9292 if you would like to attend.
2239	1.
2239	Introduction to NYMEX Products-held June 7 2.
2239	Intermediate Hedging-June 14 (Intro a prerequisite) 3.
2239	Intermediate Options-June 17 (Intro a prerequisite)
2240	Done!
2241	Per my conversation with Peter earlier today, below is a list of classes that Mark may want to coordinate his Houston secondment with so he can attend some.
2241	Internal Classes: Basics of Risk Management: 4/26 - 4/27 filling up-act quickly 5/8 - 5/9 - lots of room still here The internal classes book up quickly.
2241	Everything between now and April is already full with large waiting lists.
2241	If he is really interested he should try and sign up for classes immediately.
2241	He can do that by going to the "Development Center" Icon (aka "Ernie").
2241	Then he can sign up on the computer.
2241	External NYMEX Class: I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows: June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite) June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite) Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly.
2241	Their February classes are already full.
2241	As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques Festival is.
2241	It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston, all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that time.
2241	The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive.
2241	With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for wildflowers this year.
2241	Anyway, the above may help Mark get the most out of his time in Houston.
2242	Don't think so, but I'll check w/the NYMEX and let you know....
2243	I just spoke to Dave Fuller in the Portland Office about a potential 10 year deal he wants to do as soon as possible with the referenced entity.
2243	As we all know, because of the legal issues that arose out of the "Orange County" litigation, no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and an ISDA Master is in place.
2243	Also, besides the usual issues surround the governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions, we also need to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 10 year w/o prior voter approval.
2243	Credit, if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me I will prepare a draft ASAP and Sara will review it.
2243	Dave should be calling you with the information.
2243	Christian, if you have done any due diligence already on this counterparty we would appreciate any assistance/documents you can provide.
2243	Thank you all for your assistance with this.
2244	It is because we are required to due certain corporate due diligence prior to trading, which we don't do unless they really want to trade financial.
2244	Most of these counterparties are really interested in trading physical products, so we don't bother to do the necessary due diligence.
2244	If they really want to trade financial, we could transact w/o a master, we'd just have to check their corporate documents, file Consents to Service of Process, etc. If we're doing all that we tend to say let's just get the master in place while we're at it.
2245	I asked Tanya to confirm for me who in Credit whould be getting the emails about signed masters, and below is here response.
2246	Thanks Tanya, you're the best!
2247	Francisco, You should have gotten my email back to Justin.
2247	We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.
2247	We are responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London Legal for London based customers.
2247	A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around the world.
2247	We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.
2247	Our office is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while London leads the efforts in Europe .
2247	After we each receive advice we provide copies and communicate to each other the advice received.
2247	Even though we both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. is responsible for their own clients.
2247	As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.
2247	Since what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.
2247	If a counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time resolving those issues.
2247	As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can certainly change our policies at any time.
2247	All of the above is just what my current direction is from our lawyers.
2248	Mark Haedicke just got back today.
2248	I'm sure he's been putting out fires this morning and Janette will get back to me as soon as she has a change to chat
2249	Thanks you for your response.
2249	I will make the change in the company name and circulate the copies for signature.
2249	I hope to get them out to you in the next day or so.
2250	Looks perfect!
2251	Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.
2251	He said: Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).
2251	Shell would then immediately transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.
2251	He proposes we get a new master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher Challenge.
2251	He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since Apache is such a good credit).
2251	I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.
2251	We never enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.
2251	I'll keep you posted when I hear from him.
2252	Don't know about the Shell intermediary part.
2252	I hope that will be spelled out in his email.
2252	Also, we have about a 5 year old Local Currency ISDA in Place with them, so we could put the trades under that master.
2252	I don't know if we want to upgrade the master at this time, or just stay where we are.
2252	He said we didn't have a master w/Apache, but when entered my notes into lotus notes I noticed we did.
2252	I called him back, he didn't know ERMS was the same as ENA.
2253	On your excel spreadsheet for clickpaper, can you add the physical products to the legal tab so I don't have to copy those over each time.
2253	Thanks.
2254	This counterparty is on the 1/22/01 list.
2254	Can you open them up ASAP as follows: no physical power, for financial-U.S.
2254	financial nat gas products ONLY, all other physcial products ok.
2255	I do not need to see London's lists.
2255	Please take me off this distribution.
2256	I do not need to see London's lists.
2256	Please take me off this distribution.
2257	For Powerex, see changes on financial.
2257	For physical power, no changes to prior approval.
2257	See Legal Online Database.
2258	Dave, Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.
2258	The document you faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.
2258	That document, TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".
2258	Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.
2258	It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the counterparty.
2258	Again, the whole package above must be provided to the counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.
2258	Call me if you have any questions.
2259	We had 3 Australian counterparties on the 1/25/01 list.
2259	I need to hear from you.
2260	I'm holding up the list for 1/25/01 waiting to hear back from Australia.
2261	Well, I do believe this makes 499!
2262	Please Approve.
2263	The steel products below need to be approved, and I don't know what lawyer in your group approves steel now that Marcus is in the power group.
2264	So, per your email, I have approved them to trade all financial products, correct?
2265	Can you lend whatever assistance you, or Louise can provide, in getting me assistance from Mike Neves on adding the Contract Database for EnronOnline.

2266	The bandwidth team is ok with these products.
2266	Copy profile on the same product Credit said to copy.
2267	Please provide the following lawyers with a guest ID to the above website.
2267	The individuals listed next to the products will check any online GTC's (we think there are none), and/or short or long product descriptions to determine whether we are happy with the language/contract terms.

2268	We previously had this counterparty open to trade financial because they were ESP, and now your 1/24/01 list says they are not ESP.
2268	Which is it?
2269	Please shut down the above counterparty from trading all financial products.
2269	They are no longer an ESP.
2270	My email was more directed to the lawyers, kinda telling them what their job was once they get access.
2270	Whatever we need to do the load the systems, or whatever training, it's ok by me.
2271	Thanks!
2272	Attached is the NDA you requested.
2273	are these in the swap forms bank so we can't alter them by mistake?
2274	The Finance Group is trying to locate some really old "Master Agreements" done in 1995.
2274	We looked around and we didn't have any masters in place for the counterparties, but I was thinking maybe they really weren't "Master Agreements" but our old style confirmations.
2274	The two counterparties were State Street Bank, as Trustee for Cash I, and Citibank as Agent, for Cash I. The Agreements were listed in the closing documents as "Interest Rate Agreement" and "Commodity Swap Agreement".
2274	Can you look around and see if you have some really old active trades out there for either of those counterparties...?
2274	So not to confuse you, about 2 or so years ago, we did some deals for State Street for the Cash VI Project.
2274	The master for Cash VI is actually is listed in the Financial Trading Database.
2274	Thanks for your help!
2275	Taffy, Mary is the new lawyer in charge of the paralegals (someone needs to keep us in line, being the wild and crazy gals we are!).
2275	Can you put these re-occuring meetings on my calendar and call it "Paralegal Lunch Meeting".
2275	Thanks!
2276	Harry, Since physical steel is a new online product, I need to know from you whether you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be ablto trade physical steel.
2276	From your perspective, I would consider whetherthere is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the USfrom buying physical steel, or whether you are aware of any current litigation, payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel.
2276	Also, on a going forward basis, is there any legal impediments for any newcounterparties trading physical steel?
2277	Lisa, I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.
2277	We will not be able to copy an existing profile for physical steel.
2277	Physical steel is a totally new onlinproduct for us.
2277	We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, iftheir master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).
2277	What I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why anycounterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartieup to trade it.
2277	I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm this.
2277	Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile, because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issues specifically.
2277	I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.
2277	Just in case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...
2277	I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.
2277	Lisa Lees cc: Kelly Lombardi/NA/Enron@Enron, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Subject: Profiles for Steel Physical Products The product long descriptions below will fall under the new product types USteel Hot Rolled Physical.
2277	Credit (Tom Moran) has approved copying the profiles for the new product types from the following: US Steel Hot Rolled Fin Swap Please respond no later than 10 a.m. on Wednesday, January 31.
2277	Thank you.
2278	The Firm ID and Password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.
2278	He doesn't recall ever receiving it.
2278	I have to contact ISDA on Mark Haedicke's behalf to locate the password.
2279	Just as I suspected...
2280	I will be taking April 4, 5 & 6 off.
2280	My Mom is coming into town to visit her new grandson.
2281	We have a RUSH approval for power trading for the referenced counterparty...
2282	We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 12/28/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.
2282	Copies will be distributed.
2283	As you requested...
2284	I will be taking Friday off.
2285	Nope.
2285	Would you like me to call Mr. Fazio or would you like to?
2286	Attached is a revised NDA.
2286	Please note, Mark Taylor changed your new language a bit.
2287	Attached is an updated list of the Legal contacts for Online issues.
2287	Please provide the list to anyone you think might find it helpful.
2288	Nope, that honor goes to Susan Bailey with Aquila Canada.
2288	I guess I'll have to be happy with getting the first agreement for the next 500...the countdown continues!
2289	No, Mark Haedicke looked around and couldn't find it.
2289	So I have to call
2290	Can you provide the password to on to me, probably, also to the rest of the group.
2290	I think we need to pass the password on the England, Singapore & Australia.
2290	Also, I checked with Mark T., EES also wants to get access to the website using our password, and Mark said that was OK.
2291	Below is our password to the ISDA Netting Opinions.
2291	I'm stating the obvious, but please do not provide this to anyone outside Enron.
2292	Below is Enron's Password that will allow you access online to the ISDA Netting Opinions.
2292	In case you don't already know, you can find them on ISDA's Website at www.isda.org.
2293	Below are the directions for you to get into the TradeSpark Website.
2293	If you could please review the documents relating to your products ASAP, we would be most appreciative.
2293	Brent, for you that's weather.
2294	The guy's name is Henry Sito and his phone is 617/434-8132.
2295	That was pretty good!
2296	We're about 80 % done.
2296	I gave Mark & Tanya a rough draft to look at yesterday and am waiting back for comments.
2297	Do you want me to send it to the counterparty or do you want to?
2298	360 Networks Inc. Thanks!
2299	As you requested, attached is the form of NDA.
2300	Attached is our proposed revised draft of the article.
2300	I ask that if anyone has any additional revisions they would like that they call you with their changes.
2301	I've been booked up lately for various things (mainly people's new babies and home improvement tasks).
2301	I've been wondering where you disappeared to.
2301	Do you want to do something this weekend.
2301	There are a few new chick flicks I wouldn't mind seeing...
2302	Are we currently doing any trading out of BT, or are we doing it all under Deutsche Bank now?
2303	Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.
2303	She was about 5 lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).
2303	Her name is Sophia Eleni.
2303	Then my brother Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.
2303	He was 7 lbs, 12 oz.
2303	Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over to visit her.
2303	We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it because the baby was early.
2303	I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?
2304	De nada!
2305	It looks like they made a lot of comments to Marks form.
2306	Can you let me know what current business we might be doing with BT?
2306	Thanks!
2307	Thanks!
2308	I looked at the website and it looked great!
2308	Alena's photo of Chris is really good.
2308	She has quite the eye.
2308	And Chris's photo of the kitties looks like it could be in a kitty calendar.
2308	The photos of Daniel were really good, especially that close up.
2308	He really is a handsome baby.
2308	I am going to have to get one of those cameras so I can send Chris photos to post of the Website.
2308	Maybe we can start the Jones family monthly magazine and publish stories, articles, etc. one a month.
2308	I can be the editor.
2308	Chris can be the layout guy.
2308	What do you think of that.
2308	We could require every family member to send something in once a month!
2309	Per our conversation, can you get Bill added as a VP of Enron North America.
2309	He didn't want to fuss Enron Canada or EPMI right now.
2309	Thanks for your help!
2310	Correct.
2310	The Services Agreement in place between ENA & ECC is what allows us to transact between the two companies without adverse tax consequences.
2310	We have no such agreement in place with ECTRIC, and the UK tax regime is different.
2310	We cannot transact between ENA & ECTRIC under each others masters.
2311	Sounds good to me.
2311	Just let me know where and when!
2312	Yes, I still tract these.
2313	We have received the following executed documents from Counterparty: 1.
2313	Amendment to EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement dated 1/9/01, executed by Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. as authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities, Inc. Interstate Power Company and Wisconsin Power and Light Company 2.
2313	Consent and Acknowledgement executed 2/5/01 by each of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power Company and Wisconsin Power & Light Company acknowledging that Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. is acing as authorized agent on behalf of such utilities with respect to the ETA and Password Application 3.
2313	Password Application (EnronOnline only to have copy) A copy of this documentation will be sent to Lisa Lees and Shari Stack.
2314	I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status of your reviews.
2314	When each of you has completed the review of your products can you let me know, so we can sign off on that product.
2314	Sheri is being pressured by our traders to get this up and is also getting daily calls from the President of Tradespark.
2314	She would like to have everyone's sign off by Friday if possible.
2314	Can you let me know whether this will present any problem.
2314	Thanks!
2315	I have created a "Forms" sub-subdirectory under my "Confidentiality" subdirectory.
2315	You can now find the latest online forms there if you need one and I'm not around.
2315	The other forms in my confidentiality subdirectory are earlier drafts of the forms.
2316	When do you think you could reply by, so I can get Sheri an ETA?
2317	Hey, Queshare, how goes it?
2317	My assistant should have some plane reservations for me by the end of the day to discuss with you!
2318	Sheri, Shari is our physical power lawyer.
2318	What are your thoughts on the below?
2319	Below is Enron's password that will give you access to the ISDA Netting Opinions online.
2320	I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.
2320	There was some misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.
2320	They want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be happy to generate the master.
2320	Can I get some credit from you so I can turn around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.
2320	Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!
2321	Haskel Mayo (301) 340-4941
2322	I've got the theater w/lucinda's mom on saturday.
2322	How does fri night or sunday sound to you?
2323	ECTRIC is handled out of the UK.
2323	If you don't have a contact let me know.
2324	Sheri, Obviously, you're aware that Brent Hendry had problems when he tried to log in yesterday.
2324	Now Wayne Gresham has tried to log in and can't get in either.
2324	I expect no one else can get in, they just haven't tried yet.
2324	Can you go over your directions and figure out what's wrong.
2324	Thanks...
2325	My pleasure!
2325	cc: Subject: Re: Arbitration Language Thank you.
2326	We are not ready to execute an agreement with them until we have had some discussions with them about their authority.
2326	Please send them the ISDA then have them call Mary Cook to discuss the agreement.
2327	I just spoke to Brent and he still cannot get into the website.
2327	Can you get with TradeSpark and figure out what the problem is and how can we get our people access.
2327	Thanks.
2328	I also want to see how your house is coming along...
2329	Yes, I'm trying to get our computer guy to figure out what's the problem.
2330	Attached is revised list.
2331	At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.
2331	Please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 853-0397 if you have any questions or comments.
2332	Attached is the icon for the Financial Trading Agreement database which will allow you to look up the status of master swap agreements we are working on.
2332	If you cannot read the comments section and do not have edit capability let me know and I will get you edit access.
2333	Tanya, Can you please encourage the Credit team to use Lotus Notes to look up the status of master swap agreements.
2333	If members of your team do not have edit/comment screen access, please provide me with a list and I will get them access to the database.
2334	Can you please let me know whether the new attorneys in our group have edit access to the database, Frank Sayre, Francisco Pinto Leite and Cheryl Nelson.
2334	I think Cheryl just tried to add a note and couldn't.
2334	Thanks.
2335	Julie, Just an FYI.
2335	Depending on the type of contract, when I get them in I check them to make sure they have been correctly executed, and then, for the most part, I send the originals to Dave Samuels, who I have designated as the original file keeper for the non-trading related online documents.
2335	I keep copies of the contracts here so we have a backup copy.
2335	I am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract online we have.
2336	Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the system.
2336	He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.
2336	We cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.
2336	As soon as we have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your review at that terminal.
2336	Thanks for your patience.
2337	What is the nature of your project or discussions?
2337	Will our standard language..."information in connection with a possible transaction or other business relationship..."
2337	suffice?
2338	Please find attached NDA for distribution to your customer.
2339	I just got a call from Select Energy and they would like to get an ISDA in place with us.
2339	I told them they would have to go through Credit first.
2339	The person I spoke to was Neil Herzig, Contract Administrator, his ph is: (860) 665-3275.
2339	He said his Credit contact is Valerie Mooney at (860) 665-2387.
2340	It looks like we sent them a draft in September.
2340	I called him back and left a message that he needed to contact Susan Bailey & Ed Sacks.
2341	Per my voicemail, it appears we sent a draft of an ISDA to Susan Pharr at Select Energy in September of 2000.
2341	Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, worked on that master with Ed Sacks in our Credit Dept. Susan's phone number is (713) 853-4737 and Ed Sack's phone number is (713) 345-7712.
2341	You might want to contact Susan Pharr to get a copy of the ISDA.
2341	If you can't find it call Susan and she can get you another copy.
2342	Can you please also get Angela Davis, another new attorney in our Group, edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement database.
2342	Thanks!
2343	I would like to take another day of vacation this Friday.
2344	I checked with my boss Mark Taylor, VP and General Counsel, and he said it was OK to send you our templates forms.
2344	Per our Confirmation Desk, there are many more Physical templates for all of these commodities, but these are the basic Firm delivery templates.
2344	Nat Gas/Liquids-Financial: Nat Gas-Physical: Power Financial: Power Physical: Coal Financial: Same as Nat Gas Financial Still waiting on Coal Physical and Liquids Physical.
2345	Thanks Joe, you're the best!
2346	How does the following flight sound?
2346	Flight arriving in Calgary 5:10 pm Tuesday March 6 Flight leaving Calgary 8:05 am Sunday March 11 If those days look good for you, I'll have Taffy book the flights...
2347	Yes, I compared their blackline below against the draft I originally sent out, and the only changes were to the counterparty name, "or its affiliates" language, and NY from Texas, the same changes showing in the blackline below.
2348	I'll be there with a whole team from Enron.
2348	I look forward to seeing you there!
2349	I just wanted to let you know that I got the revised draft out by Fedex.
2349	I think it may take 2 days for Fedexes to make it up there, so I didn't want you to think it didn't go out if you don't get a copy by tomorrow.
2350	How did you decide to handle this?
2351	Below is the link that will allow you to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2351	Please forward this link to any members of your team that might find it helpful.
2352	If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the comments between Legal & Credit.
2352	We do not give this level of access to non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away our negotiating positions!).
2352	If you would like this level of access, let me know and I will put in a request.
2352	This level of access will also give you edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
2353	Attached is my proposed form of Guaranty to cover the US & UK business with Paribas.
2353	Tanya, please note, per our discussion I have increased the guaranty amount to $50mm.
2353	We have also added ECTRL to the Guaranty.
2353	Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will forward it to Paribas in NY.
2354	Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.
2354	Please let me know when they have access.
2354	Thanks!
2355	Need to hear ASAP whether you have any problems with this counterparty.
2356	Thanks Harry!
2357	Thanks!
2358	no.
2359	Thanks!
2360	Per Genia's email below, please remember that the Power Group would like to mirror any changes to our Guaranty Forms.
2360	If you make any please remember to let Genia know.
2360	Thanks!
2361	You'll see that I asked our group to keep you updated on the guaranty form.
2361	Carol St. Clair just wanted to make sure that you had our latest form of guaranty, so I am sending it to you at her request.
2362	I updated Lotus Notes.
2363	Such flattery!
2364	Stephanie Panus has a few extra copies at her Desk.
2365	Bud Ricketts called up and just wanted to get an email of the physical power agreement, I think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the computer so he could prepare a blackline draft.
2366	As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp., please be further advised: Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.
2366	All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank ISDA Master Agreement.
2366	No further financial trading should be done in the name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.
2366	All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.
2367	As a followup: This guys name is Mykhaylo Koshel and he is an outside consultant with the New Concept Group.
2367	I've got a messenger going over to Allen Center to pick up a copy of the agreement with them.
2367	I'll get a copy to you as soon as I get it.
2368	A week later?
2369	Can we find the same flight during the week below?
2370	OK
2371	Just want to make sure that you have Lisa Lees and Stephanie Sever with the EOL team on your list of "Others-Masters".
2371	Thanks!
2372	No, I just looked it up in Bankers Trust's financial statement filed with the SEC on their website, FreeEdgar.
2373	Susan, When you get in, can you provide Anthony with a copy of the Aquila master, even if the only copy we have is a faxed signature.
2373	Thanks!
2374	Taffy, Can you please take care of this.
2374	Thanks!
2375	Say it ain't so, Joe...!
2375	Where are you going?!!
2376	I called Steve Douglas to check on who should be our tax contacts, and he said he, Jeff Blumenthal and Morris Clark can certainly help us with trading related tax issues.
2376	However, he is grooming Susan Musch to become the lead trading tax person, so we might want to start calling her.
2376	Her ph no.
2376	is
2377	Do you want me to call Steve Kessler re: Enron Corp.?
2378	Yes, you do not have access to Lotus Notes, because I have been hung out to dry.
2378	They don't have time to keep up with our demands for access, so they want me to do this, and they have sent me instructions and are working on getting me the level of access to change approvals, but I'm not there yet.
2378	All things will come...
2379	It make take a bit longer.
2379	The computer people will no longer do this for us, I am going to have to do this myself, and I don't know how.
2379	I've got to figure this out.
2380	Jay, To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us: 1.
2380	PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place with us.
2380	Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading agreement.
2380	2.
2380	They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.
2380	Their suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
2380	3.
2380	They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit worksheet dated 1/25/01.
2380	We need to revisit the MACs.
2380	4.
2380	They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they suggested a threshold of $10mm.
2380	5.
2380	The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.
2380	I don't think they have quarterly.
2380	You need talk to them about what they can/will provide.
2380	If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no.
2380	is 509/252-5096.
2380	By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.
2380	If you see Bill pass this message on...
2381	It is not clear to me how we should handle this, what do you sugguest?
2381	As a note, I will be out of the office on Friday.
2382	My boss Mark Taylor was handling this with Phillip Allen.
2382	I don't know what they ever resolved.
2382	I forwarded your email on to Mark and I left a voicemail for him to please respond.
2383	Taffy, Was this taken care of?
2384	We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced counterparty.
2384	Copies will be distributed.
2385	Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct input into the EOL System).
2385	I will now only see amendments to counterparties that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.
2385	So, on amendments that affect power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.
2385	For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales only.
2385	Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid and the offer.
2385	Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales only, or open them up all the way?
2386	Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.
2386	Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather quickly.
2386	Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to proceed on this assignment.
2386	Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe give Bert a call, or what...?
2386	Please let us know.
2387	At the request of Rahil Jafry, I am attaching a copy of our proposed First Amendent to License Agreement, which extends the term from February 28, 2001 to April 30, 2001.
2387	If the Amendment meets with your approval, please execute it and return it to me via fax no.
2387	(713) 646-3490.
2387	If you have any questions or comments please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Rahil at (713) 853-3206.
2387	We look forward to hearing from you.
2388	No change yet.
2388	We are short w/space & computers, and my assistant is working with our computer floor tech to find a computer and some space so our lawyers can log into the system.
2388	Two our our lawyers are now out for the week, our gas & power lawyers.
2389	Keegan, please include me (as well as all members of the team) on any distributions when members of the Swap Group are going to be out of the office.
2389	This would include Mark Taylor, Sara Shackleton, Carol St. Clair, Mary Cook, Francisco Pinto Leite, Cheryl Nelson, Bob Bruce, Frank Sayre, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd & Stephanie Panus.
2389	Thanks.
2390	For Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc., coming thru by Credit to open them for US east power, you already had them open to trade all power under the GTC, so I am going to keep them at that.
2391	I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the Interior.
2391	I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt agency.
2391	Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.
2391	I think more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service.
2392	What is the nature of the confidential information being discussed?
2392	Will our standard language "...furnished in connection with a possible transaction or other business relationship..."
2392	suffice, or do you want to be more specific?
2392	Also, do you want the bilateral form?
2393	OK by me, have fun!
2394	Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.
2394	I discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and departments of the US government should have the correct governmental agency/department as part of the counterparty name.
2394	You could say "Minerals Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.
2394	We generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part of the name.
2394	A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service".
2394	The way the exposure rolls up under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.
2394	If you disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459.
2395	Don't we need to chat about this?
2396	Looks good to me.
2396	I'm putting it on my calendar...
2397	I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.
2397	What are you discussing with Carr?
2397	Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?
2397	Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?
2397	Who will be providing the confidential information?
2397	It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA once I get this info.
2397	I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on the email.
2397	Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is of the essence...
2398	Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline and online, until this payment dispute is resolved.
2399	Paul, Attached are the 3 NDAs you requested.
2399	Please let me know if they meet with your approval, and I will email them to your customers.
2400	I've got confirmation of the following non-refundable plane fare: leave Houston Tuesday, March 13, arrive Calgary 5:10 pm, returning Sunday March 18 at 8:05 am.
2400	Staying at the Sheraton Suite at 255 Barclay Parade SW.
2400	Is that a good hotel?
2401	If you do not have access yet to the Financial Trading Agreement Database, this link should get you access.
2401	Hopefully when you open up your computer tomorrow you will now have an icon to get in. Credit people, if you do not have edit capability let me know and I will get you access.
2401	Link -->
2402	I'll work on getting it for you!
2403	With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.
2403	Can't "ditto" Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade.
2403	The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.
2403	I don't know what "CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you?
2404	Never mind...!
2405	Sorry about the missing information!!!
2406	I just spoke to Credit about one counterparty on the list.
2406	You've got Utah Municipal Power Agency shut down to trade since they're not FERC authorized.
2406	They specifically came through online wanting to trade power, and Credit wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get whatever evidence you need to get them open for power.
2406	The name of the guy that sent the application in is Richard Judd and his ph no.
2406	is (801) 852-6842.
2406	Thanks!
2407	That was cute!
2408	Does Matt Lee, our lawyer in the Singapore office, know he needs to file NDAs with you?
2409	Link -->
2410	It sounds like he knows you should be included in the loop.
2410	I should get a copy (I hope!) so we'll see if that's true!
2411	Great!
2411	It really is a good database and I hope people use it as a resource more.
2411	It's the first thing we here in Legal look at when someone asks us a question about a master.
2412	Attached is the current list of the Confidentiality Agreements I have prepared for the Enron Net Works and EnronOnline Teams.
2412	Please review this list and let me know if you have any comments or questions with respect to this list.
2413	Attached is our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
2413	Please let me know if I didn't get the company name correct.
2413	Thanks for your help with this.
2414	When Tom is right, he's right, ditto for me!
2415	Offer still good.
2415	How goes things with the new beau?
2415	Also, thanks for the cooked meats.
2415	They were delicious!
2416	No, I havent heard anything back.
2416	Do you want to call them?
2417	As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.
2417	We have developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the counterparty.
2417	I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.
2417	For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms contained in the atty.fms bank.
2418	They are still trying to get people onto the system.
2418	What is going on with getting that terminal set up so I lawyers can review the products?
2419	Your fax of the signed NDA did not come through all the way, I only got part of the first page.
2419	Could you please refax back the whole document so I can get it signed by Enron.
2419	Thanks!
2420	Yes, I'll have Mark initial it and send it down for signature tomorrow.
2421	Tom is the man, ditto for me!
2422	Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to do with the Bankers Trust trades.
2422	In particular, they haven't thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.
2422	So, until we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades and master sit.
2423	Yes, please send this up to me.
2423	Thanks!
2424	The 1100 series.
2424	Frequently I use 1100-3, the Bilateral form.
2425	Will these instructions allow me to change the Credit people too?
2426	I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this database.
2426	Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them through the system as well?
2426	Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.
2426	One is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.
2426	Do you see that choice?
2426	Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and which employees of Credit have what access?
2426	I know that some employees of Credit have Legal access by mistake.
2426	Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit breakdowns?
2427	I took Friday, Feb 16 off.
2428	!.
2428	I'll be trying to do that big request, and will let you know if it doesn't go right.
2429	Sounds like your world is a little up in the air right now.
2429	Best wishes for success in whatever you decide to do.
2429	It has been a pleasure working with you over these years!
2430	You should have edit access now.
2430	Why don't you go try and see if it works...
2431	How do I do more than one request at a time.
2431	Can you call me a x33399?
2432	They must not let her take time off anymore.
2432	It is quite disruptive to all our business to have her our of the office, don't you think?!!
2433	Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.
2433	I have added at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because I know that one comes up frequently.
2433	Also, I don't know if you want to also suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as our LC form.
2433	The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are: Mark Taylor: Financial Trading Jeff Hodge: Physical Gas Trading Elizabeth Sager: Physical Power Trading Alan Aronowitz: Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions & Metals) Julie Murray: Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)
2434	Mark Greenberg asked me to send you the Password Application to be used for the brokers.
2434	Actually, there will not be a Password Application.
2434	What they will be signing instead is the attached Fee Agreement.
2434	Any questions, call me, Mark Taylor or Mark Greenberg...
2435	I ran it by Mark and he has no strong feeling one way or another about the comma thing, so whatever you prefer.
2436	A novation is just the European based format for doing an assignment...
2437	I tried to get you access yesterday, there are three Angela Davis's in the System, what's your email address?
2438	I just sent the request.
2438	I put a rush on it, so hopefully it should get approved today.
2439	I think my bicycle is 52 centimeters.
2439	I hope you have a tire pump, because I don't and I haven't ridden the bike in about a year and I know the tires are totally flat.
2440	I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.
2440	We have an ISDA in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.
2440	The trader is pestering me about this.
2440	What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with ENA).
2440	Is that OK with you?
2441	Is Ian a lawyer, paralegal or Credit person?
2441	Also, Mark mentioned the London Legal has been restructured somehow, and he asked me to ask you if could you fax us an org chart that shows the structure...?
2441	I hear you got a fancy new car!
2442	You are absolutely by far, no comparisons, the best!
2443	From my mouth to his ear!
2444	OK with me!
2445	I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.
2445	You might want to buy an extra tire in case you get a flat.
2445	I think I loaned Harry my old spare tire.
2445	Anytime Saturday is fine...
2446	I know I'm a pest...but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its legal entity as part of the name.
2446	This one is on the list of 2/21/01, and it is the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Department of Energy, acting through it "CRSP" area (I'm not sure what that stands for, it's the Central something something area) (ID#71175).
2446	This particular counterparty has come up before on EOL, acting through another area, the Upper Great Plains Area (ID#81177).
2446	The way I had this counterparty approved for EOL (I thought!) was: Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great Plains, a Division of the United States Department of Energy.
2446	I don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too, but it would sure make Legal happy if we did...
2447	Some financials from James Hardie have been floating around the company for about a week and they just made their way up to me.
2447	I'm going to have them forwarded down to you.
2448	Yes, I fedexed TradeSpark out to them.
2448	If you remember, I brought the file copy around to you for the file.
2449	Nope, we still don't have a terminal we can use.
2450	The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access to EnronOnline.
2450	We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and he is really hot to trade.
2450	Can you give me some estimate of when we can expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit issues?
2450	His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.
2450	Thanks!
2451	Attached is the link that will give you view access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2451	View access is available to all Enron employees, so you can pass this link on to other members of your department or your dealmakers.
2451	Link -->
2452	Mark Taylor Carol St. Clair Mary Cook Brent Hendry Sara Shackleton Frank Sayre Francisco Pinto Leite Cheryl Nelson Bob Bruce Susan Bailey Samantha Boyd Stephanie Panus Tana Jones Marie Heard
2453	Thanks, I forgot!
2454	Did either of you send this agreement to Anthony.
2455	I saw this list in the computer and you're on it.
2455	When you get back give a call and I'll come around and take a look.
2456	We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.
2456	It is located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side opposite of me, at EB3858D).
2456	Since it has taken us so long to get access into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
2456	Can you each please confirm to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.
2456	If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason, our floor computer tech, ASAP.
2456	Thanks for your prompt attention to this!
2457	Below is the link to our Financial Trading Agreements Database.
2457	This database reflects all the master swap agreements we have executed or out in draft form.
2457	I just updated The Chase Bank to reflect the amendment for your re-hypothecation of securities.
2457	Stephanie Panus, the paralegal that worked on this amendment, is having a copy walked down to you.
2457	I thought you might find this database helpful to look up the status of documents in the future.
2457	If you think other people in your group might find this database helpful, feel free to pass on the link to them.
2457	Link -->
2458	Not me!
2459	Did you want this cpy on the list for Legal/Credit meeting?
2459	ERMS hasn't been expanded as an Enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting, and we have some old ERMS era masters people are working on that aren't getting discussed, and some ERMS era masters that should be unchecked so we do not discuss them at meeting.
2460	Please remember that when adding a new counterparty whose name start with the word "The", the "The" should go out the end of the name in brackets.
2460	An example is "Times Mirror Company (The)".
2460	This will help our searching capability.
2460	Thanks.
2461	You might want to talk to your Credit team about the Top Ten List for the Legal/Credit meeting.
2461	I think we're only at 3 top ten.
2462	We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products online.
2462	Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.
2462	Justin Boyd in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of the master.
2462	Could you please provide us with credit for this master.
2462	I don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.
2462	Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe and change it for UK issues.
2462	I would suggest unless we really have problems with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.
2462	Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for the rotation.
2463	Attached for transmittal to your customer is the Prebon BETA and Fee Agreement amended to reflect the changes from the LOI.
2463	I am also attaching a blackline so you can see the changes from the first draft.
2464	You should now have edit capability in the Financial Trading Agreements Database.
2465	I got a clickpaper list today from Carol North.
2465	Is she a new member of Credit?
2466	Are we sure that the above counterparty is US and not Canadian?
2467	Is this the final form?
2468	Does Carol North work in Credit?
2469	So, I should expect to get my future clickpaper approvals from her.
2469	I just don't want to look at any lists but what Credit sends to me.
2470	Do you have a contact at the Counterparty?
2470	It is not where they are headquartered that necessarily matters, but where they are incorporated.
2471	Attached is a clean and a blacklined draft of the BETA.
2471	This draft was created using the new BETA form, and the blackline compares this draft against the form.
2471	I have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now, in case you want to show them all the changes from that draft.
2471	That blackline is called prebon.red below.
2472	We have received the executed Amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 2/22/01.
2472	Copies will be distributed.
2473	Tana Jones will be attending.
2474	At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing revised drafts of the referenced documents.
2474	1.
2474	Clean copy of BETA incorporating all changes 2.
2474	Blacklined draft of BETA reflecting changes made to the FORM of BETA since we sent you the original draft on 2/9/01 3.
2474	Blacklined draft of BETA reflecting changes made to the BETA Form to make it deal specific for Prebon 4.
2474	Clean copy of Fee Agreement incorporating changes since 2/9/01 5.
2474	Blacklined draft of Fee Agreement reflecting changes made to 2/9/01 draft
2475	Just a check, my notes in the database say we had this counterparty open for power, but when I check on profile manager, they have a read only status.
2475	Do we want them open for power or not?
2476	Sorry about that Edmund.
2476	The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called "Swap Forms" (look it up just like a person's named directory).
2476	Let me know whether you can access that database from London.
2476	We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't know if you can access other subdirectories.
2476	We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.
2476	If you can't do a comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined forms.
2476	We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.
2476	They are now located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms directory.
2476	Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up.
2477	My database is not showing that I've looked at this counterparty before, so I need to know if they are an ESP, or not?
2478	We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a CANADA corporation.
2478	Your list shows "Inc."
2478	instead of "Incorporated", and that it is a US corporation.
2478	Is this the same counterparty?
2479	Edmund Cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made as a result of the new CFTC Rules.
2479	I told him we just met on that yesterday, and as soon as we revised the form, we would send it to London.
2479	Also, if there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this, please let him and he will disseminate the information to London Legal.
2480	Do you know who in London is actually updating Legal's comments to Profile Manager?
2480	I can't believe Justin does this everyday?!
2481	I'm with you on Montana.
2481	I checked the files in the big file room, and it is a Montana corporation.
2482	Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc."
2482	to "Incorporated".
2482	Thanks.
2483	Good!
2483	I thought I just had a checkup with Bikesport shortly before I stopped riding.
2483	I was just a little afraid I might need grease.
2484	Keep me posted...have fun!
2485	This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.
2485	I checked my database and we had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.
2485	When I checked Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the bid and offer.
2485	Do you still want them to do power sales only?
2485	Both east & west?
2486	Thanks, I know I've been a pest to you today!
2487	Is there any reason why this counterparty has transact on NL power?
2487	I cannot believe they have a power marketing license there?
2488	Profile Manager also has this counterparty on transact for other European financial products.
2488	Are we really trading those products, because I don't think we should be ...?
2489	Taffy, Can you help Angela with this.
2489	Thanks.
2490	This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or "Master Swap Agreement" database.
2490	This database lists all the master swap agreements we have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South America, etc..
2490	It is a very good resource to use when preparing confirmations.
2490	This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it helpful.
2490	There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of legal-client confidentiality concerns.
2490	Any member of your legal team should be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).
2490	Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).
2490	Also, as I mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so look to confirm what type of master we entered into.
2490	If they are not ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.
2490	Please note: there is a listing for "Restrictions" which will reflect any trading limitations such as "crude oil trades only", "no trades over 2 years", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading limitations.
2490	Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain critical trading guidance.
2490	Another note to watch out for is that many US based master may have Texas law instead of NY.
2490	Certainly not UK law.
2490	We hope to have that information available in the database in the future.
2490	If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get our respective computer people to figure out why.
2490	As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to call me at x33399.
2490	Link -->
2491	Nope, not yet.
2491	I'm absolutely swamped...!!!
2491	I haven't forgotten about it tho.
2491	My short agenda is Day 1: Go over basics of financial documentation w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 2: Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 3: Spend time with you & Peter going over what I went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time approving online counterparties).
2491	Don't add a lot of people on, I get really nervous speaking in front of large groups...I am a shy girl, you know!
2491	My thoughts are
2492	Kim, this link is available to all Enron employees.
2492	If you think anyone needs it just forward it on.
2493	Yes, the agreement was dated 7/12/00 and had a two year term.
2494	Same type of discussions as those other two we sent out for auditors?
2495	It sound good to me.
2495	Shall we meet at your house or mine and at what time?
2496	Good joke.
2496	Keep me on list.
2496	If I get anthing good in I'll pass it on to you.
2496	It was good seeing you both the other week.
2496	Hugs & Kisses...
2497	Is Credit aware of this?
2498	I spoke to the woman at Sask and she's ok on everything.
2499	Sounds like a good plan!
2499	I'm at 1920 Banks Street, the last street off Shepherd before you hit the Swest Fwy.
2499	So, when you leave church, go downShepherd, then make a right on the last street before the fwy.
2499	Go past the1st stop sign and then I'll be about the 3rd or 4th house on the left, a taupe colored cottage with a pointy roof and vines growing halfway up theside of the house.
2499	My home # is 529-1038.
2499	See you at 12:45!
2499	cc: Subject: RE: Azalea Trail If you don't mind dropping me back by home after we tour, I'll have Henrydrop me at your new house after church on Sunday......maybe at 1245....I haven't seen your new digs.; Where exactly are they?
2499	Alicia
2500	For you, anything!
2501	Our project is a little different, so I think I am OK.
2501	Thanks, as usual for your help!
2502	The referenced counterparty is on the 3/1/01 list.
2502	You've got them shut down for power, but Credit's notes are specifically opening them for power.
2502	Should I open or shut down?
2503	I feel the power!!!
2504	I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.
2504	Per this conv.
2504	it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade financial and physical gas.
2504	I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to trade physical power.
2504	They are aware that Credit is working on getting them some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval from Shari).
2504	If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate it, so I'll know to look for them.
2504	I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly hold things up.
2505	Do you have copies of the Alberta and British Columbia Acts?
2505	I know they are less stringent than the US rules, but I don't know the exact levels.
2506	That signed ETA Amendment came in about a week ago, and the copy has already been sent to Lisa Lees, and the file is closed as far as I'm concerned.
2507	Below are forms you will need to prepare confirmations which we will discuss later this week.
2507	I would password protect them so no one change change them by mistake.
2508	Mercy, Since there are so many new Credit people that we (Legal) do not know, it would be very helpful if you could provide me with a new list of the Credit Team and their phone numbers.
2508	The last list we have is dated 6/5/00.
2508	Thanks!
2509	Thanks Mercy!
2510	Can you please send me only 1 list of Clickpaper counterparties per day.
2510	It gets very confusing for me sometimes to figure out what lists I should be responding to when I get multiple lists.
2511	Mark Taylor has asked me to prepare an NDA for the referenced counterparty.
2511	Please let me know if we have any existing NDA's in place.
2511	Thanks.
2512	At the request of Kay, I have started sending my requests re: Confidentiality Agreements to her via email so she can print out a record for her files.
2513	Click on the following link to add the 'Financial Trading Agreements' database to your Notes Workspace: Link -->
2514	I believe this is yours...
2515	Mary, All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.
2515	London can get into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the o: drive is the atty.fms bank.
2515	If we put the swap forms back there, they can get at them.
2515	I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London.
2516	Hey Mark, I think these are yours!
2517	The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.
2517	It is an Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other Agreements".
2517	Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the entry in the master swap agreement database.
2517	Thanks!
2518	Attached please find the referenced lists.
2518	On the list of 3/12/01a, I have not yet seen the list from Gobal Contracts with the corrected names, but I cannot believe Lyke Corporation (also called Ripon Community Printers) is a valid legal name.
2518	We might want to get that sorted out before we start trading with them.
2519	Attached is the proposed form of LOI.
2519	Please let me know if it meets with your approval, and I will email it to the customer.
2519	I kept the language in the term sheet in the back pretty broad as it references "energy commodities".
2519	Your language re "US crude and products" wasn't clear to me.
2519	Perhaps you meant US crude and crude derivative/refined products?
2519	Will energy commodities work, or do want to limit it to crude products and charge more for other products?
2520	It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only.
2520	Having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.
2520	That is why we created the "Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.
2520	My understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.
2520	The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been proliferating.
2520	If my understanding is not correct, than when did the intentional use of that first section change?
2520	I think putting all agreement is a very bad idea.
2521	I revised the language in the "Description of Transaction" section and where the fee is and just wanted to make sure you were Ok before I sent it to your customer.
2521	I've already drafted my email, I just need your OK.
2522	You need to talk to Stephanie Sever at x33465.
2523	Attached is my proposed form of NDA.
2523	I set up the choice in products similar to they way we did it in Prebon.
2523	Take a look and let me know if it meets with your approval.
2524	Mike, I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other agreements access to that information.
2524	Our brokers are quite confidential.
2524	The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the master swap agreements.
2524	Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me.
2524	It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.
2525	Greg and I tried to call you but you weren't there.
2525	We'll call you tomorrow.
2526	Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.
2526	I am in Calgary this week.
2526	Stephanie and I met with Mark Taylor about this on Monday, and he said to go ahead and confirm this under the Houston master with Hess Energy Trading Company LLC.
2527	That was pretty good!
2528	He can call any one of the attorneys in the Swap Group, Mary Cook does Canada, but she'll be out next week so it would have to be quick, or Sara Shackleton or Brent Hendry.
2529	Jennifer, If you're still there give me a call in calgary about this, I'm at
2530	At the request of Liz Sager, I am attaching our language with respect our transfer:
2531	Do you want a bilateral or one-way, and what is the nature of your discussions?
2532	The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.
2532	We had a counterparty on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was ID#1836.
2532	Was that one in error?
2532	Are they the same, different?
2532	What's the scoop?
2532	Thanks for your help!
2533	Sam, I think counterparty ID# 754 is Bonneville Power Administration, not Bonneville Power Association.
2534	Taking a look at BPA from the 3/8/01 list, I noticed that we've got them opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid.
2534	I have no notes that they are restricted in that manner.
2534	What's the scoop?
2534	Marcus, do you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side?
2535	Oops, I forgot to add your name, even tho I meant to...
2536	Can you look around for the fax of this NDA signed by the Counterparty.
2536	Mark Greenberg will need to initial it and then send it down to Daniel Diamond and he will get an EnronOnline and Enron Net Works officer to sign it.
2536	Once it is signed we will need to fax it to the counterparty.
2536	I will forward Dan's email with the fax and phone number of the counterparty to you.
2536	Thanks!
2537	Yeah, see if Mark T. will initial it.
2537	Tell him it's for a broker relationship and there we no changes to the form.
2538	Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
2539	Justin, What's your deadline for getting these approved?
2539	Mark Taylor is out all weekend, and if it can't wait I'll get another lawyer to look at it.
2540	Just a note in case some of the product abbreviations on the NYMEX calendar don't make sense, they have what the abbreviations mean at the back of the calendar.
2541	I just did a request to get Angela Davis in the Houston Office and Linda Sietzema and Sharon Crawford in the Calgary offices edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2541	I also requested that Marcus Nettelton get edit access to the ENA Legal Online Trading Database.
2541	I'm not sure if I did the "erequest" all ok.
2541	Can you check to make sure your got all four?
2541	Thanks!
2542	If you have time to attend, please join us...
2543	Mike, I attempted to give Edmund Manager access by doing one of those security requests today.
2543	I don't know if you need to do anything or not here....
2544	I'll come pick you up.
2545	Is there an Icon I can send to Marcus to get into the ENA Legal Online Database.
2546	Can someone call me at x33399.
2546	I'm in the middle of doing these again and it won't let me submit the form.
2547	Good memo Peter.
2547	Is it OK if I forward this to the Credit Team so they also know how this process will work?
2548	In order to complete your access request, I need your company number and your 6 digit sap cost center code.
2549	Are these physical transactions?
2550	OK by me!
2551	The swap forms have been moved back into the atty.fms bank, so you should be able to access them again.
2552	At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching the revised BETA and Fee Agreement for your review.
2552	Bob will call you tomorrow to discuss them.
2553	Your access to the Financial Trading Agreement has been completed.
2553	Why don't you take a look and make sure you now have edit capability.
2554	You now should have access to the datasbase, give it a try and see if it works!
2555	Link -->
2556	I don't know what this is about.
2556	Is this for the home computers we are supposed to get?
2556	If it is I actually haven't done anything about it (that I am aware of).
2556	If it is for the home computer thing, I probably will want to upgrade.
2556	Let me know...
2557	Do we have an outside counsel memorandum, or will we have an internal one soon, that we can send to Martin (as well as the other non-US swap lawyers)?
2558	Your access to the financial trading agreement database is approved.
2558	The icon is attached below.
2558	Why don't you take a look and see if you've got edit capability to the database.
2558	Link -->
2559	We have received executed copies of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement dated 3/19/01 and the Fee Agreement dated 3/19/01 with respect to the referenced Counterparty.
2559	Copies will be sent to Lisa Lees.
2560	I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the referenced counterparty.
2560	His phone number is 713/752-4514.
2560	He said that VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain revisions.
2560	He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.
2560	I looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved them to trade physical power with an override letter.
2560	Usually, we don't allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override letters, I know there is some wiggle room.
2560	I don't know how you want to handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.
2560	Just let me know.
2561	I am going to run w/holly at 7:00 on saturday and then meet her for breakfast at 8 at the IHOP.
2561	Lucinda is going to join us for breakfast.
2561	I thought maybe if it met w/your running schedule you might want to join us...
2562	Holly & I are going running Saturday at 7, then meeting Lucinda for breakfast at the IHOP at 8.
2562	Do you want to join us?
2563	Done.
2564	I got your company number on my own, so now we just have to wait to have the erequest approved.
2564	I hope it will be today.
2565	Mark Taylor, the lawyer who would review all new product descriptions for financial products is on vacation and will not be back until Tuesday.
2565	I hope this can wait until then...
2566	I live to Swap!
2567	I hope Carol will come!
2567	Holly was going to call her.
2568	I wanted to let you know that the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty has been agreed to with BNP Paribas and has been sent up to Enron Corp. for signature today.
2568	I will send you a copy of the Guaranty once it is fully executed.
2569	I hope we can do more than meet, if possible, let me buy you dinner!
2570	At the request of Kay Young, I am faxing you the four confirmations for the referenced deal.
2570	Please look for them.
2571	I've gotten some calls from the business people who want to trade with two counterparties right away.
2571	One is Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, which is on the list for the 19th, and the other is Mobil Oil Corporation Supply & Distribution which is on the list of the 20th.
2571	Can you please make sure the individuals in Global Contracts responsible for these counterparties update them today.
2571	Our business people would be most appreciative!
2572	Thanks for the assist!
2573	As an introduction: The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not all of the products it wants to trade).
2573	When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the European products, including specifically European physical power products (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).
2573	Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).
2573	What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, which I never open them for.
2573	Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it.
2573	So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian based products (especially physical power).
2573	If you didn't, then I am going to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down for European physical power.
2574	It's only a reflection of our high regard for you that we pass on this matter for your adept handling.
2575	You're a machine!
2576	Sam & Stephanie, Re: Cargill Ferrous International It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.
2576	Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."
2576	or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".
2577	Re: Glencore Commodities Limited (cpy 92858) The counterparty is my work queue is Glencore Ltd., (cpy26313) not the above.
2577	Is this a mistake?
2578	Do you know the progress of getting a physical power master in place with this counterparty?
2578	Can you keep me apprised.
2578	They are obviously a quasi-affiliate and we have internal people contacting me checking on their progress.
2578	Thanks!
2579	Why do you say OK for weather?
2579	What restrictions do you have for counterparties trading weather?
2580	Attached is my list that I use as a reference.
2580	Please let me know if you disagree with any of the European advice.
2581	You, as counsel, can agree to any form of NDA you think is acceptable.
2581	I will print it out and bring it around for signature
2582	Your Manager access appears to be completed.
2583	Sharon, Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for this counterparty in January of this year.
2583	I would just confirm that the credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.
2583	I am going to fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can check the credit.
2583	Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared.
2584	Sharon, There are some hanky things going on in these confirms I don't like.
2584	I've just spoken to Russell and I'm going to talk to a swap attorney and then get back to you.
2585	I spoke to Stephanie and anytime between 9-11 am or after 3:30 pm would be fine for us.
2585	Just let us know.
2586	I don't know if Mark Greenberg ran this one by you or not, we are already preparing it for signature, but can you check on this counterparty for NDAs.
2586	Much thanks!
2587	I don't know what you're talking about, so I must not be the right person.
2588	We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.
2588	Our notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on 3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed.
2588	My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha, but they have not yet shown up here.
2588	If you sent them fedex and can track them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.
2588	They appear to have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has now become a really high priority.
2588	Thanks!
2589	Things are looking better.
2589	We tracked down the documents and it appears that Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.
2589	I just spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.
2589	Once we get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the ISDA.
2589	I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in.
2590	Brant, please do not put me on emails for day to day business, drafts of masters and confirms.
2590	Thanks.
2591	At the request of Julie Ferrara, I am attaching our proposed Second Amendment to License Agreement which extends the term of the License Agreement from March 31, 2001 to June 30, 2001 .
2591	If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the Second Amendment and return it to me via fax no.
2591	(713) 646-3490.
2591	I will then have it executed by Enron.
2591	If you have any comments or questions please call me at (713) 853-3399.
2592	TFS was sent out but has not came back in signed.
2592	I was out yesterday, so Spectron has not gone out.
2592	I have that on my list to do today.
2593	What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?
2593	I think this is really confusing for our Canadian team.
2593	There must be requirements for the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.
2593	I just don't think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure out.
2593	What do you think?
2594	Linda & Sharon, My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline is quite a beast of a customer.
2594	Because of that I please ask that you direct any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and Stephanie Panus at x53249.
2594	With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.
2595	We have received the originally signed copy (via fax) of the Termination Agreement dated 3/15/01 with respect to EnronOnlineTransactions Nos. 10000172 and 1000173.
2595	Copies will be distributed.
2596	I am OK with what Credit say, which is if the counterparties are already approved for trading those pulp & lumber products theyan trade the new products, except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful about becuase they could only tansact newsprint: The Bakersfield Californian: can transact only newsprint E.W. Scripps Company (The) can only transact 48.8 gram newsprint swaps
2597	OK for me.
2598	I can't tell by Lotus Notes, is anyone aware of a "credit sleeve" with TMG?
2599	I take it all the other counterparties on this list cannot transact power since they are restricted by Credit...
2600	We haven't heard anything on this NDA, have you?
2601	Are these additional counterparties?
2601	I only look at lists I receive from Credit.
2602	Let me know if I am missing any lists...
2603	I'm not showing I looked at this list at all.
2603	Isn't that right?
2604	Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?
2605	Reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp & paper deals that came into the fax area.
2605	Is anyone looking for this stack of confirms?
2605	If not, I'll have Reggie walk them down to Joe Hunter.
2606	I tracked down the culprit who worked on this master and it was Mark Taylor.
2606	I know he called Jon McKay and had a conversation with him about it and is looking at the master for particular issues in response to his conversation with Jon.
2607	Another Division Mark, Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a division.
2607	My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.
2607	Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.
2607	Do you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as divisions?
2607	Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss divisions?
2607	What to do?
2608	Per conv.
2608	a minute ago with Marcus, Christi Nicolay in the Regulatory Group just checked and Ontario Power Generation does not have a FERC marketing license.
2608	That leaves them to buying US power only (both east & west OK).
2608	Please make this change immediately.
2608	Thanks!
2609	I want a parking space in the new garage.
2609	Please let me know what I need to do to get it!
2610	Well, I guess we could.
2610	since we needed to do it immediately, only Stepanie can only do it immediately.
2610	Do you want me to change it, or, Stephanie, since you've already changed it will it be already changed tomorrow so we don't need to do anything.
2610	I'm so confused?!!!
2611	I'm working on Samantha's IMC Canada.
2611	It was signed by faxed signatures yesterday and I am expecting the originally signed documents to come in by Federal Express today.
2612	Will, I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.
2612	I also need to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a one way form that protects Enron only.
2612	In circumstances where we are certain Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to use that form.
2612	Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential information you are discussing so we can protect the information being discussed.
2613	No.
2614	I was out Monday with a migraine.
2615	I've got the awards dinner wrong.
2615	That should be yes.
2615	RSVP - Law Conference Autoreply Please respond to Sara.Davidson
2616	Thanks!
2617	OK for me.
2617	Lisa Lees cc: Tom Moran/Enron@EnronXGate, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Product Type Aprroval - US Plastic RGC3 Phy Fwd) The product long description below will fall under the new product type USPlastic RGC3 Physical Forward.
2617	Credit (Tom Moran) has approved copying theprofiles for the new product type from the following: US Styrene FOB Physical Forward Please respond by Monday, April 2.
2617	Thank you.
2618	I think this one is your to approve (or someone in power).
2619	I think it may be possible that we have existing NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty.
2619	The nature of our discussions that I am currently preparing an NDA for is the possible access to and use of a web-based transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade (including derivative products).
2620	You're wearing me down, you're relentless!!!
2621	How about this one?
2622	Thanks.
2622	I seem to be keeping you busy today!
2623	It makes me feel so wanted...not!
2624	I have complete faith in you!
2624	By the way, the guy from Star already called with corrections to their company name, it's Starsupply Petroleum Inc. He said he passed the agreement on to his legal and he would be getting us comments back on Monday.
2625	Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.
2625	Even though we have chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, and it might be missing some required US language.
2625	I have also attached a redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form we first sent the form to the counterparty.
2625	I have attached our current form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.
2625	The Canadian changes will be color coded, so you can see them easily.
2625	Also, please note: there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no longer "eligible swap participants", the current terminology is "eligible contract participant".
2625	Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular.
2626	I'm not showing I got your response for this day...
2627	Those are negotiated changes.
2627	The only was to tell what is a "Canadian" thing is by looking at the form.
2627	It is color coded with different colors for different countries or other special legal issues.
2627	I believe Canada is a purplely pink color in the form, the footnotes should tell you.
2628	My notes show that this is a governmental.
2628	It is the utility for the Town of Colorado Springs, Colorado.
2629	I do not have an EZ tag.
2630	I never heard back from you.
2630	You were going to look at my list of approved jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.
2630	I'll be out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas countries and how I should respond about European countries.
2631	Strictly informational.
2631	I need to know everytime we have a governmental entity, so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a governmental I had to research that.
2631	I was sharing the information I gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know this.
2631	Obviously, you did.
2632	Re: Usinor SA: that appears to be a London counterparty.
2632	It should not be on our list.
2632	London Legal should approve their counterparties for ALL products, not only European based.
2633	I do not have an EZ tag.
2634	While I am out this week can you please send the online lists to Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our Group.
2634	She will forward them to the distribution so we don't lose any time.
2635	I will be out from this afternoon through the rest of this week.
2635	In my absence Stephanie Panus will be sending you the EOL Lists.
2635	Please direct any responses you have to the lists to ME, not to Stephanie.
2635	Thank you.
2636	With respect to that rush Guaranty for the referenced counterparty you so kindly got me on Monday, per our conversation, we will need an incumbency certificate for that guaranty as well.
2636	As usual, I appreciate your help!
2637	Just a reminder to check on whether we have an NDA in place or not...
2638	At the request of Stephen Abbanat, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
2638	We would appreciate it if you could please verify whether "CMS Energy-Panhandle Pipe Line Companies" is the correct legal name of your company.
2638	If you have any comments or questions, please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897as I will be on vacation the rest of this week.
2639	OK for me.
2640	1.
2640	If we have a US counterparty we insert the appropriate choice.
2640	2.
2640	Revisions to the CFTC Rules have done away with the "Eligible Swap Participant" rules for energy commodities (they would still apply to agricultural products).
2640	The rules are still pretty similar however, and thcurrent lingo is now "Eligible Contract Participants".
2640	See our revised forattached.
2640	cc: Marianne Castano/HOU/EES@EES Subject: swaps I have a couple of questions concerning swaps that I hope you can answer.
2640	1.
2640	With respect to Part 2.
2640	Tax Representations.
2640	to the Schedule, is it standard to insert into the Schedule the information from Form #3 when dealing with a U.S. Counterparty?
2640	2.
2640	Part 5.
2640	Other Provisions.
2640	Is the following point the most current andalso a standard provision in the Schedule when dealing with a U.S. Counterparty?
2640	(h) Eligible Swap Participant.
2640	It constitutes an &eligible swap particias such term is defined in Rule 35.1(b)(2) of the Commodity Futures TradingThanks alot for your continued support of EES Legal.
2640	Thanks Karen
2641	Thanks for your help this week, I appreciate it!!!
2642	Anytime!
2642	cc: Subject: Re: swaps Thank you Tana.
2643	Attached are the online contracts.
2644	No!
2645	Per notice below, please note that E.D.F Man International Inc.has changedits name to Man Financial Inc. (you may already know this, but I didn't!)
2646	Yes.
2647	It looks like Mark has been working on this from out of the office.
2647	Maybe you don't have to do anything!
2648	The ISDA Agreement is not in electronic form.
2648	I will send you over a clean version.
2649	That's a deal!
2650	I got a call from National Bank of Canada and they said that we purchased the referenced company and what did we intend to do with the trade between NBC and Daishowa?
2650	Anyone know anything about this?
2651	To confirm our conversation yesterday, the referenced counterparty can only purchase power in the east.
2652	Ken Curry is following up with the woman from NBC on this.
2653	You are the Best!
2654	Mark, We emailed an Enron One Way NDA to Global Crossing, Ltd. 11/22/00 at the request of Peter Feltman.
2654	Was there something the matter with that form or is this for something totally different?
2655	I was on Vacation as follows: Tuesday April 2, after 2:00 pm Wed, April 3 Thurs, April 4 Friday, April 5
2656	Do we had any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty.
2656	In particular, they seem to be interested in the liquids trading/group.
2656	Thanks!
2657	See my initial email to Sam Schott and Stephanie, about 3rd email from the bottom, there's two samples of how we could set divisions (the same could be said for dba's).
2658	To summarize and in response to our meeting last week: 1.
2658	I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.
2658	Please let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes you would like.
2658	This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team Wednesday afternoon.
2658	Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people you would like the list circulated to.
2658	2.
2658	All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed to me instead of Kay Young.
2658	The request for the NDA should be sent to me by email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company and the company's address.
2658	In addition, each request for an NDA for EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).
2658	At the request of the dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so an email address should be included.
2658	If you would like the NDA sent some other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).
2658	3.
2658	I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.
2658	I will then circulate the NDAs for signature.
2658	When fully executed, the originals will be filed with Kay Young.
2658	Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).
2658	4.
2658	Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she has prepared that should be added to the list.
2658	If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please call me at x33399.
2659	I wanted to thank you and your team for getting this done so quickly.
2659	I really appreciate it!
2660	Swap away!
2661	I'm sorry about not turning this around sooner.
2661	I thought I might be getting other comments from you.
2661	If it meets with your approval, please sign it and return it via fax no.
2661	(713) 646-3490 and I will have it signed by Enron and return a copy to you by fax.
2662	We need to act on Marcus's email immediately.
2662	Ed, if you disagree, you need to talk to Marcus.
2663	The referenced counterparty is on the list below for online approval to trade us gas financial products.
2663	This counterparty came through before on the 1/20/00 list and we did not approve them for financial trading because of a "payment dispute".
2663	Is anyone out there aware of the payment dispute with this counterparty, and has it been resolved?
2663	Can we open this counterparty up to trade financial?
2663	They are an ESP...
2664	As as follow-up to my earlier email, it is now OK to immediately open the referenced counterparty back up to transact both sides of USphysical power as we have received the necessary documentation evidencing their authority to trade power.
2665	Bill, I think you are about to become my new best friend!
2665	We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.
2665	The Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled: Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
2665	(Which also happens to be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this Counterparty.) They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already set up: (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
2665	The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.
2665	Can you help us?!!!
2666	Can you help me with this?
2667	Any conflicts
2668	What is the nature of your discussions?
2669	Do you have an address for them?
2670	That Tom is a smart man, I'm just going to have to mirror him!
2671	Should this basket of weather swaps be treated special in any way?
2672	Clem, Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.
2672	Carolyn started working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).
2672	Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB relationship for the law firm.
2672	Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be around.
2672	I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc. I think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.
2673	At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am forwarding to you the proposed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Pricewaterhouse (for CreditDimensions) and Enron Credit Limited.
2673	Mark Greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made a few changes to Pricewaterhouse's form.
2673	If you have any questions about the transaction, the business person on the deal is Kim Detiveaux here in Houston.
2673	Otherwise, we would appreciate your assistance in getting Richard Sage in London to execute this agreement.
2674	For Compaq, you say approved for financial trading, but then you've got an "X" in the box.
2674	I think you need to open them up...
2675	Ditto Credit.
2676	Please talk to Mark Greenberg, an attorney in our group, at (713) 345-8897.
2676	I am a paralegal.
2677	Sorry about that!
2677	With respect to the amendment to the list for 4/18/01, the approval I sent down earlier should still be good since I'm the one that figure out she said approve for financial and then had them shut down for financial.
2678	We've got an Australian counterparty on the list for the 18th.
2679	Legal is OK to open the above counterparty immediately for US east physical and financial power products.
2680	Please let me know if you have any comments to the attached list.
2681	you've got to get this straight with Global Counterparty or you're going to have a bust on your trades.
2682	I have revised the list to add a few more NDAs that have come to my attention, and then am also sending the regular Net Works NDA List as well.
2682	I hope these are helpful.
2683	You are the best!
2684	We're on!
2684	7:00 pm.
2685	Would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to?
2685	I would like to get this Koch thing resolved ASAP, so I think the sooner, the better.
2685	From Legal's side, both Mary Cook and I need to be included, I spoke to Credit and both Walter Guidroz and Tom Moran would like to be included, probably Joe Hunter from the Confirm Desk as well, and anyone else you're aware of.
2685	Let me know how you think we should proceed.
2686	With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to follow): Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty name in GCP.
2686	The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 characters.
2686	I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.
2686	LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent for three listed utilities Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?
2686	If you can let me and Sam know then Sam can get them set us.
2686	Thanks for your help!
2687	I'm just going to have to call you Quick Draw McGraw!
2687	I Can't print the lists out before I get a response from you!
2688	At Wendi's request, I have submitted a request to get you both edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2688	In the meantime, below is the icon that will allow you to have view access to everything but the comments.
2688	I will let you know when your edit access is approved (at which time you will be able to input changes/comments, as well as be able to see comments).
2688	link -->
2689	Things have come up w/Mark & Sara and there is a clear indication from their front that we need to retain the green files.
2689	Maybe we need to discuss this with the whole group...?
2690	You should have edit access now.
2690	Why don't you go and take a look.
2691	You should have edit access now.
2691	Why don't you go in and take a look.
2692	Just a note so we are all on the same page...
2692	I just had a superseded and replaced Enron Corp. guaranty that the counterparty returned to me, and I asked Clem to verify what he wanted me to do with the old original guaranty, and he said to send it back to him and he would have Cindy mark it "canceled".
2693	I havent heard anything back from them, Mark, have you?
2694	Upon consultation with various members of the Swap Group, I am having Taffy make dinner reservations for 7:00 pm at La Fogata in San Antonio for 14 people on Wednesday night.
2694	This is not obligatory, so if you have other dinner plans, please do not feel under any pressure to join us, just let me know.
2694	Of course, if any one comes up with a better place, I'm open to suggestions..., but at least we'll have something!
2695	Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, Doug Friedman was involved in the payment dispute that was the reason I didn't open them up for financial trading the first time they came around in January 2000.
2695	Based on the email below, I will be opening them up on EOL to trade financial.
2696	thanks Taffy!
2697	I was just thinking, if you could get to my office a little earlier, say 5:00 on Monday, I could take you on my "nickle" tour of Houston while it is still light outside, if you like?!
2698	I've got you down for Monday, can you do Monday?
2699	Are you ok with this (they would not be listing, as agent for 3 listed utilities)?
2700	I am sorry I am just getting back to you, but I had to check with my wholelegal team around the world, and I just heard back from the final criticalone.
2700	We are OK with them trading the products below.
2700	However, on physicalpower, they can only trade west power.
2700	Stephanie, will you need to open them up so they can trade immediately?
2700	To: Lisa Lees/ENRON@enronXgate, Stephanie Sever/ENRON@enronXgate, Ta cc: Subject: FW: PG&E Energy Trading Entities Lisa/Stephanie, could you please ensure that the trading profiles for each of the three PG&E entities are changed below such that by tomorrow morning thewill be able to transact once we restore their headroom once we enter it into the system?
2700	Tana, are you OK with restoring the changes reflected below?
2700	I'm thinkingthat since they had this transact ability once before, that it should be OKPLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANY PROBLEMS.
2700	Thanks all!
2700	Walter
2701	Link -->
2702	You are the best!
2702	cc: Subject: RE: FW: PG&E Energy Trading Entities Their profile has been modified.
2702	Thanks, Stephanie
2703	When you send out your email list of counterparties can you please identify the following counterparties whenthey are on the list as the present particular legal problems: 1.
2703	governmental entities 2.
2703	hedge funds Much thanks!
2704	Ok for me.
2705	OK for me.
2706	Rob, can I get the four deal nos.
2706	so I can get the information I need from the confirm desk to prepare the termination letters?
2706	I will contact Steve South to get the name & phone nos.
2706	of the contacts at the counterparty I can send the letters to.
2707	Attached is a list of four deals for some online "oops" trades.
2707	Can you send me the deal particulars so I can prepare terminations of the trades.
2708	Rob Cass sent me the deal nos., and I have made a request to the confirm desk to get the trade terms.
2708	Thanks for your help.
2709	I really don't know.
2709	Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the database, won't work because of outlook.
2709	I haven't had this problem with any other people on outlook before.
2709	You might want to talk to your computer person.
2709	He can probably find the database the long way.
2709	It is just a misc.
2709	Lotus Notes application.
2710	Whatever happened to the NDA we sent over to London for signature for Enron
2711	You are bad to the bones...!
2712	Yes, I never got the signed NDA faxed to me.
2713	Yes.
2714	I never heard back whether you were OK with the "for 3 listed utilities" being dropped off the "as agent" thing...
2715	Should we reject this from this onset or do you think it is OK?
2716	marcus is ok with the name change without the "for 3 listed utilities", so let it fly!
2717	Thank you Kay, I really appreciate all your help!
2718	As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".
2718	Project Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a residuals clause.
2718	I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.
2718	The form, like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements" subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around).
2719	Do we have any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty?
2720	Attached for your review is a list of the NDAs we either have executed or have sent drafts to the customer.
2720	Please take time to review this list to make sure that the status of any NDA you are interested in is correctly reflected.
2720	Call me at x33399 with any comments or questions.
2721	Do you have the address for the counterparty?
2722	Attached is the NDA you requested.
2723	Sounds like an Indian chief!
2723	Of course, the name on this LOI I just got is Finn Swarting, which isn't much better!
2724	Quick Draw...!!!
2725	Can I send my old parking card back thru interoffice mail?
2726	I'll be there.
2726	I didn't sign up for the organized activities.
2726	I'll just be hanging out.
2726	The Swap Group is having dinner Wednesday night, if you haven't already made plans do you want to join us, we're about 15 in number right now!
2727	It's a date!
2728	We've picked up two more diners for La Fogata in San Antonio, Andrea Calo and Yao Apasu.
2728	Can you call back the restaurant and switch our reservation to two tables of 8 people, instead of one table of 14.
2728	I think a table of 8 will be more manageable than a table of 16.
2728	Thanks!
2729	As we discussed, attached is my "Cheat Sheet" which I use to guide me when approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston Credit.
2729	London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties to trade online.
2729	They also frequently deal with different countries than us.
2729	You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.
2729	Generally, with respect to most physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to trading.
2729	Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial products.
2729	Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US and UK counterparties.
2729	With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.
2729	As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me.
2730	Yes, Mark Greenberg will pick this up.
2731	Link --> The link is above.
2731	I have to do your request for edit capability.
2731	You will not be able to see comments or make Credit comments until your request is completed.
2731	I will let you know when that is done.
2732	She seemed to have more initiative than the average temp.
2732	Was nice.
2732	I would be fine with having her work for me again.
2733	Re: Element Re I just checked with Brent Hendry, the attorney on this one, and it should read "...as agent for XL Trading Partners Ltd."
2733	not "of"
2734	The Swap Group has already made plans for a dinner on Wednesday or I would love to join you.
2734	Thanks for inviting me!
2735	Thanks, you're the best!
2736	Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.
2736	The trades should continue to be initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.
2736	These same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.
2736	Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.
2736	The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.
2736	The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated.
2736	Reverse trades should not be entered into.
2736	If you have any questions, please call.
2737	Any problems with this counterparty?
2738	Any Problems with this counterparty?
2739	Danm that doesn't sound like a full legal name...?
2740	thanks for your help!
2741	below are the four "oops" trades the prompted my changing of the procedure.
2741	I left a voicemail for the trader to provide me with the phone number and name of the person who he spoke to but he never returned my calls.
2741	I guess, if someone from Joe's group could please prepare the two termination letters and get them signed...
2741	Thanks.
2742	Link -->
2743	Your attachment doesn't seem to be attached...
2744	Yes, are you at the top of the list?
2744	You should be trying to open the top database that says "secured".
2745	I have forwarded your email to Mary Cook, a lawyer in our "Swap Group", for handling.
2745	Her direct dial number is (713) 345-7732.
2746	Just a note to always remember to check "ERMS", we are frequently amending or updating and replacing old ERMS masters with ISDAs and ERMS should always be added as a company when you prepare the legal credit list.
2746	Thanks.
2747	It won't let me open the document.
2747	Can you ressend it?
2748	Ok to copy.
2749	We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.
2749	Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs together.
2749	Dress is casual.
2749	The phone number for the restaurant is 210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar (this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).
2749	If you haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count for tomorrow.
2749	See you in San Antonio.
2750	Yao, you're a bum, we will miss you at dinner tonight!
2751	Any conflicts?
2752	As you requested, attached is the referenced NDA.
2753	Any conflicts?
2754	Attached is the NDA for the referenced counterparty.
2755	Mary Cook also asked me to forward the below email re: NYMEX collateral toyou.
2756	I would love to pick up you and Henry!
2757	Any conflicts?
2758	Sheri, I need to know the nature of the discussions we will be having with this company so I know how to word the decription in the agreement.
2758	Also, usually I email the agreements directly to the counterparty, so unless he will be delivering this in another manner, I will need an email address.
2759	We do not have a master swap agreement in place with CMS Field Services, Inc. so there is no need to send us a copy of the notice.
2760	Marilyn, Do we have some documentation from the City that shows the City of Long Beach with a "Inc."
2760	at the end of their name?
2760	I have never seen a city with an Inc. at the end of their name before, that is a corporate thing, not a municipal thing...
2761	OK for me.
2762	Pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered into the power EEI, and at the direction of Marcus Nettelton, a lawyer in the power group, the counterparty name for the Port of Oakland should set up in GCP as follows: The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Board of Port Commissioners GCP, if you could please redo the counterparty name, and Stephanie, if you could please resubmit the PA to match the counterparty name, then we can get this one done...
2763	Thanks for the info.
2763	I'll direct it to her the next time.
2764	We have another problem with that 90 character thing...
2765	At the request of Travis McCullough, I am attaching a copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, revised to delete the non-solicitation clause.
2766	Joe, I need the deal specifics so I can prepare an exhibit.
2767	Per my voicemail, attached is the assignment of the FPL trade.
2767	If you could please attach as Exhibit A, the specifics of the trade and then fax the assignment to the counterparty.
2767	When the counterparty faxes the signed Assignment back we will have to have it initialled by a lawyer since it is a contract, and send it up to me and I will get someone to sign it.
2768	Enron Net Works LLC needs another NDA in place with the referenced company.
2768	Any conflicts?
2769	I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.
2769	Some of us (I won't name names!) are hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!
2769	Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and attached below are the recipes for the evening.
2769	I will provide beer, wine and soft drinks.
2769	In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.
2769	Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to prepare.
2769	Laura Johnson (1) Charles and Janice Thompson (2) Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2) Beryl and Ray Mack (2) The directions to my house are as follows: 1.
2769	Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church) 2.
2769	Make a right on Greenbriar 3.
2769	Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first left possible onto a street called Milford 4.
2769	Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the opposite direction) 5.
2769	The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 59 freeway) 6.
2769	On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks 7.
2769	My phone number is (713) 529-1038
2770	Matt, The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).
2770	Attached is the icon, which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in the database except the legal and credit comments.
2770	I will make a request to add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.
2770	I think Denis O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he has edit access.
2770	(you can just copy this link and add it to emails to people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).
2770	Link -->
2771	Matt, Justin Boyd, Mark Elliott and Paul Simons already had edit access to the database.
2771	From London, Nicola Beales, Robert Quick, Tracy Foy & Robert McGrory (is he in Legal?) already have edit access (also yourself & Edmund).
2771	Are All the other People you have requesting edit access in Legal?
2771	On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days in London.
2771	You can send all those other people the Link (if it works) and they should be able to get in. If they are in Credit we will want them to have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more detail about the negotiation.
2771	And hopefully, input their comments about their negotiation to keep Legal apprised (we can always hope!).
2772	No time out for Tana.
2773	The cornbread is yours!
2774	Sorry you can't make it...
2775	Good job!
2776	Cute kitty, makes me want to get another kitten.
2776	It's hard to believe Frank ever looked like that, tho...!
2777	You should now have edit access for the financial trading database.
2777	Please only edit those entries relating relating to ECTRIC.
2777	Below is the icon which I hope should get you entry into the database (it's a shortcut, and I'm not sure it work in England, let me know and I'll stop sending it to people there if it doesn't!).
2777	Link -->
2778	You now have edit access to the financial trading agreements database.
2779	Jane, We have a Japanese counterparty on this list that wants to trade physical & financial pulp & paper.
2779	Any problems?
2780	L:ovely choice!
2781	Thanks for the info!
2782	The confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates.
2782	I will need some direction from the counterparty either via email or phone before I can send you a copy of the agreement.
2782	Sorry...
2783	I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby (well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!), I called Leslie at home at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company approved.
2783	We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for purchases only).
2783	No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff...
2784	Can you please put this counterparty in profile manager for me.
2784	We had a really old ERMS Master that restricted the types of financial products they could trade under it, and I want to take a look and see what we've got them approved for.
2784	They should be able to trade any financial products now.
2784	Thanks!
2785	On the ISDA replacement front, just a reminder that we want to put Morgan Stanley Capital Group at the forefront, we have an old Energy Price Swap Agreement in place with them, and then there's always our favorite, the old AIG "Master Master", now with Sempra, that raises a whole host of other issues...you were going to talk to Bill about that one...
2785	Do you want me to put them on the list for the Legal/Credit meeting as a reminder?
2786	As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar Swaps Online.
2786	As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed.
2786	What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions.
2786	Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the "Restrictions" contained in Lotus Notes.
2787	You are absolutely the best!
2788	I think we should stick with the standard so people can cook it at home if they like it.
2789	I will not be able get your Legal Group Access until I get their SAP Cost Center and Company Numbers.
2789	Their Profiles in the system are not complete.
2790	Any conflicts?
2791	Jake, If you would like me to email this to your customer I will need their email address.
2792	Below is the ISDA in electronic format as you requested.
2792	This draft is several years old and if you are putting a new one in place I would suggest you start from the newest version of the form and just use this to use as a blackline version.
2793	Is the counterparty known by the above ID Lyke Corporation or Ripon Community Printers, I'm confused?
2794	Attached is the NDA for Cargill you requested.
2794	At the direction of Mark Greenberg, I have added a non-solicitation clause.
2795	How has the GCP been set up?
2796	I forwarded a guy down to Credit on 5/9/01 from the referenced counterparty who wanted to get an ISDA in place with us.
2796	I told him he would have to speak to our Credit Dept. first, and from the tone of his voicemail it doesn't sound like he's heard from anyone.
2796	Can you make sure that someone calls him so he doesn't call me again.
2796	His name is Greg Bass and his no.
2796	is 619/696-3177.
2796	Thanks.
2797	Is this an individual?
2798	Is there an Inc. or Co. or something like that in the name?
2799	Thanks for following up on that.
2799	I got the counterparty to refax the document to us and Lorraine just got Andy to re-execute it.
2800	On this request, I meant "Users", not "Readers", so they can have edit access.
2801	On this request, I meant "Users", not "Readers, so they can have edit access.
2802	On this request I meant "Users", not "Readers", so they can have edit access.
2803	On this request, I meant "Users", not "readers, so he can have edit access.
2804	I bet Martin is going to have a different Company Code and Legal Cost Code than London.
2804	His info in the computer also isn't complete.
2804	Can you track that down for me.
2804	Thanks!
2805	What did you revise?
2806	Anna's information is not completed and I bet her cost center is different from yours (company the same?).
2807	I've got everyone's access submitted except Martin Rosell and Anna Reich and Oliver Harrison whose company codes and cost centers I will need.
2807	Justin, Mark Illiott, Robert Quick and Paul Simons already had edit access into the database and does your assistant Nicola Beales who should be checking that when she approves counterparties for EnronOnline (although I don't think the UK agreement are currently up-to-date, although they need to be for EnronOnline, it will save her a lot of time).
2807	I'm a little worried about your Credit people making changes.
2807	When you approve Credit people, warn them that they are should not make any changes except to Credit comments.
2807	Edmund will need to go in and add your Legal and Credit people to the Database Keywords as only he should have access to add Keywords.
2807	You might want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add.
2807	It's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done!
2808	On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the GTC).
2808	After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that company we'll know why.
2808	Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.
2809	Your request for our ISDA Password has been forwarded on to me.
2809	Below is the password.
2810	Would it be possible to ask some key people from our Credit Dept. to attend this semiar?
2811	Perfect!
2812	I heard about this kitty on the news but the didn't have any pictures.
2812	Thanks for forwarding it on!
2813	I have given the form to an attorney to review.
2813	As soon as he returns to his office I'll try and get a timetable for when we can expect an answer on whether their form is acceptable or not.
2814	Mark, when you send out documents can you put the counterparty's name in the subject line so when I'm looking for the documents I can find them easier.
2814	Much thanks.
2815	I will attend.
2816	New NDA for the Online Team, this time relating to ecommerce and business to business strategies.
2816	Any conflicts...
2817	Mark, Your header is wrong on the 4th page.
2817	The other pages say "David Berberian" and the 4th Page has some other guys name.
2818	So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some new business approaches Net Works is making with them.
2818	We'll need to possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this.
2819	It depends on the sophistication of the counterparty.
2819	I think Tembec is fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them I have already seen.
2819	For a counterparty that isn't, we have sample board resolutions we can send them, or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks.
2820	Andrea, I had Mark Greenberg, an attorney that works on EOL matters, review Green Mountain's form of CA and he much prefers ours.
2820	What he suggested is that you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that EnronOnline has a standard form of Confidentiality Agreement we prefer to execute our form.
2820	If the form meets with their approval we're golden.
2820	If they don't like it have them call me (and I'll just refer them to Mark!).
2820	Attached is our preferred form.
2821	An NDA for EOL, this time it would protect the counterparty so we can receive copies of their financial statements.
2822	I wanted to forward you directions to my house for dinner this Saturday.
2822	Alicia left me a voicemail and also suggested you bring your friend Kimberly.
2822	Please feel free to do so, the more, the merrier!
2822	I hope you will be able to make it.
2822	Everyone has responded yes, except John Hagood.
2823	They should be approved today.
2823	They were on last night's list.
2824	Good letter!
2825	We'll have to wait til Mark Greenberg gets in tomorrow.
2826	As long as we're all talking about vacations, I'm going to get mine on the board early.
2826	I would like to take the week of July 16-July 20 off.
2827	Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!
2827	Wherever you want to go...also, I need to get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.
2827	I've been thinking about you.
2827	Hope all is going well.
2828	Please call Carol.
2828	How about the Buffalo Grille, or is that too busy?
2829	Do I need to do anything?
2830	Per the attached memo from Mary Cook, an attorney in the Swap Group, and our meeting with members of Global Counterparty where we discussed problems with utilities of cities not being clearly identified, may I suggest the we rename GPP 98029, Norwich Public Utilities, something like, The City of Norwich, Connecticut?(which state?), by and through its Public Utilities Department.
2830	(The city utilities are at the bottom of the list.) Stephanie, we will also need them to resubmit their PA.
2830	Cheryl, we may need to confirm how we want to set this counterparty up before Stephanie send out the PA.
2830	Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361
2831	Lucinda will be joining us.
2831	I havent heard back from Holly.
2831	Maybe you might want to give her a call too.
2831	I'm sure she's a little stressed out right now!
2831	Maybe you could bring my bike & helmet when you come.
2832	Let's just keep it at 10 so we don't have to re-coordinate things.
2833	I don't have Holly's email address, I always call her.
2834	Another request for the EnronOnline Team.
2834	Any conflicts?
2835	Attached is "Annex B.doc" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for omnibus financial confirmations.
2835	About mid-way through the US Annex B is about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit only or letters of credit and cash.
2835	Following that is form of letter of credit.
2835	We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian counterparties.
2835	I have attached both.
2835	The law in Canada currently does not favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite problematic for us!).
2835	Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.
2835	The Canadian and US lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this advice changes.
2836	No problema!
2837	Will attend
2838	either day ok with me.
2839	Yes, I Fedexed it out for signature on Friday.
2840	I cannot approve any more old counterparties until Frank gets me that list show show what the counterparties said they wanted to trade when they sent in their password application.
2841	Is there supposed to be something attached?
2842	Federal Expressed!!!
2843	Can you handle this.
2843	I have no ideal what they're talking about.
2844	If you are looking for a copy of an ISDA Master Agreement with Exxon, there is none.
2844	If you are looking for a physical power master you need to contact Rhonda Denton.
2844	I have access to financial trading agreements only.
2845	Shouldn't these forms be placed in the atty.fms bank so all members of the swap team can get access to them...
2846	Engage Energy Canada is an Alberta corporation.
2847	I was a little concerned when I got this email and I discussed it with MarkTaylor and I just want to confirm with you, that you are responsible for anchanges to resolutions for UK online corporations and we are responsible foUS online corporations.
2847	No changes should be made to the EnronOnline, LLC or Enron Net Works Board Resolutions without going through me or Mark.
2847	I checked the EnronOnline minute books in the vault and unless I am plainmissing it I have not prepared and see no resolutions appointing Lara McKinney or Arfan as Agents and Attorneys-in-Fact to execute Password Applications (which is the only authority we would give them, not generalsigning authority for any other documents).
2847	I need to confirm whether youhave prepared any resolutions granting Lara & Arfan signing authority and iyou have I need to get copies faxed to me.
2847	Of course, I only care about Enron Online, the other two companies fall under your jurisdiction.
2848	My pleasure!
2849	Cheryl, Do you have their titles?
2849	Only a VP or above can sign documents.
2850	I need to approve, I'll approve today.
2851	Re: Pacific Forest Resources Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in the file, and there is no "Inc."
2851	at the end of this company's name.
2851	If you would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of Incorporation I will be happy to do so.
2852	Sure, just use me as as reference for getting a job.
2852	Let me know when you come into town.
2853	It's on its way!
2854	Can I expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a high rating?
2855	Louis, I went to fill in all that stuff, but they want to much personal information (like my address and phone number which I don't like to give out) and they won't accept the referral without it.
2856	No, I have not received the fully executed document yet from Steve.
2857	Sara, there is no paralegal yet working this deal.
2857	It is an old Susan Flyndeal and no credit has been received.
2857	Unless you appoint a paralegal to handle this I expect I will still be the paralegal that gets the snotty emails and phone calls from Jen and from Rich Lassander.
2857	Sara Shackleton Boyd/NA/Enron@Enron, Stephanie Panus/NA/Enron@Enron, Marie cc: Subject: Re: Nova Scotia Power I'm not sure who is handling.
2857	Tanya is supposed to prepare credit.
2858	I do not agree and I am discussing this with Justin Boyd in London before I (or Justin) responds to this Counterparty.
2858	Joe, can you take a look at their EOL trades and see if there is any particular reason why their trades might be taking more than 24 hours to get a confirmation out?
2858	Thanks.
2859	Justin, Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.
2859	I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the Atlantic.
2859	By the way, I heard you had some really good news.
2859	I'm so happy for you!
2860	Thanks for the email.
2860	Looks like we're not bad in getting their confirms out.
2860	After I hear from Justin I'll give them a call, hopefully tomorrow.
2861	This counterparty is a public corporation and a political subdivision of the State of Nebraska (a governmental entity).
2861	Sorry it took so long, I had to search the web and I just now had time.
2862	Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.
2862	West power was also in the queue for approval.
2862	We had previously had them approved for all power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open them up for all power.
2862	I thought it was OK to open them up for all power since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by you just in case...
2863	Thanks Justy, maybe you can just fax me a copy of your PA or ETA, so I can have a copy of the document when I speak to them.
2863	My fax no.
2863	is 713/646-3490.
2863	Thanks!
2864	No ISDA for Mitsui Corp. Below is the link which should enable you view access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2864	You can forward this email with the link to any member of your team and they will then have the link which will get them access to the database.
2864	Link -->
2865	Nothing for me.
2866	You are the best!
2867	No problem.
2868	I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing license.
2868	It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.
2868	If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get evidence of their power marketing license.
2869	Sorry, it was on the slow boat, in interroffice mail back from Steve, I just got it.
2869	I'll fax a copy back to the company today and follow with an original by fedex this everning.
2870	Do we have an NDA for The Chase Manhattan Bank.
2870	I kinda bet we do, but I kinda but we don't with respect to EnronOnline business...
2871	As you requested, attached please find a copy of the referenced NDA.
2872	Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in October?
2872	Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs of masters to have in place.
2872	I don't think we want either master to be the survivor master.
2872	With Chase we have an old 1987 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.
2872	Yuk, yuk.
2872	If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.
2872	I know it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master replaced by October.
2872	Do you think that's do-able?
2872	Do we have a contact at Chase/Morgan we can start dealing with?
2872	I'm going to add chase to the Legal/Credit list just as a tickler for us to get this thing rolling.
2873	Why did we change the name for the Board of Municipal Utilities of Sikeston, Mo.?
2873	That is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as how the name is set up on their website?
2873	I also spoke to their lawyer and he said that is how they transact.
2874	Steve, I am Mark's paralegal.
2874	Why don't you go ahead and fax that agreement to me at (713) 646-3490 and it will get the agreement signed and faxed it back to you.
2874	What is your fax number?
2875	Speedy Gonzalez retains his title!
2876	I feel your stock rising already!
2877	Whilst speaking to Koch about the Koch Hydrocarbons/Industries trades, they asked if they could get ISDA Masters in place with two other Koch entities we are currently trading with.
2877	The two companies are: Koch Petroleum Group L.P., Credit Contact at Koch is Arnold Lenz at (316) Koch Refining International Pte Ltd. a Singapore company, Credit Contact is in Singapore and can be reached at 65 835 20 27 (I don't know if Houston Credit or London Credit wants to handle this, I looked in the Master Swap Agreement database and I noticed that London sent them a draft in 1999).
2877	The Legal contact at Koch is in my database.
2877	It is a paralegal there, Pam
2878	Link -->
2879	Does this apply to us too?
2880	Can you please confirms NDAs for the two companies below.
2880	Much thanks!
2881	Thanks, as usual!
2882	I am going to need his address since the front of the ISDA is a pre-printed form and I can't email it.
2883	Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the division issue with respect to this counterparty: The following entities exist in GCP: 1.
2883	Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680): We would like this entity to remain OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".
2883	2.
2883	Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853): We would like all future trading with this entity SUSPENDED.
2883	There appears to be one trade under this entity and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
2883	3.
2883	Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197): We would like all future trading with this entity SUSPENDED.
2883	There appear to be no trades under this entity.
2883	With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
2883	I will let you all know when such side letter agreement has been executed.
2883	As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline and open them up for trading.
2884	I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the "Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.
2884	That approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you know.
2884	You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory with Mike Neves.
2884	Let me know when you can get in.
2885	Does this work for you?
2885	Is this where you want us to send copies of our signed documents and original guarantees?
2886	Any NDAs for referenced company?
2887	OK by me.
2888	This looks OK to me.
2888	Can we please change the subject to read: PLEASE REAMark Taylor (Vice President and General Counsel)@ENRON Sent by: Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON To: Taffy Milligan/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: DRAFT- Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption ApplGood morning Ms. Milligan, Please review and submit approval to Enron Messaging Administration.

Have a nice day, Gary Sta. Maria Enron Messaging Administration
2889	No, I don't ever believe we got this executed.
2889	Maybe we need to chat...
2890	I don't think it should go on the list so traders don't make a mistake and trade under it.
2890	Is that what you usually do Susan?
2891	All three of your access has been approved.
2891	Now you just have to figure out how to get into the system.
2892	Any NDAs for the referenced company.
2892	As usual, it's for EOL business...
2893	Please return our original copy of the agreement to me along with the copy of the cover letter evidencing that you sent the copy to Dynegy.
2893	Thanks.
2894	No, please send to me and I will handle.
2895	This has been sent down to Phillippe Bibi for signature.
2895	I have not received the signed copy back from Phillippe yet.
2896	OK for me.
2897	OK for me.
2898	What company are you with?
2898	To: "Mark Taylor (Vice President and General Counsel)@ENRON" Subject: RE: PLEASE READ Mark, Here at Enron Global E&P I have polled my CEO, Jeff Sherrick, and my CFO/CAHoward Selzer, and neither they nor I have anything to report.
2898	Am I supposed to poll everyone in the business unit -- 50 people in Houstonand 250 overseas?
2898	Stephen.
2899	OK w/me.
2900	Nope.
2900	Gosh, the suspense nearly killed me!!!
2901	Company policy (and corporate organizational documents) dictates that ALLcontracts may only be executed by an officer at the Vice President level orabove.
2901	I checked the Corporate Secretary's Records and they indicate thatneither Beth Perlman nor Richard Burchfield meet such requirements for EnroNet Works.
2901	Mark Greenberg directed me to get the agreement executed by Phillippe Bibi.
2901	Other officers we frequently get Networks agreements executed by are David Berberian, Managing Director, Greg Piper, Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer, Rex Shelby, Managing Director, or AndZipper, Vice President.
2901	If it relates to Commodity Logic, we can go to TomGros, Vice President.
2901	Feel free to approach any of this slate of officers to get your documents executed.
2901	cc: Corinna Bolender/ENRON@enronXgate, Mark Greenberg/NA/Enron@ENRON, John Hi, Tana.
2901	I,d prefer to work this at a lower level if possible.
2901	Could we get either Richard Burchfield or Beth Perlman to sign the MOU?
2901	Bob Ward Manager, IT ext.
2901	54409
2902	A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up counterparties under division or trade names.
2902	If the counterparties insist on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of the counterparty's name in GCP.
2902	For non-swap team members, you may want to forward this email on to your groups as well.
2903	Nope.
2904	I have a call into the EOL team about this one.
2904	I've tried to approve but no products will come into the queue.
2905	Beth Perlman, who IS a VP of Enron Corp.
2906	One note.
2906	We are currently negotiating some credit amendments to this agreement.
2906	cc: Subject: Enron Canada isda with Transalta Hi Tana, The executed ISDA list says that we,ve got one b/t Enron Canada and Transalta.
2906	Can I get a copy of the docs faxed to me asap??
2906	Thanks a lot, Enron Global Markets 520 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10022 Tel: 212.715.5283 Fax: 212.715.5608
2907	My emphasis on IS was just that she IS a VP of Enron Corp., not Enron NetWorks (which we found out yesterday she was not an officer of).
2907	cc: Mark Greenberg/NA/Enron@ENRON I know Beth Perlman is a VP of Enron Corp. ) that,s why I suggested she sign the MOU instead of Philippe in my email to you yesterday.
2907	I don,t understand your emphasis on the word &is8.
2907	Bob Ward Manager, IT - Development ext.

2908	You should have read access to our Financial Trading Agreements database which should allow you (since you are in legal and can view the confidentiacomments section) access to the comments.
2908	We are reducing counterparty'sthreshold.
2908	Take a look, and see if you can see comments now.
2908	cc: Subject: RE: Enron Canada isda with Transalta Which way?
2908	Enron Global Markets 520 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10022 Tel: 212.715.5283 Fax: 212.715.5608
2909	Yes, call Mike Neves at x33363.
2909	cc: Subject: RE: Enron Canada isda with Transalta I can,t get in. I need IT to look at it.
2909	Do you know the name of the IT guy in Houston that I can call?
2909	thanks Enron Global Markets 520 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10022 Tel: 212.715.5283 Fax: 212.715.5608
2910	No, I think this one is for you...
2911	Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and financial pulp, paper and lumber products.
2911	If you have any questions, please give Mark or me a call.
2911	Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European products as well?
2912	Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.
2912	The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.
2912	Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.
2912	I am proud to be an American...!
2913	Anne, Mark Greenberg will not be in the office for the next two days.
2913	Will you have time to look at this?
2913	Thanks!
2914	John wanted legal advice today, so I passed this email on to Anne Koehler for handling.
2915	Per my conversations with Brandon, I am enclosing a clean and blacklined draft of the NDA revised to reflect changes in connection with your prior confidential discussions with the counterparty.
2915	This form should be transmitted to the counterparty.
2916	Done.
2917	Done.
2918	I spoke to Norma at your store yesterday, and she said to send you an email to reserve a table.
2918	I am with the Enron Legal Dept. and we would like to reserve a table for happy hour on Friday at 6:00 pm for 10 people.
2918	We would like to have both wine and h'ors d'oeuvres.
2918	If you need additional information, or if there are any problems, please call me at 713/853-3399.
2919	Any conflicts?
2920	With today being Leslie's day off, do you have any problems with these counterparties extending their tenor to 51 months?
2920	This is a rush so I need to get them approved tonight.
2921	OK for Legal.
2922	You are the woman!
2923	We have two additional NDA's in addition to the Live Capital one.
2923	Any conflicts?
2924	I'll approve this on today's approvals
2925	Per my conversations earlier this week with Stephanie Sever and Wendi LeBrocq, I have sent down the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement and the three Password Applications necessary get the following three entities set up to start trading on EnronOnline.
2925	Per my conversation with Stephanie and Wendi, the counterparty would like the counterparty to start trading on EOL by tomorrow.
2925	The three entities are: 1.
2925	Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agent for and on behalf of Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE) 2.
2925	Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Ameren Generating Company 3.
2925	Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS) What if anything do we need to to to ensure that they can start trading by tomorrow.
2925	The counterparty is calling me daily checking on this?
2925	Can you please let me know?
2926	As you requested, I am enclosing a revised Mutual form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.
2926	As I stated in my earlier email, if you have any comments or questions, please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-3448.
2927	Janet, Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.
2927	We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you.
2928	I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank.
2929	No, I don't need one, but thanks for hunting that down!
2930	No executed NDA received.
2931	Who is Kevin Meredith?
2931	I only review counterparty lists I receive from Credit.
2932	Per my note below, please fax the agreement to me at the fax number below, and I will have it executed by an officer at Enron and return it to you via fax.
2932	If you would prefer to have originals executed, please send two executed originals to me, Tana Jones at 1400 Smith Street, 38th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002.
2932	I look forward to receiving the document.
2933	Your comments with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement have been forwarded on to me by Brandon Wax.
2933	After reviewing them, we have agreed to most of your comments.
2933	We have agreed to delete the arbitration provision but have retained the limitation of damages.
2933	Further, it is Enron corporate policy that the confidential information shall be limited to a term two years so we are unable to delete the final paragraph.
2933	Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel at (713) 345-8897 or email us and let us know if these changes meet with your approval.
2934	Sheila Tweed, the lawyer for this turbine product, has approved all of the counterparties on the attached list to trade this product, EXCEPT The City of Tacoma, Dept. of Public Utilities.
2934	Let me know if you need anything further from me.
2935	As you requested...
2936	NDA for CheMatch, any conflicts?
2937	I think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at Merita we negotiated the ISDA with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is OK to release the ISDA to you.
2937	The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258.
2938	Just a note...
2938	I have not gotten that ISDA Master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the Atlantic.
2938	I have asked Jay Williams in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.
2938	I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit.
2938	Just wanted to keep you updated...
2939	OK for me.
2940	Tom, With respect to this NDA, do you want us to send it directly to Deloitte, or do you want to send it to them?
2940	If you would like us to send it to them I am going to need an email address...
2940	Let me know what you prefer...
2941	No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.
2941	No word since then.
2942	You should now have access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
2943	Today.
2944	As you requested:
2945	Ran it by Leslie, OK for us!
2946	Thanks for the kind word!
2947	At the request of Anne Koehler, I am transmitting the final draft of the referenced Guaranty.
2948	I am sorry, but I checked with the lawyer, and we are going to need that executed Agreement and we are going to need it as fast as you can track it down...sorry to keep being such a pest!
2949	Any conflicts?
2950	As you requested, attached is the form of NDA for transmittal to your customer:
2951	Anytime!
2952	No time off.
2953	I'll take care of this...
2954	Janet, Would you like me to fax it to you?
2954	If so, what is your fax no?
2955	Janet, I also thought it would save you alot of time if you are going to draft a document if you had the word version, so I am attaching it.
2956	I am going away to the beach today so I am going to leave a little early today, at 2:00 pm.
2957	We deserve it!
2958	I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.
2958	I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.
2958	So, I am waiting on Credit...
2959	ALL of the swap form are now back in the attorney forms bank!
2960	Any conflicts?
2961	Anne Koehler & I had a quick call w/Doug Glass.
2961	Thanks for his name.
2961	We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).
2961	And NY law.
2961	Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.
2961	I also heard back from Justy.
2961	Thanks for your help.
2961	I really appreciate it!
2962	Justy, thanks for your quick response.
2962	I heard back from Edmund too, and he gave me the name of a V&E lawyer he has used in London for Russian law and Anne Koehler and I gave him a quick call.
2962	Doug Glass.
2962	So we switched it to NY law and ICC arbitration rules and are giving it a go.
2962	Thanks for your help!
2962	I can't believe our business guy call 2 hours before a lunch meeting with a Russian company and think it's business as usual!
2963	I just spoke to Stephanie Sever with the EOL team, and she said this counterparty has been approved and should migrate tonight and they will send them a password out tomorrow.
2964	I just agreed to the changes on the phone with Bob Klein and am going to finalize the agreement and fax it to him tomorrow and then follow-up with originals.
2965	Are you having our copy walked up to me?
2966	I know the online team is looking for people with paralegal experience.
2966	Your contact would be Lisa Lees.
2966	Lunch some other time?
2966	Thursday or Friday?
2966	I already have plans today and tomorrow...
2967	I'll put you down too!
2968	Done.
2968	I was waiting for the EOL team to get in a new Password Application and no one told me they got it in. I just went in and approved them.
2969	Per our conversation last week, please ensure that Mark Taylor and I are your initial point of contact with respect to compliance with and/or violations by Enron North America Corp. with respect to NYMEX position limits.
2969	Please fax Mark Taylor a copy of any correspondence with respect to our position limits.
2969	Your assistance with this will help us monitor and maintain Enron's compliance with NYMEX rules.
2969	In addition, if you are able to give us a call when you see an issue ahead, we may well be able to resolve it before it becomes a problem.
2969	As you requested, below is the contact information for Mark and myself: Mark E. Taylor Vice President and General Counsel email: mark.taylor@enron.com Sr. Legal Specialist email: tana.jones@enron.com
2970	At the request of Anne Koehler, I am attaching our word version of the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.
2970	Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service.
2971	What is the nature of the business you are discussing?
2971	Also, do you want me to send this by email?
2971	If so, I will need thir email address.
2972	Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.
2972	To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar: 1.
2972	"executed" 2.
2972	"executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master 3.
2972	"executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it 4.
2972	"executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master 5.
2972	"executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement Thanks for your attention herewith.
2973	Any conflicts?
2974	Brandon, I need the full legal name & address of this company.
2974	Thanks...
2975	Any conflicts?
2976	Another NDA.
2976	The correct legal name of this entity is Foundry Networks, Inc.
2977	He's already signed for our side.
2977	We're done.
2978	There is a meeting of the Name/Change Merger Group Meeting on Monday at 1:00 pm in 49c4 to talk about timing of suspensions.
2978	I don't know what, if any, relevance this will have for us, but since you do the name changes/mergers, I thought you might need to attend.
2978	I wanted to forward you the email, but once I clicked yes, I will attend, it went away.
2979	Xavier, what group are you in?
2980	NDA for COMYSY Information Technology Services, Inc.
2981	This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.
2981	You wre checking on their ability to trade power.
2981	Any update?
2982	Both I and Stephanie Panus plan on attending.
2983	I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.
2983	I'm passing this on to you for handling.
2983	Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.
2983	I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.
2983	He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit.
2984	Here is the guaranty from Trans Alta.
2985	Thanks for the email.
2985	I just got out of an all morning meeting.
2985	I had already drafted the agreement for APB Europe.
2985	I'll redraft it as directed.
2986	It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.
2986	Any dealmaker interested in business with them?
2986	If not, I think we should just inactivate them.
2987	OK for me.
2988	I spoke to Mark Taylor and we would like Dave removed from this corporation as well.
2988	We can date this revocation effective as of 10/1/01 as well.
2988	We really appreciate your help with these resolutions.
2988	I am circulating the EPMI resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed.
2989	Jay, I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.
2989	I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.
2989	Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).
2989	When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.
2990	We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.
2990	We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.
2990	However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.
2990	Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.
2990	Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.
2990	Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.
2990	We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.
2990	HOW GOES IT MARK????
2991	tom, All of this relates to a broker Bob Shults wants to open up to trade on EOL.
2991	When you have a minute can you give me or Mark a call so we can sort out who we want to trade with.
2991	Thanks.
2992	Another NDA.
2992	This one is for the New York Mercantile Exchange.
2993	Attached please find the NDA for transmittal to Bo Collins.
2994	We will also be getting these Mid-Market EIM Group Customer Lists on a going forward basis.
2994	I spoke to Credit and for right now we will only be approving these counterparties to trade physical steel.
2994	As with the regular online trading lists, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN ONE DAY, I will take it that you do not have any legal issues with the counterparties below trading.
2995	Know anything about these deals?
2996	Any conflicts?
2997	OK for you?
2998	How can we find out who has a clue?
2999	Nothing to report
3000	Not unless it's critical.
3000	All the attorneys are out at an offsite today.
3000	Can this wait til Monday or is this critical?
3001	I will get them done today.
3002	I will get them done today.
3003	Can you change on my calendar.
3003	Thanks!
3004	This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.
3004	They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.
3004	We figure they are using the website for price discovery.
3004	If I do not hear back from you within 24 hours whether London Legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals, it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products.
3005	Per Stephanie's request, attached is an updated list.
3006	I have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms.
3006	Kim.
3006	if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me I would be most appreciative.
3007	This counterparty has been updated.
3008	Pretty funny!
3008	If we could only do it for real!
3009	I got a call from my buddy Mike Mulligan with Paribas in NY last night asking me to see if I can't check with you on the status of the guaranty he is trying to get in place with Enron Metals Limited.
3009	He says he has been trying to get this in place with London for some time.
3009	Is there some particular problem holding up this guaranty?
3009	Is there anthing I can do to faciliate getting this guaranty to Paribas?
3009	Please let me know...
3010	I just had a voice mail from "Christine" at National Bank of Canada wanting to make a margin call and not knowing who here to call.
3010	Can someone please call her.
3010	Her number is 514/394-7567.
3010	Thanks.
3011	OK for me.
3012	Any conflicts?
3013	Erica, Is 2Advance Studios their correct legal legal name?
3013	Is there an Inc. or Corp. or anything there tacked on the end?
3014	If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue?
3015	Per our discussion, attached is the referenced NDA for transmittal to counterparty.
3016	We also have lots of agreements between internal counterparties.
3016	I also owe you more comments...I haven't forgotten...
3017	Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?
3018	I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.
3018	Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.
3019	There has been a little confusion about how this Counterparty wishes to be set up on EnronOnline, and after talking to the Counterparty, Darren Vanek in Credit, and Mary Cook we have come to the following agreement: The counterparty will be (and I think already may be?) set up in the GCP System as Vector Pipeline, LP I told the Counterparty that special Confirmation Templates would be prepared for this Counterparty and the signature line should be prepared as follows: Vector Pipeline, LP, by its Managing General Partner, Vector Pipeline, LLC By: _____________________ Name: __________________ Title: ____________________ This form of signature block should be used for all EnronOnline and any offline trades for counterparty as well.
3019	The Password Application has been executed by the Counterparty correctly so there is no need to have him re-apply.
3020	Patrick, Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?
3020	Is there someone entering the trades into the system?
3020	Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.
3020	Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.
3020	Can we find out who is doing them?
3021	This cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."
3021	We've got a few issues here.
3021	First, we just can replace profiles.
3021	If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.
3021	Is this?
3021	If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.
3021	I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc. I just can't move the profile.
3021	What's the scoop here?
3021	I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?
3022	On 10/17/01 List, is this an ECP?
3023	This was a good one, not a joke one.
3024	That was good Kyle.
3024	I have a few of the better bin Laden joke ones I'll forward on to you...
3025	Here's one of the two humorous things.
3025	I've been getting a lot of this bin Laden humor stuff, but these two are my favorites so far.
3026	Here's the other...
3027	This one isn't funny, but it's good...
3028	John, that was great!
3029	Re: Experian we need: 1.
3029	Full Legal Name and Address 2.
3029	Mark wants a more exact description of the nature of your discussions 3.
3029	An email address so we can send it directly to counterparty
3030	Any conflicts?

3062	Much thanks!
3063	No, only executed amendments.
3064	Sharon, BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.
3064	You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.
3064	THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!
3065	Please handle.
3065	Much thanks.
3066	Yes, everything.
3067	Sharon, did one of the Canadian lawyers look at the list for the things you could not identify?
3068	Larry, Can you send me the aricles and bylaws for another company, Enron Transportation Services.
3068	Much thanks, for ALL your help!
3069	You are the best!
3070	It sounds ok to me.
3071	Sheri, This project is very important to me.
3071	However, I am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all.
3071	I expect I am really the only one who will be giving you sustantive input.
3071	As well, I have other design modifications we will need to incorporate.
3071	I just wanted to give you a head's up because you are going to get ahead of me here for awhile.
3072	Can you take a look at all the Canadian Agreements listed on this list provided to us by BP and verify whether these agreements exist in Canada?
3073	You (as usual) are the best!
3074	Mary Cook wanted me to send you an email to make sure if you are sending the Master Netting Agreement out to counterparties that you delete the last page of the agreement, which contains the user notes.
3075	Teresa, By copy of this email, I am asking Stephanie Panus, another Paralegal in our group, to handle this for you as I am on working on a special project this week.
3075	Stephanie, per Teresa's voicemail, Cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us ASAP.
3075	Can you please give their attorney a call.
3075	Teresa, you forgot Mr. Gollomp's phone number.
3076	Thanks Sam, you're the best!
3077	Bob Shults is Asking about that amendment to the Amerex Fee Agreement.
3077	Can you help him...
3078	I would like to attend.
3078	God knows if Harry can/will come.
3078	We'll see.
3078	I did 12 (slow) miles last weekend...
3079	Running 12 miles was no problem.
3079	Harry & I had a little "tiff" (I hope only) this weekend, and as usual, he's out of town, so we haven't been able to talk.
3079	So who knows?
3080	I think yes.
3081	Anne also requested this.
3081	Kay young prepared and is emailing a copy to anne.
3082	Steve asked me to send an email asking if you haven't already begun drafting your agreements yet, when you name you agreement, please indentify them by the counterparty and the products such as "Koch Energy-Gas" or "Aquila Marketing-Financing".
3082	Thanks.
3083	Yes they are to prepare all the UCC filings.
3084	My pleasure.
3084	Reading all that should keep you busy for awhile!
3085	I don't know the answer to this.
3085	Do you?
3086	I am still using the list.
3086	I have to circulate the list to the team from time to time.
3087	Any idea who knows the answer to this question?
3088	Can you please handle.
3088	Thanks.
3089	I wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as Mark approves the changes.
3089	Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging.
3090	Name of Company: ERMT LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Address: 1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002
3091	Branches: only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.
3091	Restrictions: Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.
3091	It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.
3091	Examples would be: "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".
3091	You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.
3091	But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.
3091	Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF.
3092	Has this ever come in?
3092	Can someone please respond to Jennifer?
3092	Thanks!
3093	Can you please handle this for Chris.
3093	Thanks.
3094	Sam, Thanks for taking care of this!
3095	So far I'm on if I don't have to work.
3095	Harry and I broke up on Monday.
3096	I need to know what group Nekesha is in.
3097	You do not have to grant Nakesha access.
3097	She already has view only access as does any Enron employee.
3097	If you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database, she should be able to get view access to the database.
3097	All Enron employees have view access.
3097	Only employees of Legal and Credit can have edit access access.
3097	Does that help?
3098	We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.
3098	ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.
3098	We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.
3098	I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.
3098	Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.
3098	Much thanks!
3099	Edmund Cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people, credit people, companies, or change other drop downs in the database.
3099	I have key word access on this side of the Atlantic and Edmund has it there.
3099	If you need London Credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have Edmund go add them, or the company as a new key word.
3100	I am not aware of any changes, are you?
3101	Do I need to help you getting this out?
3102	Who was this passed on to for handling?
3103	I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.
3103	Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.
3103	Sorry about that!
3104	I'll give him a call.
3105	Nothing to report.
3106	Nothing from Legal.
3107	I faxed you the alcoa ISDA immediately after we spoke.
3107	It should be in NY right now.
3108	Mark and I were just discussing the project yesterday.
3108	I am out for Thanksgiving vacation all next week, but when I get back the week after that we definitely want to get it back on track!
3109	Sure thing!
3110	Do you have a full legal name for Equiva Trading?
3111	Any conflicts?
3112	Attached please find the NDA you requested.
3113	Attached please find a current list of the Networks, EnronOnline and CommodityLogic executed and draft Confidentiality Agreements for your review.
3114	Attached please find the referenced lists for your review.
3115	Sheri, I won't be back until that Thursday after Thanksgiving.
3115	You might want to re-schedule that meeting.
3116	Please send originals to me for handling.
3116	I will give a copy to you.
3117	It only shows a draft sent, no executed contract.
3118	Russell, I want you to be my friend forever, after all, you are my favorite, ex-Credit person!
3119	I just spoke to Stacey Richardson, and, with Georgi Landau gone, she said we should contact her, or Bridgette Anderson, with any Global Contracts questions for the time being.
3120	Can you please provide me with the clean copies of the licenses Angela is referring to?
3120	If I need to come pick them up to copy them, give me a call and I will do so.
3120	Thanks!
3121	Is there a Canadian power GTC?
3122	Let me know if I can be of further help.
3123	Attached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far.
3123	Tanya suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close-out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into Greg Whiting to see if that is the case.
3123	I spoke to Craig Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that.
3123	He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk.
3123	What are your thoughts on that?
3123	There appear to be two International Paper Deals.
3123	Craig Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.
3123	There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.
3123	Craig, any knowledge of this other one?
3123	No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no.
3123	Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no.
3123	49011.1 for $442,000.
3123	That just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on Debbie's list with no copy.
3124	We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C. The room situation is as follows: Team A: Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies Team B: Main Conference Room 32c2 Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof Currently no working phones in this area.
3124	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies Team C: Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
3124	Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.
3124	Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.
3124	I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.
3124	After looking at the areas, Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.
3124	SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.
3124	We have a fourth area available after this for Team D: a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.
3124	2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance.
3124	We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.
3125	Weren't we also going to get a printer in the area?
3126	Lance, Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.
3126	Much thanks!
3127	You are the best!
3128	Travis, I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.
3128	We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy.
3129	Lance, I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.
3129	Is that doable?
3130	Mary Cook wants me to put together a list of people's home ph, cell no's/pagers, in case we need to call in help during the holidays.
3130	Can you provide me with your info in case we get surprised and have to set up additonal data rooms.
3130	Much thanks!
3131	Thanks Lance!
3132	I can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are.
3132	Can you meet with me?
3133	It appears that the fax you moved in on the 33rd floor was actively being used by Scott Tholan and his assistant on that floor (x58889).
3133	Can your people please move it back ASAP and find us another one.
3133	Thanks.
3134	Any update on these faxes?
3134	I have to get my list to Louise Kitchen today.
3135	Lance, Did we replace the fax machine we erroneously took on the 33rd floor?
3136	Already done.
3136	See you tonight!
3137	I saw you across the dining room at Luther's but you left before I got a chance to wish you a Happy New Year's.
3137	I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week.
3137	I'll have to take your class and you can explain to me how you went from lawyer to weathercaster.
3137	Happy New Years again, and let's hope this year is better than the last!

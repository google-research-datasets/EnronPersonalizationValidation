0	I have another meeting from 2:00 - 3:00pm.
0	I would only be available for the first 30 minutes.
1	Gerry, Lindy and I are going to tag team on this.
1	She and I will get together on the results of these meetings.
1	Thanks, Kim.
2	Lindy Donoho will attend for our group.
2	Thanks, Kim.
3	Mara, I have a monthly outtage meeting to go to from 1:00 to 2:00pm.
3	Can I just come late?
3	Has everyone in our group committed to a time to test with you yet?
3	I would like to test with you tomorrow after 1:30.
3	Let me know what works for you.
3	Thanks, Kim.
4	Mike, I'm sorry I accidentally deleted you off the distribution list when I was putting this together and didn't realize it until this morning.
4	My apologizes.
4	Thanks, Kim.
5	Bill, To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).
5	Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.
5	She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.
5	They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.
5	It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.
5	I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.
5	You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.
5	Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
5	Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
5	I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
5	Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
5	Keep us posted.
5	Kim.
6	FYI, Kim.
7	Theresa, I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?
7	Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?
7	Thanks, Kim.
8	FYI, Kim.
9	TK, since you, Steve and I are traveling tomorrow, could you work with Lynn to schedule this meeting for Wednesday.
9	You, for sure, need to be there.
9	Thanks, Kim.
10	FYI, Kim.
11	FYI, Kim.
12	Dot, I'm so glad you know what the problem is.
12	My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.
12	He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.
12	Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?
12	Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?
12	Keep me posted.
12	Thanks, Kim.
13	Gary, I just wanted to get back with you on the Salt Dome Storage question you asked earlier.
13	I have not been able to find anyone in TW who has knowledge of exploring it, but per Kevin's recent message, it looks like SWG is beginning to pursue it.
13	Do you have any comments or thoughts?
13	I will be in Omaha on Thursday of this week for a RM meeting, maybe we can hook up for a few minutes and visit about this.
13	Thanks, Kim.
14	I'll come see you after lunch.
14	Thanks, Kim.
15	I would like to attend the Legal Essentials for Managers training on August 22.
15	Thank you, Kim Watson
16	John, Hi, I got your voice mail while I was out of town.

23	Kim.
24	Jean, thank you so much for taking care of this for us!

24	Thanks, Kim.
25	Hi Stephanie, By chance are you available for lunch today?
25	Kim.
26	Mary, You are going to have such a great time!
26	Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.
26	You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.
26	A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.
26	Is your jacket water wary?
26	Tennis shoes are definitely OK!
26	You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.
26	Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.
26	Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).
26	Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.
26	Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!
26	Call me when you get back.
26	I'd love to hear all about your trip!
26	Hugs back at you, Kim.
26	P.S.
26	Stay away from Haggus(spelling?).
27	Sasha, This looks wonderful to me.
27	Thank you for all of your help.
27	Will you be with us during our day?
27	If you are available, I would love for you to be there with us.
27	Also, can you help us coordinate ordering Pizza from Bira's to have during the Mad Potter event?
27	Morgan, should we just drink the wine and beer from the Mad Potter vs. bringing our own?
27	If Morgan is good with the memo, go ahead and distribute.
27	Thanks, Kim.
28	Hi Debbie, Can you tell me who you have talked to?
28	Michelle is the Oneok rep and is out of town until Monday.
28	I will ask Michelle to assist you in this collection.
28	Michelle, would you please coordinate with Deb and see if you can find the right person a Oneok for us to talk to regarding the AR issue.
28	Thanks, Kim.
29	Lou- Can you help with this?
29	Thanks, Kim.
30	FYI, Kim.
31	Here they are.
31	They are thin this week, lots of things in progress...
31	Thanks, Kim.
32	How about Wednesday?
32	Kim.
33	FYI, Kim.
34	Jerry, Steve Harris asked me to get with you and coordinate any outage planning input that you need from our group.
34	Please let me know how I can be of assistance.
34	Thanks, Kim.
35	FYI, Kim.
36	Steve, do you know Rodger Swenke with SoCal?
36	Kim.
37	Unfortunately, I do not know Rodger.
37	I sent this message on to Steve to see if he knows of him.
37	Thanks, Kim.
38	I believe that John and I will have to pass on this one.
38	John (and I must admit that I, too) cannot afford to partake in any kind of all you can eat anything.
38	Our buttons are popping now.....
38	Have fun on this one.
38	Eat a tail or two for me.
38	Thanks, Kim.
39	Opps, can I scoot you to Thursday?
40	Yes, I will be there.
40	Thanks, Kim.
41	TK, I think it would be a good idea for you to attend this meeting, also.
41	Thanks, Kim.
42	Can we meet on Monday?
42	Perhaps after the TW staff meeting which ends about 3:30 to 3:45.
42	Kim.
43	Shelly, Steve does not know him either.
43	Kim.
44	I've got Thursday booked.
44	Thanks, Kim.
45	I will also be taking vacation on Friday, Stptember, 28.
45	Thanks, Kim.
46	John, I've been out of town this week, but I did want you to know that I received your message.
46	Fran Fegan is our HR rep and she can help you and Karen coordinate the paperwork.
46	Thanks, Kim.
47	Hey Tiny, Thanks for your voice mail regarding Griffith.
47	I will scout it out on Monday and let you know if I hear any confirmation of the water supply.
47	Gee, I hope it's not true.
47	We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing.
47	I believe that HR will be sending out the invite.
47	I thought it would go out this past week, but I'm sure you'll see something early next week.
47	We will start at 8:00am on the 8th and go until about 7:00 or 8:00pm.
47	We will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston.
47	Thanks, Kim.
48	Craig, Can we get together and talk about this?
48	I was out of town several days last week, and as I look at it now, I want to make sure I understand the questions that Rita is asking and I'm wondering if we need to do something different with the way that we fill out the deal sheet.
48	Can you help me comb through this?
48	I'm in the office all next week.
48	Just let me know when it is convenient for you.
48	Thanks, Kim.
49	Richard, These summaries are great!
49	Our desk is starting to get more of a commercial focus on these imbalances.
49	May I ask you to put a date on the actual spreadsheet?
49	As I keep them from week to week, I find that I can't always tell which one is the most current summary.
49	Many thanks and see you in the next Tues.
49	meeting, Kim.
50	Lindy and TK, would you guys be available to sit in on this meeting?
50	Thanks, Kim.
51	Ramona, where will this meeting be.
51	I've asked that Lindy and TK sit in on this.
51	Thanks, Kim.
52	Jean, Let's book lunch on the 10th.
52	Let's talk early that morning to confirm time and flavor of food.
52	I'm looking forward to it!
52	Thanks, Kim.
53	When we get together on Wed for our staff meeting, would you please speak to this to our group.
53	Please let us know if we need to change our behavior on anything.
53	Thanks, Kim.
54	I will be there!
54	Sasha, I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.
54	Would you please make sure they get an invite.
54	Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.
54	Thanks for your help.
54	Kim.
55	Audrey, would you please book me a conference room for Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 for about 4 people.
55	Thanks, Kim.
56	Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls), Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.
56	The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.
56	To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) : Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
56	Imbalances on OBA's Analysis of I to I spreads.
56	- Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.
56	Would we have made more money?
56	Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
56	Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG.
56	West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
56	Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
56	Pooling.
56	Analysis of our business sold and utilized.
56	FT, Alt.
56	Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points.
56	(On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information) Weekend on call schedule - update Phones Update - replacement for Jeff's position.
56	Frequency of our staff meeting.
56	Industry Conferences Vacation Schedules Also, please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting.
56	I would be happy to include them.
56	Thanks, Kim.
57	Sasha, Great, sorry, I didn't see the scroll bar.
57	Thanks!
57	If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's, that would be great.
57	I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections.
57	I would order plenty for our hearty crowd, someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning!
57	Also, will the Mad Potter provide the wine, beer and soft drinks?
57	Is there anything else that you can think of?
57	Thanks, Kim.
58	Sasha, I forgot one thing.
58	Let Morgan and I know if you get any declines for our session.
58	Thanks, Kim.
59	Good Morning Kirk, I hope you had a nice weekend.
59	I have been working on the Interconnect Agreement for the Big Sandy Project and I would like to schedule some time for a telephone conference with you as I have a few "blanks" in the Interconnect Agreement that I would like to discuss with you so that our draft is as complete as it can be.
59	Would you have some time on Tuesday AM or Wednesday AM?
59	I would also be available on Thursday 2:00-3:00pm.
59	I'm thinking we need about a half an hour.
59	Also, I can update you on the remaining capacity on our Red Rock Expansion which could be used to serve the plant.
59	Thanks, Kim.
60	Paul, Thanks for the update.
60	Even though last week there were no translated financial statements for MGI, I'm glad that they have them now and will be sending them to you.
60	Jorge and I are scheduled to talk tomorrow morning to discuss the rate.
60	I will keep you posted.
60	Thanks, Kim.
61	Rod, Thanks for your comments.
61	They will be incorporated into the next draft that I route.
61	I expect to hear from Jorge tomorrow regarding their thoughts on the proposed rate.
61	I'll keep you posted.
61	Thanks, Kim.
62	We will meet after the morning meeting tomorrow to discuss these imbalances with Market Services.
62	If you are available, please plan to attend.
62	Thanks, Kim.
63	Privileged and Confidential Spreadsheet
64	Alma, Please invite Lindy Donoho to this meeting.
64	Thanks, Kim.
65	Steve, I just wanted to let you know that I have been playing telephone tag with a couple of the Questar folks.
65	For the most part, they were out of the office several days during the last two weeks (of course I was out of pocket a couple days, too) .
65	I've left another message with Gary Schmitt, who apparently is out of town yesterday and today, but I did hear from Mary Kay Olson, who was also in our office when Gary came in several weeks ago.
65	Mary Kay is tracking down the status of the Western Leg information that Kevin requested.
65	I also let her know that we are interested in the Eastern Leg as well.
65	She will begin pulling that information together, too.
65	I expect to hear from her either later today or tomorrow with a status and timing of the data.
65	She will also connect up with Gary when she sees him.
65	I will keep you posted as I hear more information.
65	Also, Jodi Starley (who is also in the Questar Marketing department), is looking for me to begin the Interconnect Agreement for the San Juan Hub connect with Southern Trails .
65	Do you have a problem if I begin the paperwork, however, I have several other Interconnect Agreements that are higher priority at this time and it may take a while to get to this one?
65	I recognize that this is a delicate balance.
65	Thanks, Kim.
66	Audrey, I took 1/2 day vacation on Friday, July 20.
66	Thanks, Kim.
67	FYI, Kim.
68	Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?
68	I'm very glad that this passed.
68	Thank you for your help!
68	Kim.
69	Greg and Maria, FYI.
69	Here is a report for the July Capacity Releases on TW.
69	PG&E, Sempra and Texaco all released on an Index to Index spread and are above max rate.
69	Elizabeth has the history of TW Capacity Releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates.
69	Thanks, Kim.
70	Ramona, Gosh, something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems.
70	Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her.
70	We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools.
70	If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change, but it is too early to make a decision just yet.
70	I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process.
70	I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are, but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year.
70	I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow.
70	Thanks, Kim.
71	Michelle, Was this the company you just took derivatives class from?
71	Thanks, Kim.
72	FYI, Kim.
73	Vince, I'm so glad that you can recommend him for our commercial job.
73	He has some skill sets that our department is shy on.
73	In fact, I am bringing him back for my boss, Steve Harris, to interview.
73	I too, think that he would be a good fit.
73	By the way, Krishna and Seksan have been very helpful in coordinating some technical analysis of California prices.
73	We appreciate the support and certainly enjoy working with your group.
73	Perhaps you, Krishna and I can book a lunch together in mid to late August and catch up on the business issues.
73	Thanks, Kim.
74	Hi Kirk, I got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office.
74	My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning.
74	Next week looks wide open.
74	Would you mind waiting until next week?
74	I just want to make sure we are not holding you up.
74	Let me know your preference.
74	By the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?
74	Thanks, Kim.
75	Here it is.
75	K.
76	Great, Thanks!
76	Kim.
76	Shirley, please keep me posted on Krishna's new baby.
76	Thanks, K.
77	Kirk, How about talking at 10:30am CST on Friday, August 10?
77	My day is pretty flexible, so if another time works better for you, please let me know.
77	Thanks, Kim.
78	Elizabeth, Please read below.
78	Can you help us put together a summary of the TW Capacity Releases from Nov. 00 to Aug. 01?
78	We are in the process of putting our strategy together on our Neg.
78	Rate hearing.
78	Is it possible to assemble this soon?
78	Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.
78	Many thanks, Kim.
79	FYI, Kim.
80	FYI, Kim.
81	Lindy, can you respond to this?
81	Many thanks, Kim.
82	Steve, We are still confirming whether or not TW has had other I to I deals negotiated in the past.
82	So far, TK, Lorraine and Michelle don't think that we have any, but I will talk to Lindy tomorrow.
82	Here are some NNG I to I neg.
82	rates that have been approved during the past year.
82	I will keep you posted.
82	Kim.
83	By the way, I don't think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today.
83	Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July.
83	Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.
83	TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.
83	The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.
83	Thanks, Kim.
84	Lou--while you were on the lake...
84	Thanks, Kim.
85	Can you help with this?
85	Per my conversation with you earlier today.
85	Thanks, Kim.
86	More unsubscribed capacity reporting....
86	Thanks, Kim.
87	Not sure how this impacts us.
87	FYI, K.
88	Bullets, please.
88	Thanks, K.
89	I've got it booked.
89	I'll give you a call.
89	Thanks, Kim.
90	FYI, Kim.
91	FYI, Kim.
92	Shirley, Let's book Tuesday, Aug. 28.
92	Thanks, Kim.
93	Glen, Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?
93	Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?
93	Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?
93	Many thanks, Kim.
94	Audrey, here they are.
94	Thanks, Kim.
95	Lindy, FYI.
95	Kim.
96	Lindy, Just in case you could not see the Word.doc.
96	K.
97	Drew, If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW then take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible for the difference?
97	This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity in different packages of time.
97	KW.
98	Hey Kevin, Thanks for the message.
98	In fact, I talked with Glenn Hass about this earlier today.
98	I also talked to Questar about this today as well.
98	Gary Schmitt was somewhat optimistic, but he had not seen the full order yet so he was still reserved.
98	I'll keep you posted.
98	Thanks, Kim.
99	Thanks, Audrey!
99	Kim.
100	Thanks Lindy.
100	Have a good time in sunny California!
100	K.
101	Larry, Please take a look at this spreadsheet.
101	I welcome and encourage any and all comments you may have on this.
101	Please feel free to make changes my wording as well as the spreadsheet itself.
101	As we move this forward, I will want to attach a current version of your NYMEX Technical Update.
101	Many, many thanks for all of your help and support on this matter!
101	Kim.
102	Glen, Interesting reading from one of our customers.
102	Kim.
103	Glen, This is very interesting reading.
103	Please read this (sorry, it's kind of long) and let me know if it meshes with what you think is happening in California.
103	Thanks, Kim.
104	Larry, here is draft #2.
104	Again, many thanks!
104	K.
105	Lorraine, When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.
105	I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.
105	We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.
105	Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.
105	Thanks, Kim.
106	Jean, all is correct except that Steve Harris should get two flat screens instead of Michelle and me getting a third panel.
106	However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for Michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.
106	Is there an extra one around for her?
106	Many thanks, Kim
107	FYI, Kim.
108	I do not believe that I am familiar with this company.
108	Kim.
109	Jo, Here is a copy of the open season that is being posted late today for a TW expansion from San Juan to Phoenix and California.
109	Please mention it in the morning meeting tomorrow since we are off campus in a strategy meeting, and we will walk through it with everyone in the Friday morning meeting.
109	Thanks, Kim.
110	Thank you, Audrey.
110	By the way, the marketing team is off campus tomorrow in a strategy session with Facility Planning.
110	Call me on the cell phone if you need me or anyone else on the team.
110	(713 416 5059).
110	Thanks, Kim.
111	Jerry, Unfortunately, our marketing department is off campus tomorrow with are Facility Planning group and will be unable to attend.
111	We will catch you next month.
111	Thanks, Kim.
112	Kay, Thanks for the update.
112	Actually, I did not realize that Jeff's computer had Prophet X on it.
112	I would like to get together with you in the next few days and discuss the software package with you.
112	We may indeed wish to keep a user on it but I would like to understand it better.
112	I'm out of the office tomorrow, but will be back in on Thursday.
112	Thanks, Kim.
113	Paul, Just in case we need bigger translations, see below.
113	Thanks, Kim.
114	Thank you, Randy.
114	Kim.
115	Lee and Denise, FYI, Kim.
116	Steve, FYI.
116	Kim.
117	Thanks for the future dates.
117	I'll try not to schedule any more conflicts with this time......
117	:>).
117	Kim.
118	I'll will try to have them by 4:00pm.
118	Thanks, Kim.
119	You bet!
119	Can we meet at 11:20 or 11:30?
119	I would like to be back for a 1:00 pm meeting.
119	Have you been to Daily Review Cafe lately?
119	It is just outside of Downtown off of Dallas St. I would be happy to drive.
119	Thanks, Kim.
120	How about we meet you at the Met.
120	Lindy and I will be in the 3AC until lunch.
120	Meet you there at 11:30.
120	Thanks, Kim.

172	Thanks, Kim.
173	Audrey, email from home works differently than the office.
173	I hope this attaches this time.
173	Sorry.
173	Thanks, Kim.
174	I got it....Kim Watson
175	I have a tentative Spires Board meeting.
175	I should know in the next week or so if that is a firm date.
175	If it is not, then I would love to be at Perry's with you.
176	I probably prefer the 3 or 17.
176	Let's get the rest of our invites together this weekend.
176	ILY, K.
177	Steve, Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned outage next week for two days.
177	We will talk with their commercial folks on Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.
177	We anticipate that we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead with their September business as usual.
177	We will also talk with the other SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down the lateral while Burlington is down.
177	Thanks, Kim.
178	I love this report.
178	How often will you send this out?
178	Thanks, Kim.
179	Jan, FYI, on remaining outages for 2001.
179	Thanks, Kim.
180	What do I need to do with this?
180	Should we be talking to our customers?

180	I just want to make sure that I'm not letting anything slip through the crack.
180	Thanks, Kim.
181	How was this meeting?
181	Any additional capacity identified?
181	Thanks, Kim.
182	Michelle, Did everything get paid?
182	Is all resolved?
182	Thanks, Kim.
183	I was informed by Lone Star that they have not completed their transaction with Sid Richardson and they will continue to take deliveries from TW until further notice.
183	(I suspect that they may not sell this asset, after all.) Assume no sale for now, I will keep you posted if anything changes.
183	Thanks, Kim.
184	Dan, I do not understand what this message means.
184	Please advise.
184	Kim.
185	Michelle, Any luck helping Debbie with this?

188	I would like to attend the 10/31 session.
188	Will the training be in the morning?
188	Thanks, Kim.
189	Mary, I got your voicemail last week.

189	I am very ready........Will you be coming to Houston this fall?
189	Thanks, Kim.
190	Steve and Dave, As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index deals.
190	Here are my thoughts...
190	For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 could impact our fuel risk.
190	Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for this transaction.
190	All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract will have to be provided by TW.
190	In a normal year TW over collects approximately 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.
190	Because we will now need some of this over collected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have something less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collection.
190	To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assume after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.
190	We will need the remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.
190	Let's also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seasonally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.
190	The remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal.
190	It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d of the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.
190	On any day where Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually burned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.
190	The other shipper's in-kind fuel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actually used to provide fuel for Dynegy.
190	On this particular day, we do not have additional adverse price risk.
190	However, on any day that Dynegy does not have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity loss on the value of this fuel.
190	If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.
190	This means that we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provided by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this particular day.
190	Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash prices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a price that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunity loss.
190	Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?
190	Would you agree that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow?
190	Thanks, Kim.
191	Rich, Can you help us in defining how we can participate in the Laguna festival?
191	Steve, TK and I are available to participate on Tuesday, Sept. 18.
191	We would have to be able to leave Albuquerque around the noon hour on Wednesday, Sept. 19.
191	Thanks, Kim.
192	pricing are falling more.....Cal 02 is now $3.27.
192	EOL still does not have Perm Basis posted for Cal 02, but we suspect that it is in the $.11-.14 range.
192	FYI.
193	Yikes, another message.
193	Thanks, Kim.
194	Hey guys and girls, Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip.
194	I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights.
194	I received an immediate response from the Hotel Condotti.
194	They have 3 standard rooms available.
194	I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).
194	From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.
194	They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.
194	The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).
194	It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.
194	They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our reservation.
194	I think we should go with this.
194	I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the others, if at all.
194	Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.
194	Thanks, Kim.
195	11:30 in the lobby sounds fine.
195	I would be happy to drive.
195	Thanks, Kim.
196	Yes, I will be there.
196	Thanks, Kim.
197	John, I will be able to make the Thursday meeting.
197	I will be out of the office on Friday afternoon.
197	Thanks, Kim.
198	Steve, FYI, prices this morning are still hanging in the $3.10-3.13 range for Permian Cal 02.
198	We are watching it closely.
198	I'll keep you posted if it starts to rally back up.
198	Thanks, Kim.
199	Steve, We have a contract extension for Sempra, 30,000/d from La Plata to I/B Link extending it from 12/31/01 to 12/31/02.
199	Max rate.
199	Standard language.
199	I would like to approve this contract in your absence.
199	Legal and Regulatory have already approved.
199	Thanks, Kim.
200	Rich, My fax number is 713 646-4095.
200	Thanks, Kim Will you be there, also?
201	I will approve Sempra deal.
201	Danny is out of the office today, but he will be in tomorrow.
201	I'll still keep you posted on prices if they begin to move.
201	Thanks, Kim.
202	Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.
202	I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.
202	I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.
202	She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car).
202	FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.
202	Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.
202	I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.
202	Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.
202	She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.
202	I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.
202	She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.
202	Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.
202	We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.
202	I will keep you posted as we hear more.
202	Thanks, Kim.
203	Steve, James ran numbers.
203	$.22 for 10 yr.
203	for 43,300/d is a DCF of 16.57% with no resubscriptions.
203	This looks better than any of the 5 year cases on either a 120/d case or 150/d case.
203	Thoughts?
203	We have not approached Duke with a 10 yr term yet.
203	Thanks, Kim and Michelle
204	Audrey, Would you please set up a meeting for me on Wednesday (tomorrow) to discuss the Griffith plant and some of the problems we have been having lately with respect to TW's responsibilities, EAMR's responsibilities and Trigon's responsibilities.
204	(Please share this meeting purpose in the email notice of this meeting.) We would like to meet from 3:00 to 4:00 pm, we need a conference room in Houston with the ability to conference in several other locations.
204	In addition to the names below, please include Don Hawkins, Sarabeth Smith, Donna Scott, Dennis Alters, Darrell Schoolcraft and me.
204	Many thanks, Kim :>)
205	Are you online?
205	MSN shows you not logged in. BTW, my car is ready.
205	I will pick it up tonight.
205	It was the starter.
205	$550 (includes a new battery).
205	PS.
205	I will keep you posted on the ferry poll.
205	I still vote for arriving in Lucca earlier in the day, only because if we don't arrive untill evening, then we will spend the whole next day in Lucca instead of getting to Florence.
205	I'm trying to keep us (you and me) whole for 2 - 2.5 shopping days in Florence before heading to Rome.
206	Do you have a problem if I call Duke tonight to initiate a 10 year discussion?
207	I talked with Russ.
207	I told him if he wanted a 5 year, we needed $.26.
207	We could consider going a little lower if he extended his term to 10 years....I told him we really need $.24 to make it work for 10.
207	He will run the numbers and call me in the morning.
207	Kim.
208	Jo, here is the message on the EPNG Marketing Affiliate case.
208	Thanks, Kim.
209	Great, would you reply that we may need up to six chairs, but we will know the exact count within the next week.
209	Also, ask her about a table cloth to see if we can borrow it.
209	Thanks, Kim.
210	I will ask Audrey to coordinate our calendars for marketing.
210	We will let you know.
210	Thanks, Kim.
211	FYI, Kim.
212	Hey guys, We got our first response to a Florence Hotel.
212	Please read this message and take a look at the attached links to their hotel website to get a feel for the location.
212	Janell and I think that it is close enough to the city center, but we are open to fresh eyes.
212	Let me know your thoughts.
212	I sent about 12 faxes this morning, this is the first to respond.
212	Janell has personally called about 8 hotels in Florence and they have all been fully booked.
212	Let me know what you think.
212	Thanks, Kim.
213	9:00 works best for me.
213	I can swirl other stuff for 10:00, I would not be able to do 11:00.
213	Thanks, Kim.
214	Another response.
214	I think it is further away than Hotel City?
214	Can anyone look at a map and tell us?
214	It's crazy at the office today and I won't have time.
214	Thanks, Kim.
215	10 yr.
215	deal not looking good.
215	I have a call into Russ about taking some of the resubscrip space that starts 6/03.
216	FYI, on resubscription space, if we sell 2,000 6/03 and incr.to a total of 7,000 4/04 thru 5/31/07 at $.22, to keep a 15% DCF we have to sell the 43,300 at $.218.
217	Paul, I think this bounced back to me.
217	Sorry.
217	Kim.
218	Darell, this works fine for me.
218	Where do yo want the Houston folks to go?
218	Thanks, Kim.
219	Audrey, please review.
219	It looks OK to me.
219	Do you have any more suggestions?
219	Thanks, Kim.
220	Jerry, you can remove me from your distribution of NNG only outage reports.
220	Thanks for all of your help and coordination on the TW outages.
220	Kim.
221	Jan, do you want to be on this distribution list?
221	Please let Craig know if you do.
221	Thanks, Kim.
222	Audrey, I took 1/2 day on 8/17 and I'm taking 1/2 day on 8/31.
222	Thanks, Kim.
223	Donna, would you please check this distribution list and let me know if you think we might have accidentally omitted someone that should have received an invite?
223	I don't want to leave anyone out that should come.
223	Thanks, Kim.
224	Audrey, I think I know the schedule for the Laguna Festival.
224	Let's get together tomorrow and discuss.
224	Also, I will need airline tickets to San Antonio for late next week.
224	Thanks, Kim.
225	I'm sorry to keep changing my mind, but I would now like to attend the 10/17 class.
225	Fran informed me of another Leadership training class that is on 10/31-11/02 that I would like to be able to attend.
225	Many thanks for your patience.
225	Kim.
226	Robbin, Please forgive me for not sending this in by Aug. 15.
226	I've been caught up in several heavy projects and forgot to put it all together.
226	I have all my info in a big envelope and I will get it sorted in an organized fashion and get it to you in the next few days.
226	If this is a problem, please let me know.
226	I would be happy to discuss this with you.
226	Again, I apologize for the delay.

266	Hi Dan!
266	I am glad that your family is well.
266	My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC.
266	I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.
266	I will be glad to bring the tape in. I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk.
266	We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor.
266	I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too.
266	Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses.
266	I will bring it as well.
266	Thanks and take care.
266	Kim.
267	FYI, If you are available, I would like for you all to attend.

269	Kim.
270	Susan, I just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in Eric's group (plus Steve Dowd) have a place to land when we move.
270	I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack.
270	Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?
270	Thanks, Kim.
271	Steve, here is the Pemex draft.
271	Kim.
272	Dave, here is a draft letter to send to Pemex.
272	Please give me your thoughts or changes and we'll get this out today.
272	Thanks, Kim.
273	Hi Pam and Donna, I am not certain that Susan has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (Eric Gadd's group) with respect to the move.
273	In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with Susan as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in. Susan will also coordinate Steve Dowd with the rest of Eric's group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.
273	Susan, Please let me know when you have accounted for everyone in Eric's group (plus Steve Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment.
273	The goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops.
273	:>) Thanks to all for your help!
273	Kim.
274	Michelle, please put another packet together on Southern Trails for Mike McGowan.
274	Some of the pieces may have to be faxed/mailed if you don't have them electronically.

275	May I have her phone number and email address again?
275	Thanks, Kim.

277	Hi Ken, Would you please add Paul Y'Barbo on this distribution list.
277	Paul is one of our new marketing reps and will be involved with our risk management strategies including our fuel positions and how it relates to this report.
277	Thanks, Kim.
278	Mark and Paul, It would be good to set up a time to demo this model.
278	In fact, I would like to attend with you, since I havn't seen it for almost a year.
278	Thanks, Kim.
279	Rick, Thanks so much for the lead!
279	In fact the timing is very good since we are trying to determine a viable scope of the Sun Devil expansion.
279	Lorraine, would you please give Rick Padia a call and see if there is a fit for us to service his area.

279	Thanks, Kim.

282	Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.
282	We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop.
282	FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.
282	Thanks, Kim.
283	Audrey, Count me in the office during this time period.
283	Thanks, Kim.
284	Mike, Jorge sent these changes to me, but I thought you might want to take the lead on these possible changes since it is a NNG IT contract.

293	It is very standard.
293	It is reimbursable.
293	It has a few blanks that have to be filled in for certain dates that we (or Caithness) don't know just at this time with respect to receiving regulatory approval, in-service date, etc. Caithness wants this agreement for their prospective equity partners to review for content.
293	Teb, Lee and Ron, this agreement has not changed since you have last seen it, but I just wanted you to give it one more look.
293	I would like to email to Kirk (Caithness) tomorrow afternoon.
293	Thanks, Kim.
294	Thank you, Julie!
294	Kim.
295	What were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?
295	Didn't we offer all three weekends?
295	I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel during the week of Thanksgiving.
295	Thanks, Kim.
296	sounds good.
296	K.
297	Susan, Thank you, but I will be out of town on Mon and Tues of next week and will not be available to attend.

297	Thanks, Kim.
298	Dear Jorge, Per our conversation on this past Monday, here is the letter we talked about.
298	We have an original that will be placed in the mail today.
298	Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.
298	We look forward to hearing from you soon.
298	Sincerely, Kim.
299	Jorge, My apologizes, a slight typo in the Trans Pecos name in last paragraph.
299	Here is the revised memo.
299	Thanks, Kim.
300	Although we expect to receive specific feedback on our July 6, 2001 proposal to Pemex for the TransPecos Pipeline very soon, we sent the attached letter today to Pemex (with a copy to Kinder Morgan) that will withdraw our proposal on October 1, 2001 if the LOI has not been executed.
300	Kinder Morgan has agreed with the sending of this letter.
300	Pemex has been aware of the contents of this letter since Monday, September 17.
300	We will keep you posted of our detailed discussions with Pemex as they proceed.
300	Thanks, Kim.
301	Dave, as you can see I mis-typed your email address on the original sent to Jorge.

301	Thanks, Kim.

306	Thanks, Kim
307	FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.
307	He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.
307	If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.
307	Kim.
308	Ron, would you please give me your thoughts on Kirk's question.
308	Thanks, Kim.

311	Thanks, Kim.
312	Lindy, Since the tolerance range is currently on the whole contract on a monthly basis, can we force the daily balancing issue?

312	Thanks for the note.
312	Kim.

333	Hey gang, I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto).
333	I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning.
333	Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled.
333	I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation.
333	Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.
333	I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.
333	Let's start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip.
333	If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June?
333	Any thoughts?
333	Thanks, Kim.
334	Steve and Teb(for Steve Veach), Please review the attached work order for the tap and side valve for the new Agave interconnect.
334	Please forward an email message to Robert Geheb giving him your approval on this work order so that he may begin working with the appropriate people to get the materials ordered.
334	We are under a very tight time frame and we don't want to loose anytime.
334	The "paper" will follow to you shortly for signiture, but this email approval will keep the process moving.
334	Also, as soon as we work out the remaining details with Agave on the remaining costs, we will revise the work order to include the items that Agave will be constructing for us as well as provide the economics for the interconnect.
334	This, too, will be routed to you for your approval.
334	Please let me know if you have any questions.
334	Thanks, Kim.

335	I'll call you when I get back.
335	I'm still OK taking off tomorrow and next week.

359	FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from Nanci MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I'm not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization.
359	Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations.
359	I'm not sure we've ever been clear on this.
359	Please continue to talk about Red Rock with these folks.
359	What would Aquila like to see TW offer?

538	Throw me a couple of dates that may work for you.
538	Thanks,
539	I will be there.
539	Thanks, Kim.
540	FYI, Kim.
541	Jerry, FYI, Jan and I may be late for this meeting since we are taking her to lunch to celebrate her 20 years of service.
541	If we miss this meeting, may we touch base with you by phone to get any pertinent info on TW.
541	Also, we want a recap on any stories or jokes that you tell!
541	:>).
541	Many thanks, Kim.
542	It is that time of year....
542	Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.
542	Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.
542	Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.
542	As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.
542	Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.
542	I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.
542	:>) Thanks, Kim.
543	Mark, This looks fine.
543	Kim.
544	Paula, I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.
544	I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.
544	If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.
544	It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.
544	Let me know when you would like to rally.
544	Thanks, Kim.
544	P.S.
544	Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!
544	I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!
545	I will be on vacation this day, however, I am planning on coming in for the board meeting in the evening.
545	Thanks, Kim.
546	Jan, FYI, Kim.
547	Hi Phyllis!
547	I am so excited to get to see you this weekend!
547	I sure hope all is well with you.
547	It looks like you and I have been assigned the dinner for Saturday evening.
547	I am open to ideas for recipes!
547	Let me know when would be a good time to visit on our assignment.
547	I will make time for you anytime.
547	Thanks, Kim.
547	:>)
548	Mary Kay, What is the usual process on something like this?
548	Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?
548	What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?
548	What is the timeline for FERC to decide?
548	Thanks, Kim.
549	Sorry, I had a typo in your address below.
549	Here is the message.

551	Thanks, Kim.
552	Audrey and Steve, FYI, I have an eye appointment on Thursday at 4:00pm.

552	Thanks, Kim.
553	Paula, Can I catch a ride with you?
553	Thanks, Kim.
554	Yes.

559	If so, please let Perry know that you are the marketing contact.
559	If not, please let me know so that I can pass it on to someone else.
559	Thanks, Kim.
560	Paula, Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.
560	Some of the names we mentioned last night were: Bill Tarter Lenore Fenberg Muffin Alfred Any other names that come to mind?
560	.....Will Eucker, Art, Tammi Semi, Carolyn Brown, Ken O'Neill...
560	are other people who have been involved in various efforts.
560	Your thoughts?
560	Thanks, Kim.

561	I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss.
561	I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.

583	Thanks, Kim.
584	Kirk, Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.
584	I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.
584	Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe.
584	I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.
584	Thanks for keeping me posted, Kim.

587	Steve and Teb, Please find attached the agreement for Questar Southern Trails I/C with TW in the San Juan Hub.
587	It is very standard, just like the Agave agreement.
587	Fully reimbuseable.
587	Please let me know if you have any comments.
587	Thanks, Kim.
588	Blair, per my voice mail message.
588	If you can, would you please review and let me know if you have any comments.

588	Thanks, Kim.
589	Dear Gaylen and Jodi, Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San Juan area.
589	The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.
589	This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.
589	Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range.
589	Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.
589	Thanks, Kim.
589	P.S.
589	I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.
589	I will send it under separate cover.
590	Dear Gaylen and Jodi, I was having technical difficulty in sending this drawing with the I/C agreement.
590	Here it is.
590	Please let us know if you have any questions.
590	Thanks, Kim.
591	Yes, I will wait for you.
591	Thanks, Kim.
592	I wanted to send a note to let everyone know that the rate for the firm transportation agreement with Agave (K#26490 & #26606) increases by $0.01 for all volumes west and east effective November 1, 2001 through October 31, 2003 as follows: New Rate For West Flow volumes of 70,000 MMBtu/d - $0.15 (#26490) For East Flow volumes of 40,000 MMBtu/d - $0.07 (#26606) If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

595	Kevin, Would you have some time today or tomorrow to discuss this?
595	Also, we should rally with Kevin Hyatt to discuss his ideas on Sun Devil and determine if we can use a similar strategy for Trans Pecos.
595	My calendar is pretty open, just let me know what works for you and I'll coordinate with everyone.
595	Thanks, Kim.
596	I wanted to see if you were interested in going over to High Fashion (Smith@Elgin) during lunch.
596	I'm looking for some velvet ribbon to tie our flood salvaged ornaments onto our skinny short Christmas tree.
596	Kim :>)
597	Count me in!
597	Thanks, Kim.
598	Sam, I wanted to catch up with you and see how you are doing.
598	Are you in?
598	K.
599	Bill, Here are the changes to the OBA.
599	Please review.
599	Also, please look at para 5(c).
599	Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.
599	So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.
599	Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?
599	Thanks, Kim.
600	Jan, Will you be able to attend this meeting today?
600	I've got a couple of conflicts in my schedule this afternoon.
600	Thanks, Kim.
601	3:00 works best for me.
601	K.
602	Let's catch up tomorrow.
602	It's been a tough couple of weeks, uh?
602	K.
603	Kevin, We are looking for the TW logo.
603	We'll keep you posted.
603	Kim.
604	I'm trying to message you.....K.
605	Rosemary, My cell phone number has changed.
605	It is 713 416 5059.
605	Thanks, Kim.
606	Kevin, We are putting a list together for lost value for all of TW including the Trans Pecos project.
606	We will get this to you by the end of the day.
606	If your timing is different than this, please let me know.
606	Talk to you soon, Kim.
607	All, Joe is able to meet with us at 10:00 Thursday, December 13 in EB1336 to discuss the OBA language as it relates to our ability to enforce dollar value, cash out and other provisions in the OBA with other intra and interstate pipelines.
607	Please plan to attend.
607	Thanks, Kim.
608	Danny, Per your request, if Red Rock was delayed, it would have a $1.1MM impact for June and a $1.6MM impact for July.

624	Paul and Mark, Please contact Eastern New Mexico (Mark), Enervest (Mark), Citizens (Mark) and Southern Utes (Paul) to make sure they are aware that they are responsible for making the payments on these contracts since ENA has defaulted.
624	Also, Paul, please confirm again that ENA is not nominating on their own contracts that make up $129,481 of the delinquent payments.

626	Kim.
627	Paula, Thanks for your note.
627	I'll give you guys a call around 6:00.
627	I only need the critical one or two loads and actually, we only need the washing machine since our dryer still works.
627	Thanks for the kind offer of Chinese, but we've got several gifts to wrap for the office tomorrow so we'd better stay focused.
627	We truly appreciate your kindness!
627	Thanks, Kim.
628	Craig, I'm sorry, I didn't redline this...Please take a look, call me so we can discuss then we can send it back to Tony P. for another review.
628	Many thanks, Kim.
628	PS.
628	We don't want to tender this until they send in a request.
628	I'm working on that now.
629	Hi Sylvia!
629	Please use this email as approval for Mark McConnell to have access to the Envision system.
629	Hope all is well with you.
629	Have a Happy Holiday!
629	Kim.

634	Kim.
635	FYI, Kim.
636	FYI, Kim.
637	I wasn't sure you responded to this yet, but we are in Hong Kong the weekend of Feb. 15.
637	Let's not forget to talk to Valentina (sp?) tonight at JFF.
637	ILY, K.
638	Bill, I've made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method.
638	Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement.
638	The letter looks great to me.
638	Thanks for all of your help on this.
638	Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.
638	Thanks, Kim.
639	We are drafting a letter to Sid Rich for their non-payment of $1.6 MM Nov. invoice.
639	You will find the letter in your email.
639	TK has water-dropped Sid Rich that a letter is coming this afternoon.

642	Thanks, Kim.
643	Dan, Thank you for the great card.
643	I hope all is well with you.
643	What are you doing now?
643	Are you still commuting to California?
643	Are you working for someone in Houston?
643	ENE is up today to $0.63.
643	Gosh, it still feels like we've got the decimal point in the wrong place with our stock.
643	Just heartbreaking.
643	Oh well, I'm glad 2002 is here.
643	This will be a better year for all!
643	Keep in touch!
643	Happy New Year to you and your family!
643	Kim.
644	J, I don't have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept. I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.
644	I'll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.
644	I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02.
644	If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8.
644	If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.
644	Have a great day!
644	ILY, K.
645	Jim, We would like to call you at 1:30 today to discuss the Sid Rich payment for Nov. business.
645	Are you available?
645	We'll call you.
645	Thanks, Kim.
646	Come on down to 13.
646	We'll be in 1336.
647	Mark, Will Maria or Dorothy be able to attend and provide their historical knowledge?
647	I've got it booked on my calendar.
647	Thanks, Kim.
648	Lorraine, Can you bring Martha's laptop back to the office?
648	I had originally told her we only needed it while you were out with your sinus surgery.
648	I'd like to go ahead and return it to her.
648	Thanks, Kim.
649	Please plan to attend a meeting on Monday, January, 7 from 3:30pm to 4:00pm in EB49C1 to discuss the Trans Pecos Project.
649	Thanks, Kim.
650	No, I was not aware of this.
650	Thanks for taking the lead on this, please let me know if you need my assistance.
650	Thanks, Kim.
651	Yes, the 1:30 is the prep meeting to the 3:30 Stan meeting.
651	Danny wants us to look at project financing vs. MLP.
651	If you get a chance, call me Monday when you get back in the office and we can discuss a little further.
651	Happy New Year.
651	Kim.
652	Glen, Are you familiar with this organization?
652	Do we normally participate?
652	Thanks, Kim.
653	TK, FYI, let me know if you think otherwise.
653	Thanks, Kim.
654	I will check.
654	We are in 49C1 which is a very large conference room and I'm thinking the phone is off to the side by some side chairs and may not have a long enough cord to stretch to the table.
654	I will inspect and keep you posted.
654	Thanks, Kim .
655	Audrey will be in for only a bit this morning.
655	Please send me bullets by 10:00am.
655	Thanks, Kim.
656	No problem!
656	Have a great day!
656	Kim.
656	:>)
657	Audrey, here they are.
657	Thanks, Kim.
658	The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border.
658	Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate.
658	They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal.
658	I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan.
658	We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex.
658	I will make myself available at your convenience on Monday morning to discuss.
658	Have a great weekend.
658	Kim.
659	Please read.
659	Can we schedule a conference call time with Gaylen on Monday?
659	Kim.
660	I need help on "WUFBR, SMATB" -------Forget bring refreshments?....Sunday morning?......
661	Happy New Year, Gaylen!
661	Would you be available on Monday at 11:00am (CST) to discuss?
661	I am routing the OBA to the key departments for comments.
661	I should have the language for the IT agreement finalized late today or Monday morning.
661	I hope to send it to you and we can discuss in our phone call.
661	Let me know if this works for you.
661	Thanks, Kim.
662	Julie, We need an earlier time on Monday to have the prep meeting for Trans Pecos (it is currently scheduled for 1:30).
662	Can you tell me what Danny's calendar looks like?
662	Our meeting with Stan is at 3:30.
662	Thanks, Kim.
663	We have a floor meeting with Stan on Monday at 1:30 to discuss the Dynegy deal.
663	See announcement below.
663	Kim.
664	Ron will be with me, so we will have to go to a conference room as well.
664	I'll let you know our phone number Monday morning.
664	Thanks and have a great weekend!
664	Kim.

668	Thanks, Kim.
669	Due to the 1:30 floor meeting with Stan, our prep meeting for the Trans Pecos project is changed to today, Monday, January 7 at 11:00am in EB1336.
669	Thanks, Kim.
670	When do we break bread with Art and Donna?
671	I've not seen this, but I would like a copy of the article when you locate it.
671	Thanks, Kim.
672	FYI, Kim.
673	FYI, Kim.
674	FYI, Kim.
675	FYI, Kim.
676	Steve, This just came in from Gary Sova.
676	FYI, Kim.
677	To All, Please send me bullets by lunchtime on Thursday so I can give them to Steve by the afternoon.
677	Thanks, Kim.
678	I need to take our cat to the vet tomorrow morning (Tuesday), so I may be a little late---approximately 8:30am.
678	Thanks, Kim.
679	Jodi, Here is the language for the IT agreement.
679	We will need for you to send in a formal request form for IT service so that we tender this officially.
679	We can chat about this in the morning.
679	Thanks, Kim.
680	Steve, Here is the final spreadsheet that does tie back to the right dollar amount of $757,885.
680	Please let me know if you need anything else.
680	Thanks, Kim.
681	Jo, Here it is.
681	Thanks, Kim.
682	Ron, John would like to know what our HP is at these units and what type of units are they?
682	What is the age of the equipment?
682	Is this something we would be willing to share?
682	I told him that our run time on these units was less than 1,000 hours.
682	If we are OK sharing this info, would you either call him or email this to him.
682	If we don't want to share, just let me know and I would be happy to call him and let him know.
682	Thanks, Kim.
682	John Davis' phone number is 281-610-1333, his email is john.davis5@worldnet.att.net
683	This looks good to me.
683	Question: Is there a tax/CIAC issue with Citizens reimbursing us for this change?
683	Will there be an addition to our property accounting records to reflect a change to a pressure control system?
683	Because it's only $5,000, there may not be an issue, but I just wanted to check.
683	Kim.
684	Steve, FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.
684	However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo's RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.
684	Martha and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months.
684	Thanks, Kim.
685	TK can sell Feb-Dec to Sid Rich for $2.27.
685	Or sell remaining Jan, Feb and March for $2.01.
685	We can sell 10,000 for Feb/March.
685	We can look at only selling 5,000 for rest of year, leaving 5,000 to catch upside(or downside).
685	We need to at least sell Feb/March before 1:00pm AGA report today.
685	Are you OK with this?
686	John, Congratulations on your new responsibilities!
686	Please let us know if there is anything we can do for you.
686	Good Luck!
686	Kim.
687	Steve, James re-ran Trans Pecos with the following: Term: 20 years Rate: $0.261 Cost: $130.274MM (Without cost of NNG I/C and over-run up to $143.9MM) then ROE: 12.38% If Cost is capped at $130.274 (no over-run), then ROE is 15.25% Term: 15 Years Rate: $0.261 Cost: $130.27 (Without cost of NNG I/C and over-run up to $143.9MM) then ROE: 10.82% If Cost is capped at $130.274 (no over-run), then ROE is 13.8% Let's discuss tomorrow morning.
687	Kim.
688	Steve, Yes, we are already putting a list together and inviting customers.
688	We are primarily concentrating on the Houston and Dallas customers.
688	We'll get the RSVP list together in the next day or two.
688	Let us know if you have an invite, we do not have all the tickets spoken for at this time.
688	Michelle has organized dinner for us at Farrago (corner of West Gray and Brazos) after the show.
688	They are setting up a large table in the back of the restaurant for us.
688	Kim.
689	FYI, Kevin Hyatt left me a voicemail last night when he found out about this open season for a new storage facility.
689	Let's discuss after everyone has a chance to review.
689	Thanks, Kim.
690	Yes, we did see this, thank you.
690	TW plans to be at the informational meeting in Houston next week.

694	Thanks, Kim.
694	:>)
695	Audrey, I am waiting on Mark, Michelle and TK.
695	They are working on them.
695	I'll have them to you ASAP.
695	Thanks, Kim.
696	Audrey, here they are.
696	Thanks, Kim.
697	No problem.
697	Thanks, K.
698	All, We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.
698	Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.
698	Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.
698	If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.
698	The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.
698	Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?
698	Thanks, Kim.
699	Tracey, I received a phone call yesterday from Mika Aswell (spelling?) from Lea County, NM.
699	Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.
699	Here is what we know: Amount: $7.36 Check Date: December 17, 2001 Invoice Date: 1-1-2001 #676-3004-0 Voucher: 0100001479 Purchase Order: A60KD13882 Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.
699	Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.
699	Many thanks, Kim X33098
700	I believe it will be Questar Southern Trails.
700	I'll confirm this for you.
700	Kim.
701	Thanks Morris!
701	Will you guys be able to call Mika Aswell and let her know your results?
701	Thanks, have a great weekend.
701	Kim.
702	Hi Sherri, Well, your ears must have been burning.
702	I have been thinking about you this week.
702	Gee, a lot has happened since we last spoke.
702	I'm still here.
702	We are very busy on Transwestern.
702	I would love to catch up with you, are you available by phone sometime next week?
702	My calendar looks pretty open next Tues, Wed or Fri.
702	I look forward to visiting with you soon.
702	Kim P.S.

702	She is with the Northern Natural side, I'm with Transwestern.
703	Thank you, Amy for checking this out for us.
703	Have a great weekend.
703	Kim.
704	FYI, Kim.
705	Steve, Early this week I asked Jo for a rate and the size of volume (looking for the max volume) we could have for transportation on NNG from WT to PH(NNG/TW Gray).
705	I've got a couple of follow-up calls into her, but she has not gotten back to me yet.
705	I hope to have a response from her before we meet with Mike Stage on Tuesday.
705	I'll keep you posted.
705	Kim.
706	Looks like their new name?
706	......Global.....Transportation.....BBBBB???
706	bucket, bag, banner?
707	Let's meet after the staff meeting today to discuss carving out existing capacity for June 1 as well as what, if anything, we say to the shippers for now.
707	Lorraine, would you please bring the volume needed for Red Rock contracts for June and July.
707	If we carve out existing capacity, we still may not have enough for al of them without prorating.
707	Thanks, Kim.
708	Several of us in our shop are going.
708	We are splitting up between Wed and Thursday.
708	Kevin is going on Thursday.
708	Kim.
709	FYI, Kim.
710	Thanks, Lynn.
710	Kim.
711	FYI, Kim.
712	Julie, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.
712	We had been currently utilizing Kay Treat and Sean Bolks for LIM information.
712	Should we coordinate with you?
712	Please advise.
712	Kim.
713	Hi JB, I just wanted to follow up with you.
713	I have not seen the invoice for the work that you guys did on the new interconnect.
713	I'm concerned I may not be getting all my mail.
713	Have you sent it yet?
713	Just checking.
713	Thanks, Kim.
714	Julie, Lorna, Kay and Sean, will not be available as a resource to me starting February 1 because of the Dynegy situation.
714	Will need our own access.
714	Please advise.
714	Thanks, Kim.
715	All,
716	Audrey, I have no off duty time to report for this period.
716	Thanks, Kim.
717	If TK has access, that is all we need.
717	Thanks, Kim.
718	Jo, I wanted to follow up with you on the O&M charges and transportation capacity from Halley to Gray.
718	Do you have some telephone time available soon?
718	I'm available late today after 4:00 or tomorrow before 10:30 or from 1:30-3:00 or Wed anytime pm.
718	Thanks, Kim.
719	Will you handle this?
719	Thanks, KIm.
720	Jo, Let's talk on Wednesday at 3:00.
720	I can call you.
720	Thanks, Kim.
721	Steve, I know that we are meeting with Mike Stage and group tomorrow at 3:00.
721	I've been trying to talk with Jo and will do so this Wednesday regarding transportation on the KB line to NNG/TW Gray.
721	Kim.
722	FYI, Kim.
723	Yes, 9:00am on Thursday will work fine.
723	Also, just FYI, Transwestern is off on a holiday, Monday, January, 21 for Martin Luther King day.
723	Talk to you Thursday, Thanks, Kim.
723	:>)
724	Great job, TK!
724	:>) Kim.
725	Gina, I like it.
725	I think it is very nice.
725	I know that employees will be glad to see this finally announced.
725	Thanks, Kim.
726	Given that the first week of Dec was the bankruptcy filing, I don't show any lunches out during this week.
726	I don't believe it was me.
726	Can you tell by the price how many people may have been at lunch?
727	Jo, FYI, Kim.
728	Do we have a plan to transfer all the PNR activity to the TW team for Feb 1?
728	Thanks, Kim.
729	FYI, We'll keep you posted as the responsibility for this changes.
729	Kim
730	FYI, Kim.
731	You are so fast!
731	Many thanks!
731	Kim :>)

732	Also, at this time let's discuss more of the details of how we want to operate our own meeting starting next Tuesday.
732	Thanks, Kim.
733	Steve, FYI, you are more than welcome to join us for this meeting or sit in our new 8:00am meetings starting Tuesday, Jan 22 in EB1336.
733	Thanks, Kim.

736	:>)
737	Tiny, I wanted you to know that I am putting a "check in the mail" to you (and made out to you) in the amount of $50 to be used toward the gift for Rich.
737	The money is from: Mark McConnell - $10 Kim Watson - $20 I apologize I didn't get it in the mail earlier this week, but everyday seemed to be a Monday for me this week.
737	If you have Rich's home address, I would love to send him a note.
737	Thanks for coordinating this!
737	Kim
738	Definitely not me.
738	I would have charged a lot more than this!
738	Ha!
738	Thanks, Kim.
739	Audrey, this is good to book!
739	Thanks, Kim.
740	Bill, This looks good.
740	Thanks, Kim.
741	Here are the weekend flow levels.
741	FYI, Kim.
742	Dennis, can we talk about this?
742	Thanks, Kim.
743	Dennis, What are your thoughts on this request?
743	I'm not even sure that our map department exists because of December 3.
743	If we respond to her request, we may want someone at an officer level at the Navajo Nation to request this data and then send it directly to the officer.
743	Thanks, Kim.
744	Bruce and Dave, For your review and input, here is the latest version of the LOI for Pemex.
744	Mark and I will come over this afternoon and spend just 15-20 minutes with you and walk you through some of our thoughts.
744	Thanks, Kim and Mark
745	Steve, Well, TK celebrated 20 years with Enron on January 11.
745	I did talk with Fran about the status of service awards, and of course, they were suspended in December.
745	Fran said that they are having discussions about what to do in the future.
745	It may be a while before this program gets reinstated (if at all).
745	Until it does, may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK?
745	Kim
746	Kevin, For Trans Pecos, we have a couple of slides with a fact sheet prepared that we used in the presentation with Stan a couple of weeks ago.
746	Would you like those or are you looking for a 2-3 page narrative?
746	I'd be happy to provide either.
746	What is the time frame - how quick?
746	Kim.
747	I will send the fact sheet now.
747	However, I am happy to create whatever you need to help get this money.
747	I'll send it under separate cover.
748	Kevin, Per your request, here is some basic information on Trans Pecos.
748	Please let us know if you need additional information or prefer it in a different format.
748	Thanks, Kim.
749	Would you please send me your bullets by the end of today (before we leave for the Cirque show).
749	Thanks, Kim.
750	yes, K.
751	Any luck connecting up with the ENA folks on the capacity release for February?
751	Kim.
752	looks good.
753	Hi Bill, Have you had a chance to review the OBA that Questar sent us?
753	If you have time later today, we could get together and discuss.
753	Thanks, Kim.
754	If you need assistance, please let me know.
754	I know Ruth, she actually worked in our group a couple of years ago.
754	Do you think we'll get an answer so we can sell before bid week ends for Feb business?
754	Kim.
755	Please plan to attend a TW analysis meeting tomorrow morning, Friday, January 25 from 9:00am to 11:00am in EB1336.

756	Keep Market Services plugged into your conversations with the customer.
756	Thanks, Kim.
757	Bobby, Thanks for your help on this.
757	Let's talk early next week to see where you are on this and whether or not you will have to implement the interim plan.
757	Thanks, Kim.
758	I can come, but I will be about 15 minutes late due to our weekly Gas Control meeting at 3:00pm.
758	I'm happy to join up with you in progress.

765	Bruce and Dave, Here are some of our comments to amend the KMI/TW letter agreement for dates listed in the agreement.
765	Please review and lets discuss tomorrow morning.
765	We are putting together a timeline for all of the various things that need to happen which will help us both determine the new dates to put in the letter.
765	We'll send this to you as soon as we are finish.
765	Do you have any comments on the Pemex letter agreement?
765	Thanks, Kim and Mark.
766	Mansoor, I can make either time work, my preference would probably be Wed 1:30-3:00 if given a choice.
766	Would you like for all of Marketing to be there or would you prefer to keep it small with just Michelle and me?
766	Thanks, Kim.
767	Yes, I can make myself availble for this meeting.
767	Can we discuss either later today or tomorrow for a pre-meeting?
767	Thanks, Kim.
768	Well, I spoke too soon.
768	I just got word of another meeting that I need to attend Wed at 1:30.
768	My preference now is Tuesday from 9:00-10:30.
768	Thanks, Kim.
769	I've got it booked.
769	Who else from our shop would you like to see attend also?
769	Kim.
770	does that mean just me?

772	All, Please take a look at the spreadsheet, call your customers regarding these outstanding amounts and keep Market Services in the loop of your conversations.
772	Please let me know of anything unusual.
772	Thanks, Kim.
773	Hi Dot, Well, we've been talking about Italy again.
773	We are looking at leaving late May, like Friday, May 24 (so we can scoop in Memorial Day) and returning to Houston on Sunday, June 9.
773	We are pricing fares now.
773	Continental has them posted on their website at $1,100-$1,200.
773	I will also check with Alliance Travel Agency (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) to see what they may be able to do for us.
773	Can you and Tom swing these dates?
773	Let me know.
773	Thanks, Kim.
774	How quickly?
775	Do you have your resume together?
775	Any leads?
776	Rudy, I am so glad that you have landed!
776	Thank you so much for the phone mail message you left me.
776	I would love to schedule lunch with you in the next couple of weeks to see how you are doing.
776	We'll grab Martha, too.
776	Congratulations!!
776	Kim.
777	I work for Transwestern Pipeline at Enron and I would like to have an ID and password to use Clicktrip.
777	Please advise.
777	Thanks, Kim Watson
778	Jeff, I am looking for the person who paid for my wine last Friday evening.
778	Lorraine says it was not her, so I'm suspecting that it was you.
778	Needless to say, I left without paying and what is worse, I didn't even think of it until I got home that night after dinner with John.
778	Where you the kind and unknowing one that floated my loan?
778	Also, I've been thinking about Paris and London.
778	Would a week night or weekend night be better for you/Lisa and John/I to get together for a brain, map and book transfer session.
778	If you have a date that works for you guys over the next few weeks, throw it out and we'll get something on the calendar.
778	Thanks, Kim.
778	P.S.
778	What is Lisa's email address?
778	I'd like to send her a note.
779	FyI, Kim.
780	Audrey, Here is another request for maps, however, I am thinking that I sent this person to you yesterday.
780	If this is repeat request, please disregard.
780	If not, please handle.
780	Thanks, Kim.
781	Do you want to pre-meet?
781	Are we still scheduled to meet tomorrow at 1:30?
781	Location?
782	Jan, would you make 5 copies of the power point slide.
782	I'll print out the word documents.
782	Thanks, Kim.
783	Steve, Jan and I will print out 5 copies of each of these.
783	FYI, for your files.
783	Kim.
784	Yes, this would be fine.
784	Please stop by and mark your day(s) on the calendar that is pinned up on my wall.
784	Thanks, Kim.
785	Julie, it looks like a slip of the finger on Roger Hayes vs. Robert Hayes.
785	FYI, K. :>)
786	I checked with our Travel Agency and they cannot secure cheaper tickets than what we are seeing on the internet.
786	It looks like $1,100 - $1,200 is about the price for the Houston to Rome roundtrip.
786	FYI, Kim.
787	James, Would you please send Kevin Howard the email version of the economics for Trans Pecos and copy me.
787	Kevin is working with ArcLight as a potential equity investor for our portion of Trans Pecos.
787	Please let me know if you have additional questions.
787	Thanks, Kim.
788	I have no off duty time to report.
788	I've been here.
788	Thanks, Kim.
789	Kevin, Donna and I are working on the floor plan.
789	We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.
789	An assistant?
789	Davis Thames?
789	Please advise.
789	Thanks, Kim.
790	Steve, Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.
790	I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.
790	The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.
790	Do you want to see the real-time feeds?
790	It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.
790	Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.
790	Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).
790	Kim.
791	Thanks, we'll make room for the three of you.
791	We are looking at moving either to 39 or 44.
791	We have tentative floor plans for both.
791	When the floor decision has been made, we'll come to you for your consensus on the placement of your three slots.
791	We'll be back with you soon, I hope.
791	:>) Thanks, Kim.
792	FYI, please see Elizabeth's note below for purposes of checking the invoices tomorrow.
792	Thanks, Kim.
793	This looks good to me, but I defer to you for further comments.
793	Thanks, Kim.
794	Mark and Mark, We approve the costs to get real-time DTN feeds.
794	We would like to sign up for a 3 year agreement so that the $1,000 fee is waived.
794	We will have seven primary users right now: Harris, Steven Lindberg, Lorraine Lokay, Michelle McConnell, Mark Y'barbo, Paul Watson, Kimberly Thanks for all of your help on this.
794	Please let me know when real-time pricing can be installed.
794	Thanks, Kim.
795	Hi Jeff, John and I are also good to go for tonight.
795	We are open on flavors of food.
795	Some things that come to mind off the top of my head are: Raven Grill, Goode Company (Mexican or BBQ).....I'm trying to think of some place that we could have drinks, beer or wine....we are completely open.
795	Any thoughts on some place close to your neighborhood?
795	John and I were planning on meeting at the house to join up.
795	I'll bring the maps/books etc. Does 6:00pm sound OK?
795	Kim.
796	FYI , Kim.
797	OK.
797	BTW, when did you tell me your MGMA meeting was in Sept. Is this when we will go to Utah?
797	What city will we fly in and out of?
797	Kim.
798	Bullets, please.
799	thanks for the heads up.
799	Please mention in Steve's staff meeting on Monday.
800	All of these sound great.
800	Why don't you pick one.
800	We like all of these places.
800	Kim.
800	[Watson, Kimberly]
801	Audrey, Here they are.
801	Thanks, Kim.
802	Michelle, Would you please write up a full description of what the scope of our plans are with PG&E.
802	This description will be useful to Kevin Howard as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.
802	Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to Kevin.
802	Thanks, Kim.
803	Kevin, We will write these up and send them to you ASAP.
803	Thanks, Kim.
804	Tiny, Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.
804	Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?
804	If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.
804	My apologies, Kim.
805	Bod, Please add Jan Moore to your distribution list.
805	Thanks, Kim.
806	Jan, FYI, Kim.
807	Richard, Please make sure that Paul see's the invoice.
807	After Paul approves it, I can sign it too.
807	Thanks, Kim.
808	Don't forget we have lunch scheduled tomorrow, Tuesday, February 5.
808	Let's meet downstairs at 11:30am.
808	Any preference on flavors of food?
808	Kim.
809	opps, sorry.
809	I looked through the list too fast.
809	Thanks, Kim.
810	Steve, FYI, I just talked with Jo and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term.
810	She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us.
810	She (and probably Vernon) will get back to us.
810	I'll keep you posted on our conversations.
810	Kim.
811	James, thanks!
811	Kim.
812	Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar.
812	We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1.
812	The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week.
812	I will let you know when it is officially signed.
812	If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like .
812	Please let me know if you need additional information.
812	Thanks, Kim.
813	FYI, Kim.
814	Hi Jeff, Yes, this interconnect will be managed by our E&C group.
814	Earl Chanley will be the project coordinator.
814	Thanks for your quick reply.
814	Kim.
815	Earl, We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).
815	As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.
815	Our in-service date is May 1.
815	If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.
815	Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.
815	Thanks, Kim.
816	Are you back in the office yet?
816	We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/Houston.
816	Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket.
816	Paul and Judy are on board.
816	Can you and Tom join us?
816	Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell's broken leg.
816	Please call me, let's discuss.
816	Thanks, Kim X33098
817	John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.
817	I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!
817	Kim.
818	Yes, thanks.
818	I was aware.
818	I just couldn't remember if it was you or Terry.
818	Thanks, Kim.
819	Jan, These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.
819	Are you comfortable with the difference?
819	Any thoughts?
819	No hurry, I was just wondering.
819	Thanks, Kim.
820	Kyle, Sorry for not sending this yesterday.
820	Monday's are always tough.
820	Please review and let me know what you think.
820	Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.
820	Thanks, Kim.
821	Let's discuss.
821	Kim.
822	Lorraine, Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.
822	Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.
822	Thanks, Kim.
823	Bullets, please.
824	Thanks, Kim.
825	Audrey, Would you please email me the final bullets from last week.
825	I don't necessarily go look for the final copy since I am the one who combines all the bullets.
825	Thanks, Kim.
826	Lindy, Could you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?
826	Tiny is trying to complete his files.
826	Thanks, Kim.
827	Audrey, Here they are.
827	Thanks, Kim.
828	Audrey, As a matter of practice, would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves?
828	I will then save it in my word file and use it to start the next weeks bullets.
828	Thanks, Kim.
828	:>)
829	Jodi and Gaylen, Please see the list below.
829	Would you please look at what timeframe you could get the equipment listed below.
829	Our preliminary investigation suggests that we may not be able to obtain the equipment quick enough to meet a May in-service date.
829	If your engineering department has any questions about this list, please feel free to have them call Earl Chanley at the number below.
829	And, of course, if you have any questions of me, please feel free to call me at (713) 853-3098.
829	Thanks, Kim.
830	Bill, Please check out the changes in blue.
830	The changes in red are from Questar.
830	Thanks, Kim.
831	Lynn, I would like for you to review a draft of the proposed TW/Questar OBA in the Blanco Hub (the Interconnect Agreement is in the process of being signed and it is not built yet).
831	Sorry about all the "red-lines", but I think it makes it easier to see where we have made all of our changes.
831	FYI, the red changes are changes proposed by Questar, the blue changes are proposed by TW.
831	Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this agreement.
831	Thanks, Kim.
832	I did receive the signed I/C Agreement from Questar late on Friday.
832	I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature.
832	If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date, I would definitely recommend it.
832	Would you please provide me your thoughts.
832	Thanks, Kim.
833	Richard, We are proceeding ahead with a new I/C with Questar up in the Blanco Hub, here is the proposed OBA that we have been working on.
833	Please review and let me know if you have any concerns.
833	Thanks, Kim.
834	Earl, Thanks for the note.
834	Mansoor and I have talked and we would definitely like you to put a hold on this meter.
834	I will keep you posted on Questar's response to the list of equipment that you provided us last week as to how quickly they could receive any of this equipemnt.
834	Thanks, Kim.
835	Jennifer, I will be on vacation for this meeting.
835	Thanks, Kim.
836	Jodi, Here is another draft of the OBA.
836	Please review the changes I made with Gaylen and let me know your thoughts.
836	By the way, I did receive your signed I/C agreements on Friday afternoon.
836	We are routing internally for signature.
836	Thanks, Kim.
837	Linda, you are so welcome!
837	I leave for vacation Wed., but when I get back, I'll call you.
837	I want to see your new digs!
837	Have a great week!
837	Thanks, Kim.
838	Richard, I will be out of the office on vacation beginning Wed, Feb 13 and returning Monday, February 25.
838	Please include all the TW dealmakers on any updates that you may have on invoices.
838	Thanks, Kim.
839	Lindy, Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.
839	Let's discuss in the morning.
839	Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.
839	Thanks, Kim.
840	Gary, Henry did fax me some of the literature, but the quality of the fax is such that it is hard to read.
840	I am meeting with Jack tomorrow at 10:30, how about I stop by and see you.
840	Thanks, Kim.
841	Paul, FYI, Kim.
842	Lorraine and Paul, Please coordinate with each other and provide Steve an update by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) as to where your conversations stand with your customers on flipping these deals from Index to fixed rates.
842	He has a meeting with Stan at 2:00pm and will be asked about these I'm sure.
842	Also, Paul, would you please provide Steve any additional thoughts ( like we discussed yesterday) with respect to how and what things are included in our VaR.
842	Many thanks, Kim.
843	FYI, Kim.
844	reg affairs can provide you a copy.
844	Thanks, Kim.
845	Kevin, here is the info on the PG&E project.
845	Thanks, Kim.
846	Hi Jodi, I'm back in the office now.
846	I tried to open this document, but I do not have word perfect.
846	Can you convert to a Word document and resend for my files?
846	Many thanks, Kim
847	Jan, I believe that I do not have any memberships that fall into this category.
847	I'm thinking that Steve is the only one with possible memberships here.
847	Thanks, Kim.
848	I like it.
848	Kim.
849	Alma, I would like to attend the March 21 at 1:30 demo.
849	Where?
849	Thanks, Kim.
850	Elizabeth, Yes I would like to discuss this with you.
850	My schedule for Wednesday afternoon or Thursday looks good.
850	How about you?
850	Kim.
851	Hi Robert, Yes, I am still here!
851	However, the Research and Development department is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been returned to you.
851	Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted.
851	Kim.
852	Hi Jo, Yes, I do have time on Wednesday afternoon and would like to meet with you.
852	Might you be available anytime after 2:00pm?
852	Thanks, Kim.
853	Great, I'll see you at 2:00.
853	I am coming back in town on Wed, so if I can get back to the office by 1:30, do you want me to call you to come over early?
853	Thanks, Kim.
854	I didn't know you were going to Florida in July.
854	I will look at my schedule.
854	Do we know anyone in Miami?
854	ILY, K.
855	Steve, FYI, Kim.
856	Steve, here is the electronic version of the NNG proposal.
856	Kim.
857	Here is the proposal from NNG on south end transportation.
857	Any thoughts....particularity on the one year proposal of $0.065 plus commodity and fuel?
857	What do you think capacity release would cost for a one year term?
857	Thanks, Kim.
858	I think that would be great, however, I would like to discuss with Steve for approval on the expense.
858	Thanks, Kim.
859	I think I gave my time to you before I left, but if not, here it is...
859	Discretionary Day: February 19 Let me know if you have any questions.
859	Thanks, Kim :>)
860	Thanks Alma!
860	I would like for everyone in the TW marketing group attend this training.
860	Has everyone responded to you with a date to attend?
860	Kim.
861	Whose master firm physical gas agreement?
861	Does UBS have these?
861	Kim.
862	How about today (Thursday) at 2:00.
862	Can you come to EB1336?.
862	John, are you available, also?
862	Thanks, Kim.
863	I have a conference call then.
863	How about Friday morning or afternoon?
864	Friday at 9:00am works for me.
864	Where?
864	Kim.
865	Bullets, please!
866	Audrey, Does this impact us?
866	Kim.
867	Steve, What was the Oneok issue?
867	What does Ann mean by "ETS was releasing gas to Oneok"?
868	I must be sleepy this morning.
868	??.
868	K.
869	Audrey, Here they are.
869	Thanks, Kim.
870	John, Look at this.
870	Kim.
871	Lindy, this looks good.
871	I like it.
871	Thanks, Kim.
872	This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time!
872	You should have heard me scream!
872	I laughed so hard I had to hang up on the Steve Cooper voice mail.
873	Mansoor, this is the other thing I was trying to remember when I was in your office this afternoon.
873	I would like to discuss this with you.
873	Thanks, Kim.
874	Thanks, this was exactly what I was looking for.
874	Kim.
875	Yes, however, I thought I saw an earlier message from you booking this meeting at 9:00.
875	Either time works for me.
875	Please confirm.
875	Thanks, Kim.
876	FYI, Kim.
877	John, sorry, I forgot to respond, they look fine.
877	Thanks, Kim.
878	Randy, Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning.
878	We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station.
878	Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them.
878	We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings.
878	How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?
878	Thanks, Kim.
879	Steve, Are you available on Wednesday to discuss the Ivanhoe station?
879	We want to describe to you what the situation is and get your advice on what our regulatory options are.
879	I'm available anytime except 9:00-10:00 and 2:00-3:00.
879	Mansoor, how about you?
879	Thanks, Kim.
880	did you get an updated tariff from Reg Affairs?
880	Let me know if you still need assistance.
880	Thanks, Kim.
881	Audrey, My changes are in color.
881	Also, I will bring over to you a list of others to add.
881	(I could not add rows to this spreadsheet, sorry).
881	Thanks, Kim.
882	Hi Kirk, I just wanted to check in with you and see how you were doing.
882	How is the Big Sandy Project?
882	How are you doing on the water rights?
882	I hope all is well.
882	We're doing fine in Transwestern.
882	Kim.
883	It's official!
883	We are moving next week on Thursday, March, 14!
883	Actually, we have to be packed up by close of business on Wednesday, March 13.
883	Ruthann will be calling each of you to discuss your move needs, such as your type of computer equipment, whether or not you are moving your chair, etc...Boxes will be coming soon.
883	Please let Audrey or me know if you have any questions.
883	Thanks, Kim.
884	How about I talk with her on the phone...
884	We can visit with her tonight.
884	K.
885	FYI, Kim.
886	Gaylen and Jodi, Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet.
886	Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending.
886	I've got a draft that I will update for the spending.
886	I'll send it to you soon.
886	By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?
886	I am scheduled for the second session.
886	Thanks, Kim.
887	We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.
887	The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.
887	They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.
887	I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.
887	I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.
887	I'll keep you posted.
887	I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.
887	If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?
887	I have not checked into other Rome hotels.
887	Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.
887	Please advise.
887	Thanks, Kim.
888	Oh, My Italian Amigos, I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.
888	Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.
888	The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.
888	We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.
888	John, do you have a preference?
888	Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is.
888	Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.
888	Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.
888	Thanks, Kim.
888	P.S.
888	Paul, you'll have to give me your credit card information.
888	Call me with this info, do not send email.
888	(Due to Big E issues, I cannot delete any email messages and I don't want this info hanging around.)
889	Stuart, Your ears, or maybe mine, must have been burning lately.
889	I have been thinking about you over the past couple of days and wanted to call you and schedule lunch.
889	Is your new office in the Greenway Plaza area?
889	Gosh, we have lots to catch up on from both your side and mine.
889	Congratulations!
889	I know you must be excited and I can't wait to hear about your new opportunities with WHES!
889	What is you schedule the week of March 18?
889	Are you available for lunch anytime the week of 3/18?
889	Thanks, Kim.
890	Katy, Thanks for the list, however, I do not have word perferct and cannot open the document.
890	Can you convert it to a Word document and re-send?
890	Sorry for the trouble.
890	Thanks, Kim.
890	:>)
891	Ben and Dennis, We do indeed appreciate being able to use the 3907 conference room for our morning meetings.
891	Thank you for moving your standing Wednesday staff meetings to another meeting room.
891	We look forward to being on the same floor with everyone!
891	See you Thursday on EB39!
891	Kim.
891	:>)
892	My Italian Amigos, I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.
892	They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.
892	They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).
892	The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.
892	I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.
892	This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).
892	They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.
892	Is this hotel still OK?
892	I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.
892	Please let me know what your preference is.
892	I can clarify in my next fax.
892	If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?
892	Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.
892	I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.
892	Please advise.
892	Thanks, Kim.
892	P.S.
892	We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!
893	Please send me your bullets ASAP this morning.
893	If you have no bullets to report, please reply to me that you have none.
893	Thanks, Kim.
894	Audrey, here they are!
895	Steve, I just ran into Tracy in the hall and she asked if on Trans Pecos the $131MM (or it could be $138MM) represented 100% or 50% of the cost.
895	The $131 is 100% of the cost of the project.
895	If we joint venture with KMI, our cost would be half of this.
895	Call me if you have questions.
895	Thanks, Kim.
896	I will be out of town next Friday.
896	Lorraine will be attending for our group.
896	Thank you for the invite.
896	Kim.
897	Ruth, would you please invite Lindy Donoho also.
897	Thanks, Kim.
898	yes.
899	Yes, I called Steve Harris from the airport.
899	What is the amount?
899	I was not sure from the numbers below.
899	Please save the detail from my expense account.
899	Thanks, Kim.
900	Lindy, We are meeting on Tues at 10:00 in 1336 to discuss how TW may handle a storage point on our system with respect to how we contract for this point (given that contracts will want to receive and deliver to this point on a firm basis) as well as how we schedule gas at this point.
900	Will you be able to attend and give us your advise?
900	Many thanks, Kim.
901	We are sending them over this morning.
901	I have already talked to Dave Matney and told him the agreements were coming this morning.
901	They will review and we will plan to meet next Mon or Tues to iron out any remaining items (such as the operatorship) so we can tender to Pemex.
901	Stan is OK with them and has agreed that if we need to conceded the operatorship, we can, but he would like an opener in three years to re-bid the operatorship.
902	Steve, FYI, Kim.
903	Earl and Mansoor, I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.
903	Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.
903	Please confirm that you have what you need.
903	I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed.
903	Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.
903	Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.
903	I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.
903	Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?
903	Does anyone else need to see it?
903	Please advise.
903	Thanks, Kim.
904	Dennis, I am travelling Wednesday and will not be able to attend.
904	I am asking Lorraine to attend in my place.
904	Thanks, Kim.
904	Lorraine, Will you be able to attend this meeting?
904	Thanks, Kim.
905	Audrey, I have no off duty time to report.
905	Thanks, Kim.
906	Mark, let's discuss this and get with Kevin.
906	Thanks, Kim.
907	pretty cute.
908	Earl, Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?
908	Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?
908	FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week.
908	If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files.
908	Let me know if I need to talk to Agave.
908	Thanks, Kim.
909	Yes, I will fax it to you when I get home tonight.
909	In fact, when you get it, why don't you call me and we can talk about it.
909	This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school.
909	They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.
909	I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.
909	My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.
909	Thanks, Kim.

910	When you get back from vacation, let's talk about this.
910	What do I need to do?
910	Thanks, Kim.
911	I received a message that there will be a surprise lunch for Rich Jolly on Friday, March 29 from 11:30 to 1:00pm in ECN46C1.
911	Rich is retiring after 35 years of service.
911	Everyone is invited.
911	Thanks, Kim.
912	Tiny, I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.
912	I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.
912	Will you be attending?
912	Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.
912	Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?
912	When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.
912	I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.
912	Good luck on Bisti!
912	Thanks, Kim.
913	Tiny, Thanks for the note.
913	I'll let TK and Mark know that you got the money for the four wheeler.
913	Along with many, we will miss Rich a lot.
913	Thanks, Kim.
914	Cindy, This works fine for me.
914	Thanks, Kim.
915	Steve, I will plan to attend this meeting.
915	Kim.
916	FYI, Kim.
917	It may be a good idea for everyone to attend this meeting to get brought up to speed on the 637 filing.
917	See you there.
917	Kim.
918	Martha, I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.
918	Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).
918	Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.
918	He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.
918	His office number is 713 739-6715 (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).
918	His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).
918	Please give him a call.
918	He is very happy in his new role.
918	My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him.
918	Give me a shout when you get back into the office.
918	Thanks, Kim P.S.
918	We moved up to 39 last weekend.
918	I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.
918	Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.
918	(Sorry.......) Call me.
919	I was really thinking about the prep work needed for Sat evening.
919	Can we talk tonight?
919	What watering hole?
919	Where?
920	Dear Gary and Fran, Attached, please find a resignation letter from both me and Lorraine Lindberg.
920	If you would like a signed hard copy, just let me know, I would be happy to provide it to you.
920	Lorraine has also indicated that she would provide you a signed hard copy, too.
920	At your convience, I would like to visit with each of you.
920	Sincerely, Kim.
921	Steve, Tiny sent me this note when he heard the news.
922	This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.
922	It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).
922	Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.
922	Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth.
922	She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.
922	It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
922	Good Luck!
922	Kim.
923	Sherry, Thank you so much for your kind thoughts.
923	I sure have enjoyed working with everyone.
923	I will miss all the great personalities that we have assembled in ETS!
923	And, you can definitely count on me for being at The Nutcracker!
923	Thanks again, Kim :>)
924	Audrey, here they are.
924	Thanks, Kim.
925	Shelley, Congratulations!
925	TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone.
925	Can we schedule lunch next week?
925	I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition.
925	I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
925	Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.
925	Thanks, Kim.
926	Great.
926	I'll put 11:30 on my calendar.
926	Kim.
927	Audrey, Please reflect this change for John Cogan on the customer/phone/email list.Thanks, Kim.

929	Actually, today is my last day in the office.

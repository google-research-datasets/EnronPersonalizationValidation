94	This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position instead of a February Index position.
94	I am currently working on the problem and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.
94	John is aware of the situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.
94	Thanks, Errol L. McLaughlin
95	Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for everyone.
95	They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.
95	Thanks -- I know it's a pain, Errol
96	Frank, After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.
96	Previously when interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically.
96	I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.
96	Thanks, Errol McLaughlin
97	Jeff, For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.
97	The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.
97	In addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.
97	John would let them change those deals too.
97	On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps.
97	Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM.
97	When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, and he stated that what they click on is what they get.
97	I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset'.
97	They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.
97	We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.
97	We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.
97	Errol
98	Yes this is correct.
98	This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday.
98	EOL is only booking them to one leg.
98	Thanks, Errol
99	The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.
99	Thanks, Errol McLaughlin
100	Greg, Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.
100	Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.
100	Errol McLaughlin
101	Done.
102	Sharon, How do I call you?
102	Each time I call you back, the phone goes to cover and there is no message, so I can't leave you a message.
102	Thanks, Errol
103	Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're pregnant!

150	Bob, I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and options.
150	In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be the most incorrectly valued.
150	In order to get the valuations, I had book administators run calculations in the ERMS system.
150	These values should correlate with how credit valued these deals.
150	The file consists of a summary worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.
150	Please feel free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.

213	Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.
213	This was an EOL deal that Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.
213	Deal QF9221.1 was booked in Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.
213	Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 was not killed when we booked the new deal.
213	Please call me with any questions.
213	Thanks, Errol, X5-8274
214	It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly.
214	Instead of deal QF9221.1 netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.
214	I have killed deal NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.

225	Irena, The team provides us with great service currently.
225	The only area of improvement I can think of regards new-hires.
225	I need to give you and your team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.
225	If we could come up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that would help.
225	I know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.
225	Hopefully, we won't have as many space issues in the future.
225	I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.
225	I will work hard to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.
225	Thanks, Errol
226	Jeremy, John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system.
226	We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, but tonight we see that we don't.
226	John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well.

234	Sue, I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today.
234	I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.
234	All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.
234	I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group.
234	If the same problem arises tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report.

245	Frank, I'm sorry, but disregard the first message I sent.

245	This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.
245	I'm still working to find a deal like your requested.
245	I'll let you know.

281	Thanks, Errol
282	Jeff, I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.
282	When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?
282	My guys (and myself for that matter) have seen and heard of people moving into the program and I am getting a lot of questions on the matter.
282	Thanks, Errol

298	I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co. I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.
298	No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.
298	Let me know how I can help.
298	Errol
299	Done.

316	John, After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.
316	This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.
316	A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.
316	Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.
316	I apologize for the error.
316	We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.
316	Thanks, Errol
317	I will be there.
318	Heather, Can you do me a favor.
318	The Reward Bucks application I filled out, was for Michelle Nelson.
318	I will be out all of next week.
318	If you get it next week can you have it sent to her.
318	She sits behind me at 3249B.
318	Her extension is X5-8091.
318	Thanks, Errol, X5-8274

322	John, Are the 24 hr gas stacks going to be running on Thanksgiving and the Friday after (11/22, 11/23)?.
322	EOL is asking.
322	Thanks, Errol
323	hilarious
324	I am sorry.
324	I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.
324	That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.
324	I feel awful now.
324	I thought it would be fun.
324	We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.
324	Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.
324	We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.
324	We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.
324	Your resume looks good.
324	You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.
324	This is especially true when you first start.
324	This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.
324	We can talk more later.
324	Thanks, Errol
325	Francis, Could you do this again for me please.

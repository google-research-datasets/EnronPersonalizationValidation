0	Let's try this time on for size!
1	I would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct reports with about 10% of my pool reserved for my use.
1	Can you help me with this?
1	I also understand that we are doing a handoff from Ben to Shanna for my support point, therefore I am sending this to both of you.
1	For Ben: Where are we on the job description I sent
2	Do you have the same for the income side?
3	FYI.
3	This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the financials.
3	This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we could see had value.
3	I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the "Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common Design".
3	I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my position on this issue.
4	I haven't heard back from Rebecca on this, but I'm sure she is busy.
4	Do either of you care to answer my question below.
5	I didn't forget.
6	Do you still have the instructions for the wire to Compass Bank in the files?
6	I would like it wired there.
7	Here is the info: Bank: Compass Bank For credit to the account of Roderick J. and Kathleen R. Hayslett Thanks.
7	I would like this done as soon as possible as I will be needing the funds at the end of the week.
7	Rod Hayslett
8	Consulting Group that may be able to help with SAP stuff.
9	We will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total.
9	A way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits received.
9	That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same deal.
9	If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.
9	Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.
9	1) The project economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach).
9	The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more important measure of success.
10	In order for me to effectively represent you at the ETS PRC and for some of you at the Accounting and Finance PRC's I will need some information from each of you.
10	Please send the following to Kathy Campos who will put it together for me in a book.
10	1.
10	Copy of your goals for 2000 and the latest status.
10	2.
10	A list of accomplishments/things you are proud of this year, specifically indicate any involvement in the Associates/Analysts Program or the Recruiting Program.
10	3.
10	Copy of a Self Evaluation you completed in the PEP System.
10	4.
10	Your Supervisor will provide me with a Copy of a Preliminary Evaluation.
10	I will need these by the 29th of November for those in the accounting and finance ranks.
10	For all others I will need the input for the 13th of December.
11	FYI
12	All OK>
13	Please provide whatever assistance you can in getting info to Tracy to respond to the attached request.
14	A reminder of what was in the Enron goal presentation and what we did last year.
15	FYI
16	Please approve and forward for payment.
16	Thanks.
17	I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.
17	I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project.
18	I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.
18	We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem.
19	I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch.
20	FYI
21	This is a work in Progress.
22	Forgot the attachment.
22	Here it is.
23	Hi Felicia, I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.
23	Thanks, Rod
24	What is the deal?
25	We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.
25	If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.
25	It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.
25	The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.
25	From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.
25	Tracy has the point on this one.
25	Jim Saunders: What do you know about the other comments?
26	FYI.
26	You got it!
27	Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.
27	I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office.
28	Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start.
29	I'm fine.
30	I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so.
31	Brasher Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.
31	A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.
31	What are your thoughts?
32	FYI
33	The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.
33	Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.
33	Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.
34	Any idea on when I can get your info?
35	For Kathy: How many have been submitted?
36	FYI.
36	This was the detail provided to Sarabeth.
37	FYI.
37	Brasher Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory Morris Brassfield
38	What were the individual participation rates by entity?
39	This is an FYI, but I think that Insurance probably fits into Jerry's world.
40	I can't make it.
40	I have another PRC to do.
41	Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?
42	I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance.
43	FYI
44	Approved.
45	Approved.
46	We won't have a permanent place until sometime after the end of December.
47	Service agreements and construction jobs, as well as capital expenditure, obligate Enron and as a result the rules for RAC approval for commitments apply.
47	Please get Denis or James involved on all appropriate deals.
47	Thanks.
47	Rod
48	FYI
49	It is not necessary.
49	Other than Tracy, he would be the only one of the accounting and finance people there and Stan is trying to limit the attendance to the group necessary for the discussions.
50	I have been in discussions with them as well, and I don't think they have that flexibility.
50	Who has actually been working on the move for you?
50	I will have Pam Daily from my Admin Team contact you for specifics.
51	Cash?
52	First of all, why can't we do a deal with Northern Plain's, a wholly owned subsidiary?
53	Sally: Where do I go inside Enron to get straight what it is that I need to do in order to be able to use the curves I am told that we need to be using?
53	Rod Hayslett
54	I understand now.
54	Thanks.
55	What's the first day you have free for lunch?
56	Yes, my mistake.
57	I missed you again.
57	Sorry.
57	Its for the am, can you make it?
58	That would work well if I was trying to do projects, but I am trying to be able to utilize the curves in the business to measure VaR.
58	We now use them for NNG & TW in the Caminus System, and want to do so for our other pipes as well.
59	Thanks.
60	I am in agreement with Tod on #1.
60	It's your call, but you should make the call on whether or not we will integrate it into Enron.
60	If we do, then we will get Adam the help he needs, but it will be more efficient than providing stand alone support.
61	What is/was this meeting about?
62	Too bad I can't be there.
62	I have a staff meeting to run.
63	Not before you scheduled the meeting.
63	Only as a result of it.
64	I would like Morris Brassfield and Carolyn Centilli to play this role.
65	Are you aware of where this is coming from?
66	Do you have a candidate?
66	I would argue that we are looking at a process review, so anyone who can do a process review could do this.
67	Do you have a document signed by Stan authorizing the amount of dollars you need to spend?
68	Ok, but make sure the documentation of the email follows the invoice for the payment, otherwise we will have to go back to him to appriove the payment.
68	On the otherhand, there is no reason that a DASH can't be used for non-discretionary approvals as well, and if it doesn't have to go to RAC, then it doesn't.
69	I think we should have this discussion at Stan's staff meetings next monday.
70	Thanks.
70	The date will probably have to move since the most recent events have some of us kind of hopping.
70	I understand that you have raised your forecast of the 4th qtr, significantly.
70	That's great.
70	Looking forward to the simple explanation.
71	When: Thursday, October 25, 2001 10:00 AM-11:00 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
71	Where: here
72	What is driving the return of the cash?
73	If we do this, we need to have both an internal group and an external group.
74	Mary Kay, Ray and Rob: Can you 3 help her out on 1 & 2?
74	Tracy: Please handle 3.
75	FYI
76	We have done it before, in fact it was the way all of the pipes were originally built, but not for short term stuff.
76	Gavin Russo can probably help us with his property tax background.
76	Lou, please try to get hold of Gavin or whomever he believes should take part in the discussion.
77	I am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the Phase 5 financing locked down.
77	I would expect that we could have it in another month, unless I run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there, and I'll let you know as soon as I do.
78	These would be in the debt tests performed for the lenders.
78	Do you know the answers?
79	I am assuming that by now you know that I am pledging my receivables into the secured deal Dan Boyle is working on.
80	Does this cost center get allocated or direct charged?
80	Please get back to Morris for me.
81	FYI
82	I think Kathy has a new one out for the 7th.
83	In the covenants of the debt agreements.
83	If it's not a test in the lenders package, then it is not in the deal.
84	Need to get you 2 talking to LORI, I don't see much of a problem in going along with the EOTT valuation.
84	It's their asset now.
85	Please fix.
86	Great start.
87	The first problem is finding the time and money to do something and given everything else that is going on, right now is not the best time to be spending some money.
87	To get the outside contractor taken care of we would have to let GSS find us a party to do the work, so you might want to be thinking of other parties who might be qualified to do the work.
88	I guess I need some more definition.
88	If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.
88	Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan?
88	I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.
88	Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.
88	I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.
88	Especially at the top.
89	What is this about?
90	FYI
91	Peters and Saunders should probably be in attendance, but not required.
92	I will be attending.
93	This is a test for the blackberry.
93	Rod Hayslett
94	Rod Hayslett
95	Thanks!
95	Rod Hayslett
96	We will need a Unanimous Consent to make Kevin an Officer of the pipes, title should just be Vice President.
96	I think given the discussions over the weekend it would be good to do so effective last friday.
96	Thanks.
96	Rod Hayslett
97	I have a DSL connection and sometimes it takes as long as 3-4 minutes to load the page.
97	Is there anything that can be done to improve the speed?
97	Rod Hayslett
98	Thanks.
99	What is the purpose of this meeting?
100	Are we still waitning on some info here?
101	If I could get something as simple as Lost Time, vehicle accidents, or such I would appreciate it.
102	I have asked Corporate where it will be reported in the 4th qtr, if it's not going to be reported as wholesale then there is no real reason to bother Wes.
103	What is the purpose of this meeting?
103	I may not be able to make it.
104	FYI Rod Hayslett
105	Don't count on me.
106	Where do you intend to have that meeting?
107	I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.
107	Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?
107	The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Corp on.
107	I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.
107	We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.
107	His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.
107	Rod Hayslett
108	Its fine
109	Moved to the 7th.
110	I will keep it on the calendar but cannot promise anything at this point in time.
111	Will Keith Marlowe be in attendance?
112	Not as far as I know.
113	Don't know.
114	FYI
115	Looks like there may have been a little confusion here, but it appears that the deal is still working as before.
116	Not at this time.
116	I think as long as Enron is performing, I'm not sure why there is all of this noise.
117	I have already approved and forwarded.
118	Yes and yes, but it will take me another day or so for the announcement
119	I think the biggest problem is that where are we going to get the funds for that?
120	FYI
121	Let's forward to the ETS Officer's for review/comments to be discussed monday am.
122	I think the real problem right now is that until the current crisis is over we need to reduce all calls for cash of any type to only those necessary to make cash today.
123	And we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal, if that is deemed to be necessary.
123	It will be worth the paper it is written on at the moment it is written, but means nothing 1 second later, and that's the problem with these kind of things.
123	I guess my concern is what good will it do anyone?
123	I don't think it's a problem to get, however I do believe we would want to get V&E's opinion at the time we wanted it, that it was necessary/required.
124	Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.
124	What do you think?
125	Agreed.
125	By the way we are very close to a deal and therefore a press release shortly thereafter.
126	Can you please get with Roger and make sure we understand what needs to be done?
127	I am trying to get a decision, but I think we need to maintain flexibility, if at all possible.
128	Still want to try and get it done this year.
128	Per Stan this am.
128	Cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash.
128	If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.
129	FYI.
130	I have forwarded to kelly
131	I will handle this afternoon
132	Understood
133	tHANKS.
134	What can we do about getting this done?
135	FYI
136	I am not sure, I just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of.
137	Can someone send us a synopsis of the changes in the plan and what the expected impact on NP and NBP services comapny is?
138	Do you have a history with Hughes?
139	Understood, that's what I thought this was.
140	FYI
141	FYI
142	How do we get this loop closed?
142	Is this a meeting?
143	Let Warren and Tom know that this is a critical.
144	I would be happy to do so.
144	Do you have a preference, or Lawrence do you have a preference as to how this is handled?
144	Should someone from the pipes be in the bank meeting, for moral support, if not for the steel.
145	Do you have his number?
146	Was there a plan here, like you guys decided to not pay, or was this just overlooked?
147	FYI
148	Are these any of our floors?
149	Explain what you are looking for?
150	Agreed.
151	Make sure they are current.
152	FYI
153	As you can see we are working to get our floors covered.
154	Sally: Can you help me figure out who I need to talk to to get the deals we did with you as ECT back in 1999, modified?
155	Here is my shot at it.
156	Jim should call with aphone number so that I don't ave to over there Please send me an email to let me know
157	Thanks
158	Hole is unlikely, but is a real weak point in any sales discussion.
159	Please forward to kevin howard.
160	Call Luitgard Fischer
161	Cancel me out of lunch and any other meetings tomorrow.
161	Rod Hayslett
162	Agree
163	FYI
164	Can you give me a quick definition of the frequency rates (formula please)?
165	Thanks.
166	I'm here
167	I agree.
167	Let's go.
168	Who will sign theses?
169	I agree with Jim.
169	FERC has not issued an order yet.
170	I am just now leaving the office, I hope.
170	Rod Hayslett
171	To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c Drew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request?
172	I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.
172	It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.
172	Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.
172	We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended.
173	Has Cheryl seen the stuff?
173	Need to get her and Jerry on board as well.
174	Just catch Cheryl up then on the changes.
175	That works for me.
175	I will attempt to answer some of Heather's questions as well.
176	Reclass both please
177	What do you think?
178	Yes
179	You might say that we are lending the Money to Enron and therefore are now looking further than nng and tw
180	Just send the package to kevin, we just need backup, not pesentations
181	Unless you can think of a reason why not it makes it simpler, I think.
182	Where are you?
183	Can you help?
184	I think that is the right answer
185	I will not make the cio mtg at 1
186	I am un available for the 1 pm meeting.
186	I like Nick and Everett
187	Please send to gary smith
188	Bring whole thing if this is the notee agreement with ENE
189	I am in 50M if you need me.
190	Still tied up
191	When do we review with el paso?
192	Need before board meeting
193	No
194	All three.
195	Can you guys take care of this part?
196	Do you want me to attend the meeting at 11:00 in 32C2?
196	Rod Hayslett
197	On the other deal, they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars.
197	I will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for Mitch tomorrow.
198	There is no fair value.
199	There is fair value, and you can figure it out by comparing the Form 2 with the GAAP financials.
200	See comment below.
201	I will attend.
202	That was the discussion late last night
203	Robert Guthrie
204	Can you help me out here?
204	I don't know what the purpose of the language is but I think from a purist point of view that it is accurate.
205	FYI
206	Drew is correct, but we can tell them where we want the money wired.
207	If you want us to pursue getting this cash directly to ENE we will be happy to try.
208	None that I am aware.
209	we will get it handled.
209	CAn you send out the notice that the dates are changing and we will have to reschedule before you leave?
210	I am up with STAN if you need me.
211	You're right.
212	If it keeps going the way it is now there is a possibility.
213	All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.
213	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.
213	This is a directive I have just received from Stan.
213	Rod Hayslett
214	What was the original question?
215	This message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow.
215	Your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time.
216	OK
217	Got me to thinking, how are you guys doing?
217	Where are you in the cash management world?
217	I know you were tight before, is the situation any better?
218	I nee to go to stans office apologize to steve dowd for me
219	On my way down
220	Please handle
221	THe enron situation has slowed down the process as we have not been able to get a clean OK from the SEC to go forward as yet.
222	I will work with her and Dan to try and figure out a better solution in the short term.
222	Now that some space is available from the moves to the new building, it is possible that there is a better place to move to for a period of time.
223	CAll Stan when you get in probably closer to 7 our time.
224	Comments below.
225	Sounds like they have a deal already.
226	What do you think we should focus on for the crew?
226	Attached is a data sheet that I would like to keep up as things change.
226	Rod Hayslett
227	Was it an actual downgrade or just that they wouldn't agree not to do so?
228	Basically yes
229	Will get back to you.
230	FYI
231	The $550 of debt that is in the calcualtion assumes we borrow the 550 next week.
231	Otherwise there is only 17 or so there.
232	FYI
233	I apologize for the confusion but the interviews are being cancelled at this time.
233	Thank you for your patience and assistance in getting us ready to go.
234	Do you have (or bob) copies of nng's debt agreements, current?
235	Please do.
235	I'm in 49c1.
235	I think there are 3 deals
236	Not currently under consideration, in fact would be a problem
237	Tracy and jim are trying to track down 6 more copies.
237	Could you see where this stands?
237	We are in 49c1
238	Don't know
239	5ravis is in charge.
240	Can you bring these to 49c1?
241	Not yet
242	Please call.
242	36178
243	Thanks.
244	May as well cancel.
245	Only Kevin and his assistant, no one else.
246	FYI
247	FYI
248	Which company?
249	Where do you stand on this stuff now?
249	For everyone, if we are going to get this done, we need things taken care of.
249	If there is a problem you need to let us know ASAP!
250	Rod Hayslett
251	What gives?
252	OK
253	Would you 2 think about those who helped us so we can attempt to get some award to those who really helped us out here.
254	I had specifically taken this deal to Jeff for approval, and he had decided to not go forward at that point in time.
254	I would like to get a review with Stan and Jeff to decide.
254	Rod
255	Brokerage accounts.
255	Do you have copies of the agreements?
255	Both TW and NNG.
256	I would like contact info on you and your key players, just in case.
256	I don't think I will need much accounting help before monday.
256	Thanks Rod
257	FYI
258	I'm ok, deal is not quite announced.
258	Hope you are having a good time.
259	Do you have volumes and rates info to go with the NNG current estimate and the 2002 plan?
259	If not you, can you get for me?
260	Any news?
261	What's going on?
262	Thank you!
263	Have you talked to Somerholder?
264	Agreed!
265	We plan on reviewing with Stan on monday.
265	Previously he had left it up to Jeff who had said no to.
266	Kathy, I love you Rod
267	It,s an entity set up to handle nng's and TW's cash.
267	Through this account cash flows to corp.
267	Joel will handle this.
268	I have a request, AA has asked if we can repay the notes to the pipes,.
268	Not actually, but realistically from business unrelated to the pipes.
268	They may want to discuss with you.
269	Yes.
269	They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
269	They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.
269	They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.
270	The party at AA is Roger Willard 713 646 6360
271	The party at AA is Roger Willard 713 646 6360 if you feel up to trying to convince him.
271	Rod
272	Why is there a note showing NNG as a borrower from Enron?
273	We will keep trying
274	FYI
275	There is no need to get into a discussion with AA at this point.
276	any updates?
277	There are definitely issues here and we will have to deal with them for sure.
277	I will let you know when there is document to review so that we can get moving.
278	I have none
279	WE are following the issue and I believe INGAA is going to be filing somethiong that we have had input on.
280	FYI
281	Are you aware of any?
281	I'm not?
282	MAybe the language should be "redeem".
283	I would like to but we may have to put it off until next week.
283	I am currently working weird hours trying to get the $1B of debt closed and funded.
283	I will get back to you.
284	Approved.
285	Are moving our IT support into our world?
285	Will Nick need to replace him?
286	I am OK, as long as the budget dollars are available to do it.
287	We will propose to Stan and see where we are at that time.
287	If it was this week, the answer would probably be no.
288	I am only concerned about moving IT types into our world that were previously in Nick's world if the job responsibilities move with them.
288	Sounds like this is not the case, so I am OK.
289	Here it is, it is not yet in final form.
290	Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.
290	I am little touchy right now about how to approach people, so we need to be careful.
290	I am open to more discussion on this, just would like to soften the tone a litlle.
291	Let me talk to Stan when he gets back to town.
291	Lou and I need to discuss with him, and we are a little occupied with the credit agreement stuff.
292	FYI
293	What do you think of this?
294	Can you help us here?
294	For Mariella and Jeff: Has this divestiture been to RAC?
294	It will need to go, and probably sonner rather than later.
295	Lance Schuler will help us deal with board issues related to the merger.
296	We need your help ASAP.
297	I think it would be OK, but you might want to check with Stan.
298	I have.
299	OK
300	Does this really have to be done?
300	It's probably too late now, but we really do need to watch our spending for awhile.
300	I would like to coordinate moves through our move people either Ruth Ann Frausto (3AC) or Pam Daily (EB) so I can keep up with space as well as costs that are coming down the pike.
301	FYI
302	Are you still going to be making a presentation?
303	This staff meeting is monday at 9:30 in 3AC.
304	I don't know but I need you to call me (i'm at work) and check your email for one I just sent out.
305	Does this make us feel better?
306	I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.
306	I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.
306	Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.
306	This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.
307	I think I feel better, but I would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew.
308	Be on the look out.
309	Yes I did
310	Approved
311	We're there given his response.
312	Won't be able to make it.
312	Sorry.
313	Stan called back and explained.
313	We need to do 100% and begin to look at dollars that could be saved.
313	This is an estimating process to figure out if we can effectively reduce our spending and by how much and then what portion of that benefits Enron.
314	No, but thank you foroffering
315	If you need me I'm in the cafeteria for 5 minutes
316	Are you aware of this?
317	Is this a place that is big enough to handle some extras?
318	I was actually thinking only about the people in Morris's Brassfield's crew?
318	But he should now about already, as he supports Phil.
319	No, I'm working on the credit agreement.
320	Thanks.
321	Talk to Steve, but I think he is working on a reliability issue that probably needs to handled, but may be able to be done over a period instead of all at once.
321	I really don't know, but he will.
322	I believe so
323	It's an informal get together that shouldn't last more than about an hour.
323	I want to make sure you all have access to info and we can share concerns etc.
324	I think what the partnership values it does not have to have a relationship to what we value it at.
324	Jim?
325	Thanks.
325	Great job.
326	Do you have any critical people that you are afraid you will lose because of the merger?
326	How about a group?
326	Rod Hayslett
327	The meeting will at the most last a little more than an hour or 2.
327	Nothing special to prepare for.
328	No reason to be other at this point.
329	where did you get this?
330	FYI
331	I will approve the posting subject to the condition that it be internal only at this time.
332	I will submit that that may be the case today.
332	I am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 2 (regulatory) will require.
333	I'm about to return to the office to see it.
333	About 15minutes.
334	Listen to voice mail forwarded from Jim
335	This is fine.
336	How about sending it out from me.
337	Is the same true for the current estimate?
338	That is understood.
338	He will be taking Glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it.
338	I don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions.
338	There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data.
338	By the wya, Kevin needs to do the Marketing Affiliate stuff.
339	Aren't you being a little rough on her on a problem that really doesn't make any difference to Dynegy?
340	FYI
341	Per you request: Also make sure that Jeff Sommers added his name to his list.
341	There is a separate wind retention program.
341	I am not aware of the EEOS situation currently, Keith Marlow has been out of town.

342	If necessary I can go.
342	I will need to be in Houston on Wednesday am.
343	I'm on board.
344	No, because they are in networks.
345	FYI.
345	I understand Jim needs Tom Meers to review # 17
346	Are you OK?
347	I want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time.
347	If there is someone who is having a particular problem, now is a time to be comforting.
347	I also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending.
347	If you have a vacancy, now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now.
347	Rod Hayslett
348	As to P6, it is in the budget for next year, but we want to start this year.
348	Timing is never perfect.
349	Do we want to tighten these up somewhat?
350	Sounds reasonable to me.
351	Great Ideas.
352	Talk with Jim
353	CAn you 2 help her out here?
353	I believe the footnotes probably cover it, but to the extent you have more, it would be helpful.
354	I am at the lake.
354	936 597 3905
355	If you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again.
356	Are you sure I don't need to be there?
357	OK.
357	If I leave here I will call your cell so you know how to reach me.
358	Better than most recently.
359	That is one of the things we are working on.
359	At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if theyexercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.
359	The price they paid recognized the debt was there, if it is not there, the price will be higher.
359	Suffice it to say all of these things will be tken care of before it funds.
360	Yes.
360	When things get speculative the language always gets scary.
361	I am leaving the lake.
361	Use cell for next 40 minutes and then use home if you need me.
361	Remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home
362	Hi.
362	I'm sitting in the airport waiting on the plane.
362	Going to New York tonight and will be home tuesday night.
362	Hope you guys are doing fine.
362	Sure was good talking to you this am.
362	Love, Dad
363	Thanks.
364	Good morning.
364	I am staying at the W Hotel Room 1716 I have my cell phone and my !lackberry so I can get email.
364	I should be back in te office on wednesday.
364	Rod
365	Can you please review and get back to Tim?
366	Where do you want to meet to walk over there?
366	Do you want to eat lunch somewhere before?
367	I willnot be able to attend.
368	Where do you want to meet to go over there?
368	Is it far?
369	We're on the way.
370	Probably can handle monday pm.
370	Will get with you wednesday but feel free to schedule anything after 12:00.
371	Not yet.
371	There are still some remaining issues to be sorted out.
372	Got it.
373	No, at least not to my knowledge.
374	If you need asignature fax it to the hotel.
375	Do you know anything?
376	As you can see not everybody is always on board.
377	I intend to distribute something this week
378	Should be fine
379	Can you send me an invitation for the 2 meetings on monday in outlook?
379	I ca then accept and get it on my calendar in the office
380	The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.
380	A 13d filing is required.
380	If we want to sell then we need to file and wait.
381	I'm on my way back there to do so.
382	Love
383	Your welcome
384	I would think that if they pay in advance it should not be a problem,
385	Great job
386	What will happen to this project.
386	Alaska?
387	What is going on?
388	Anything exciting going on today?
388	We are proceeding witha great reception so far.
388	We did 4 meetings yesterday and have 4 more today and one more by phone tomorrow.
388	Going well here.
389	Yes I will be back tonight
390	Thanks.
390	What is the mood?
391	Things are ok.
391	Have a Happy Thansgiving
392	I'll try
393	Probably willbe working
394	Ok I'm fine
395	However you would have to agree that we have some level of control over the GP.
396	No, he is in fact commercial doing deals negotiating transactions of significant size, 2.5 B this year alone.
397	Go for the dollars
398	Ok I asked gary to have you decide on Michael.
398	I think he is utility player that can fil several roles, but if your tEam won't need help, I'm not sure if I need him.
399	I wasanswering Janet's comment
400	GP is general partner in NB
401	Any news
402	I agree.
402	I told Gary you could make the call.
403	I'm on plane.
403	If you need me to call tonight leave me an email or phpne mail and I will call when I get in.
404	Hi
405	FYI
406	did you get mine?
407	Let me, as well as others, know the outcome.
408	Since we are no longer using Maverix, that guarantee can be done away with.
408	Are the rest all really with Enron?
408	In the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded?
409	FYI
410	Outside of normal business lines is outside of the pipelines and therefore is not subject to being an issue here.
411	This would be an Enron deal.
411	And we just have to get over the hurdles here.
412	Before we can sell the units need to be registered.
413	FYI
414	Can you help us out here from what you know?
414	I do not believe you can loan money to Enron.
414	Have you filed to be able to make the special dividend?
415	Just forget about it, the company will not be reimbursing for attendance this year.
416	You need to begin thinking about what we could do here if we were asked to reduce staffing to save money?
417	I do not intend to approve reimbursement by the company for attendance.
418	If we have already signed up and can,t get the money back then spread the word that is ok
419	I agree with Morris
420	I agree with Morris.
420	Little value to the pipes
421	Not very good.
421	There will besome better news later today
422	Call Bob Butts
423	Is there any way to just reduce the expenses for now
424	Can you do the gallup contracts as well
425	Need to watch closely
426	I'm back
427	Let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place.
427	I need your home cell or whatever
428	FYI
429	Great job!
430	Yes for sure.
431	The same to you and yours.
432	I have forwarded to Stan and agree with your perspective.
432	Could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something?
433	Assume afudc as 100% debt at 6%
434	Do you have this data?
435	Thanks.
436	The data is actually aggregated and netted, the specific deal data is not provided.
436	The detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals.
436	See the bolded data below.
436	The example given basically says I am in a position of having more gas at Ventura in January 2002 than I have commitments to sell by 10 MMCF/d.
436	Did you understand that?
437	I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan.
437	I need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from CERA.
437	Rod
438	Approved.
439	Remember this is for the equity piece and thery are looking at it for the longer term.
440	This is very confidential at this point in time.
440	Do not forward.
440	Be prepared to discuss the job that each does and what we need to do to be able to transition early monday am if not before.
440	Call me.
440	This is what I am trying to reach you about.
440	The assumed time frame for this is next week.
440	My numbers are as follows: try this one first: 936-597-3905 or my cell: 713-201-6135 Happy Thanksgiving, Rod
441	FYI this is the list we are currently working on related to EEOS.
442	Probably a monday meeting of some of our marketing types to work on this one.
443	Red rock capacity is 107,000
444	Here is the message
445	I haven't heard back from Steve at all.
445	Do you have anumber for him?
446	We will be doing a confernce call tomorrow am @ 10:00 our time with JP Morgan 877-382-9541 passcode 473270 to answer some of the questions, especially the CERA questions.
447	We have the data
448	Ok with me.
449	Is Kathy here?
450	I will not be available
451	Tell her to get my expense report done
452	What happened to the guy with the paper to sign?
453	She just came
454	FYI
455	FYI
456	FYI
457	CAn you give me something that can be used to estimate the fuel available for sale?
458	Here is the basic info on the other projects discussed on the phone the other day.
459	Probably need Rob and Mary Kay by phone.
460	be right there.
461	Probably need to check with H R group providing services
462	What is the purpose of this?
463	What do you think about Tracy and Jim?
464	More TW info.
465	Info on generating plants in cal and southwest
466	FYI
467	I'm in Stan's office
468	What is in the plan?
469	Stan,s office
470	Capital for red rock between 2001 and 2002
471	Canyou get me detail then on the capital for the 2 years?
472	Do you still need me to sign something
473	What would you like me to do?
474	I think you got an old list and should have taken my name off.
475	Can you attend this one for me?
475	They are working on the sale of our interest in the Trailblazer Pipeline.
475	Sounds like a reasonable deal to me.
476	FYI
477	Probably.
477	Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar.
477	the margins for 2001 and 2002 are not the same and I didn't think we had 2001 in the other model in detail.
477	Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.
477	You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.
477	You have to remember it was an expansion, not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact.
478	What do you have to backup the 2001 and 2002 revenue projectoions for NNG?
479	They took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.
479	Michael: What do you know about this one?
480	I have asked Kevin to sit in on this one for me.
480	Trailblazer on wednesday am.
481	I am having trouble getting this to you.
481	So I am trying again.
481	Also do you have any inventory that could be sold that is not encumbered already.
481	Trying to think about what could be done to improve your cash in the short term.
482	I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.
482	The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.
482	The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.
482	Their receivables from California are part of the problem.
482	More update later.
483	Is the cost center in question allocated or direct charged?
483	The corporate Enron Corp Business Controls cost center.
484	You can use my office but I may not be here.
485	Why do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much?
485	We have to get a better handle on all of this and fast.
486	I could probably do by phone and may be here.
487	Either Robert Guthrie or greek Rice.
488	The deal with the Banks is being held up by Paribas to get a cross-netting agreement with Enron.
488	I understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today.
488	Bill Bradford is working on this one.
488	So it's up to Enron to fix the problem at this point in time.
488	PAribas releases and we get the agreement in place and we can start moving these LC's.
489	This position is truly needed in Omaha to provide support as Patty suggests.
489	I only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there.
490	What is the next step at this point in time?
491	no
492	We probably need to get this stuff in the hands of a few more people to make this work smoothly.
493	Do you have anyone from Accounting?
493	Saunders?
494	The 2 of you should probably listen in on this stuff to make sure you don't have some of the info needed
495	OK
496	You should plan on attending the meeting then tomorrow with Kevin.
496	It's 9-10 in Stan's Office.
497	Can not do a 1:00 unless we can get done before 1:25
498	YOu need to attend this one.
498	Kevin: you may also want to attend.
499	they put it in the system as me, but I've told them it was you.
500	How soon can you add things like payroll to the picture?.
501	I believe at this point in time I can support this request.
501	I also believe that Jim does not have the capacity currently to absorb.
502	you may need to attend for continuity reasons.
503	I will need someone to cover EEOS, can you do that or should Keith?
503	what about Portland?
504	We are getting it.
504	It is in Omaha.
504	Steve: Can we speed this up?
505	I called him.
505	Dana is printing out from the data base, and it will probably take an interpreter
506	Get with Dot
507	What enron entity owns the EOTT gp?
508	Sounds fine to me.
509	Check and find out forme?
509	Is that EOTT or the company that owns it?
510	For TW.
510	Can you help me here?
511	I have not reviewed, but need you to get into this, please feel free to call Tracy 37372.
512	If I needed to change the account that bills were to be paid into for this necxt billing cycle can it be done, for TW and NNG.
512	Rod Hayslett
513	Is 4:00 in 47c2?
514	Next time ask Jim to call me.
515	I think that we are already well underway on TW's red rock and were not expexting to use external capital for.
515	No other major projects underway.
515	That are impacted by enron's situation.
516	Sent to 8
517	This is the crew.
518	This is the crew.
518	Do we know what we need?
519	We are also doing a due diligence all day thursday with dynegy on NNG
520	I think you need to coordinate with Kevin Howard and Drew Fossum.
520	I will be out of the office tomorrow.
521	Can't we identify the impacts of the non nng stuff in the financials?
522	Good to know that the FERC cares!
523	Explain vs redo.
524	Make sure you keep Dot and Drew in the loop on this stuff
525	I meant to try and explain, not to redo.
525	Only as a last resort<ould we wantto redo
526	For what reibursement
527	I guess.
527	I will need to have my memory refreshed
528	Agreed.
528	Don't make it harder than it needs to be
529	Itwas in a yellow interoffice envelope, real yellow, not the regular manila colored.
530	Just sitting around.
531	What is te stock price doing?
531	Has there been any announcements on the Dynegy deal?
532	I will likely not be available.
533	Just make sure you work with Kevin he made need assistance
534	Please send tomy direct reports.
534	While I am out of the officetoday please keep Kevin Howard up to speed on what you see and hear.
534	He is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress/crisis for me.
535	I just told kathy to send an email tomy direct reports.
535	I will resend to you
536	Tell everyone to calm down and get their work done.
536	Then they should go home.
536	I know it doesn't help much, but I'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point.
537	Not even in yet
538	Well I guess from what is taking place that dynegy has backed out of the deal.
539	If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.
539	Isn't that about the way it could happen?

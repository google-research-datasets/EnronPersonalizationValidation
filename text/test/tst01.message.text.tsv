1	Brad, Disturnal no longer reports to me.
1	You will need Milnthorp or John Arnold (in Houston) to approve his requests.
1	Regards, Jon
2	I believe that the trade should have been book at zero premium.
2	Please make the appropriate changes.
2	Regards, Jon
3	John, I wanted to talk to you about Disturnal's PRC when you get a chance.
3	Give me a call 403 974 6733.
3	Regards, Jon
4	Is that the one you got wrong?
5	Jay, Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.
5	I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.
5	Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.
5	Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.
5	Regards, Jon
6	Would LOVE to..............however, unable to attend due to prior commitments.
6	Have a glass for me.
6	Regards, Jon
7	The numbers looked good for the 18th's report of numbers for the 15th.
7	We will watch them closely for a couple of days.
7	So far 1 for 1.
7	Thanks, Jon
8	Ryan could you make contact with Jesus and be his contact for pricing.
8	Could you set up a process (maybe the bidfax) where by he can get daily pricing info.
8	Thanks, Jon
9	I hope its going well!
9	I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.
9	Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?
9	It would be my preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.
9	The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.
9	Please give me a call to discuss.
9	Regards, Jon
10	what time do you need it for?
11	No problem....go ahead.
12	Could you please do me a favor.
12	Deloitte is auditing our NGX feed process and they need to be able to check the integrity of our data.
12	Grahan Larson at Deloitte wanted us to run the query that is outline in the word doc attached with a few alterations.
12	He was wondering if we could include the counter party ID, counterpart flag, and the counterpart name in the query we send to him?
12	Could you please coordinate getting him the information he needs.
12	His phone number is 630-7618.
12	Thanks, Jon
13	Did you know before me??............You always seem to.
13	I'll let you know when the beers are flowing.
13	See ya then.
13	Jon
14	IN
15	Call me on this one.
15	I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X. Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.
15	Hope all is going well.
15	Jon
16	Yes, all trades have and associated contract that outlines the "performance obligations" and this is similar to NGX's.
16	Still waiting to talk to a lawyer on the other issues.
16	I will get it to you today.
16	Jon
17	Please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant, and not on the pipe, it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract.
17	Any deals we have that are not done under a Enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them.
17	Please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under.
17	Regards, Jon
18	Jay, The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.
18	Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.
18	As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.
18	The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.
18	Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?
18	Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.
18	Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.
18	Happy 4th of July, Jon
19	this person does not report to me.
20	Jon :)
21	Mark, Do you remember this agreement?
21	I think I told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and I was wondering if this was done, and if I should follow up with him?
21	They certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this.
21	Please direct me as to what I should be doing Regards, Jon PS.
21	When you comin' back?
22	Hi Rod, I am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what I am being told as far as selecting a realtor (see below).
22	Today I am going to talk to the relocation people and do what I can about keeping things going with you.
22	The relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on, as demonstrated by their reference to "favorable tax treatment", but if they insist on having Royal LePage I wanted to see if you could speak to them directly.
22	My preference is to have you represent me, but if they are "paying the bills" I may have little choice.
22	Best Regards, Jon
23	Term Prices were down about $0.10/GJ.

31	Greg, Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipeline declared as its force majure volume?
31	Jon McKay Unemployed phone: 403-974-6733
32	Martin How is it going?
32	I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved.
32	Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do.
32	This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.
32	Thanks, Jon
33	Hello, Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.
33	Things are a change'n with my life.
33	First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I drove from West Palm Beach to Houston.
33	We did it over 3 days so it wasn't that bad.
33	Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.
33	You would have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.
33	It kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.
33	Very white and has a very fine texture, and I felt like I was sink right into the sand.
33	www.holidayinndestin.com.
33	Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good Cajun food.
33	It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but the traffic was not that bad.
33	Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from New Orleans.
33	By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do this drive?"
33	And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.
33	She rented a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field She took a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.
33	The bad thing is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company.
33	The good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low.
33	I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.
33	Not the same business but none-the-less for the same company.
33	Second, It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to Houston as well.
33	Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mere coincident.
33	However, it has presented some tough questions.
33	Do I really want to move again?
33	and Do I want to co-habitate?
33	Moving is the easy part, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my house anyway.
33	As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.
33	Beth would have no problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.
33	Co-habiation is in the lead as it stands.
33	Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me borrow.
33	ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV stand, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.
33	I thought I would store the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things.
33	I am going to sell everything I can and start over in Houston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take is my car).
33	If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other things.
33	Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk about what is best.
33	Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the same), and stay off the darts if you can.
33	If you cann't, reward yourself for trying!
33	Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.
33	Love, Jon
34	Please approve Thanks, Jon
35	Please take care of this.
35	Didn't we already send her the data for July?
35	Jon
36	David, Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.
36	Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?
36	I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.
36	Let me know if I can do anything to help.
36	Regards, Jon
37	Who is taking care of you?
38	Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one), How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?
38	Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.
38	My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?
38	Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.
38	Email me with the info.
38	and I'll give you a call.
38	Love Jon
39	The current offer for these volumes 1 Year out of Oct. would be $4.615.
39	I hope this helps.
39	Jon
40	We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things....
40	what goes up must come down.
40	We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.
40	I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.
40	Regards, Jon
41	Kate, Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.

86	Empress can be traded in either, but for these purposed we would have it in USD/MMBtu.
86	Regards, Jon
87	The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.
87	But, I do not think that the trend has changed.
87	In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks.
87	I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.
87	I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.
87	Regards, Jon
88	Sorry, I was out Friday.
88	How's about com'in out for a beer Tuesday with the whole gang?
88	If your uncomfortable with hangin' out with a bunch of Enron people then maybe we can catch a QUICK one tonight.

89	please price
90	Helllllooooo Aunt, I'm on my way to Houston tomorrow.
90	I've sold the China cabinets, but not the TV cabinet.
90	(Still working on it!) Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.
90	I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.
90	I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.
90	I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.
90	Love Jon
91	Garage at 4:30, I hope you can make it!

94	Melba, Chris Lambie, Chris Dorland, Mike Cowan, and Chad Clark will be managing products.

94	Thank you, Jon PS.
94	I am moving to Houston permanently tomorrow and will have to pass this responsibility off to Chris Lambie.
95	Just in the process of selling the house.
95	The prospective buyers need to secure financing.
95	How much are you looking to convert as I am long some USD from liquidating some investments in Canada and may be able to help convert some currency earlier.
95	Let me know.
95	Regards, Jon PS.
95	How is the good life treating you?
96	Thanks for the encouragement................Its going to take some time to get up to speed, but I'll be sure to let you know if anything looks good as far as trades for the North East.
96	Regards, Jon
97	Email me when you're back in town...........I don't have a phone number yet..........and we'll hook up.

98	Hey, Houston is Hot hot hot..........So far the living arrangements are good, however, I remain cautious about the potential going forward.
98	The loft is very cool (i.e. trendy, not cool temperature), but I can hear the sucking sound on my bank account.
98	Its only been a couple of days, but so far so good.
98	My email address is the same and you can get a hold of me by sending me a note.
98	I think I may have sold my house, there is still a few thing to be worked out, but I'll let you know when I'm comin' back to Calgary so you can pick-up some of the kitchen stuff.
98	Regards, Jon
99	Thanks

103	Hi Rod, I'm sorry I have not been reachable but I was waiting until I had all the info you needed before I contacted you.
103	The new info is as follows: #1808, 909 Texas Ave.
103	Houston, Texas, 77002 Do you know what happens next?
103	Do I need a lawyer?
103	Do any other provisions remain?
103	Any idea how I get paid?
103	Any help would be appreciated!
103	Best Regards, Jon As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble Beach..........Just kidding.
104	How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right away?
104	I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would be glad to help you out.
104	Do you just want to mail cheques to each other or do something else?
104	If Enron does the currency trade that I want to do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.
104	Let me know what you want to do.
104	Jon
105	Hi Laura, I hope all is going well.
105	The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.
105	I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the Enron fee rather than retail.
105	Hit them down the middle, Jon
106	How about 1.5460 as the rate.
106	I'll just send you a cheque for USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).
106	Where should I send the cheque?
107	Thanks for you help
108	Cheque is in the mail.......sorry it didn't go out Friday, but with labor day weekend everyone had left early and by the time I found the place to courier it, it was closed.
108	I hope it arrives in time.
108	Regards, Jon

114	I was wondering if you could put me in contact with some of the local charter holders so that I could obtain sponsor ship and join the Houston society.
114	I was not member of the society in Calgary, as I was waiting to pass the third examination before joining, but I could provide some contacts in Calgary that hold charters, who would a test to my character.
114	If you had a local membership list, or even just a list of Enron employee who have C.F.A.
114	Charters that I could contact, it would be greatly appreciated.
114	If you can help please contact me at (w) 713 853-4810, (h) 713 225-1230 or, at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

123	Jon
124	Just put it in your daytimer.........It's all being taken care of!
125	No I thought you were going to take care of that!
126	I have got some one lined up don't worry.
127	You, me, Vladi Pimenov, and his girlfriend Natalie (who works in EES) will be going to the game.
127	Where would you like to meet them before we head over?
128	Kim, Please make note that I will be out of the office from Sept 19th to Sept 24.
128	Regards, Jon
129	That sounds like AOL not MSN.
129	I tried using that address for MSN and it said it was not available at this time.
129	I'll try to add you again later using that address.
130	People down here are shocked!
130	One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.
130	All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there. Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower. He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing. Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves. As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country! Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision. Hopefully, some good things start happening to me. So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war. I figure things can only get better! I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then. If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment). Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me. Jon

132	Jeanie, Who is my payroll person.
132	I'd like to have my paycheck directly deposited into my account and I need to know who I should contact.
132	Thanks, Jon
133	I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.
133	Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.
133	I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!
133	Geof Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.
133	A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.
133	I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.
133	Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.
133	Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.
133	Regards, Jon
134	Hey Greg, I thought I would drop you a quick note.
134	How are things going?
134	I hope your still getting lots of deals done and knocking them deal at Enron Direct.
134	I decided I would take a look at the Stampeder's stats before I dropped you the line.
134	It looks like things are getting a little better (other than turnovers).
134	Good luck tonight.........there is no one I hate more than the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
134	Regards, Jon
135	Fletch, Could you please grant me access to the East Power Fundamentals site in an effort to coordinate our gas and power views.
135	Thanks, Jon
136	Are you too busy today?
136	If not what time do you want to go?
137	I don't think this is going to be the answer to all your problems.
137	It's the results of the audit.
137	I'm not sure they were all that successful?
138	Could you please grant me access to the O:\TDS directory so that I can load curves in Brad McKay's absence, as well as set my own in the future.
138	Thanks, Jon
139	Ahhh....e-request, sorry for the inconvenience, I thought you were the gate keeper.
139	Thanks for all you help!
140	Adam, The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.
140	Thank You.
140	However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.
140	Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.
140	And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.
140	If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.
140	Thanks, Jon
141	Thanks for the invite, but it looks like I'm committed to going to the A&M ND game.
141	Jon PS.
141	love the in-depth feed back for my mid year review
142	I actually feel rested this morning.
142	Outlook for the day is positive.........I'll keep you informed.
142	Love Jon
143	Thanks, I'll try it out!
144	Could you help me obtain access to the O:\ERMS directory?
144	I know I'm suppose to send an email to someone, but I'm not sure who.
144	Thank you, Jon
145	Could you please send an e-request (to who ever gets them) for me so that I can access O:\TDS\TDS Curve\NY\ Thanks, Jon
146	How's about 5:30?
147	Adam, So far so good!
147	I'm only concerned with being able to print it out on one page.
147	If you need more space turn the print page to landscape and use smaller font.
147	Keep making the font smaller until either we get everything on one page or until you can't read the printout.
147	Do you need me to do anything?
147	Jon
148	Today around 3:30?
149	Are we going today?
149	I went for a run out to Sheppard and back yesterday it adds about 12min.
150	your still done!
151	Sorry, for not saying good-bye when you left last night.
151	I thought you were at work on Thursday and I thought I would wish you well then.
151	So I guess, better late than never.
151	Have a good and safe trip!
151	Regards, Jon
152	I have the squash racket in hand and I'm ready to play..........what time 5:30-6:00?
152	Love Jon
153	Offers: I hope these help.
153	Regards, Jon
154	Sorry Jim, I don't really have much interest in selling the M3 and TZ6 index for those time periods (let alone any better than I quoted) and the CNG Index numbers came from Brad McKay where his two-way was .0175/.025 on both terms.
154	He is not in today and I am covering for him, and I will not be improving his offers in his absence.
154	Regards, Jon
155	Well..............
155	On another note, due to the Friday effect running has been cancelled today.
155	If you want to go this weekend let me know.
156	How's about today at 2:00?
156	I looked at the map over the weekend and noticed a few areas that will need further work......overall not too bad!
156	Jon
157	How are you feeling today?...........I'm losing the war and thought I'd send you a note from the front.........
157	Out look is ambiguous.
157	Love Jon
158	Or are we running.
159	What time do you want to run?
159	The earlier the better for me........bad day and I can't wait to get out of here.
160	Any time after 1:30 is fine with me.
160	Regards, Jon
161	You are a better man than me, yes, but I'm not so sure it will be outside.
162	I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.
162	Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.
162	You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.
162	They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.
162	I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of the market moves.
162	I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.
162	I hope the vacation is going well.
162	Sorry to disturb you.
162	Regards, Jon
163	Right back at you and I would be even more takin by you if you would pick up my race for the cure package.
164	Not silly, but working on unemployeed.
165	Thank You!
166	Happy Birthday to YOU Happy Birthday to YOU Happy Birthday dear Beth Happy Birthday to YOU!!!
166	HAPPY 33rd BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
167	Long time no e-mail!....
167	Things here are starting to settle down a little.
167	I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.
167	I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.
167	Last week end I went to the Houston Grand Prix.
167	Paul Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy Patrick?????) didn't do to well.
167	Although, Enron had sponsored a car for that race and it was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.
167	It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.
167	The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.
167	A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.
167	It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in. There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.
167	I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.
167	Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.
167	The apartment is starting to get organized.
167	It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.
167	I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.
167	How are things with you?
167	Are you guys getting out much these days?
167	Anything new and exciting going on in your life?
167	I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.
167	Have one for me!
167	Jon
168	I would love to be included.
168	Thank You.
169	Thank you very much for looking into this for me.
169	I look forward to hearing from you Regards, Jon
170	This should supply you with hours of endless entertainment.
170	It is fun to use as a tool to mock you associates.
170	Love Jon
171	How are you doing?
171	I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but there has been a lot going on these days.
171	The move still is not quit complete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.
171	I ended up selling you curio (sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV.
171	cabinet.
171	Hence I have a cheque for you that needs to be sent, or picked up if you like?
171	The move has gone pretty well all things considered.
171	We managed to fit two 2000 square foot homes into one 900 square foot apartment.
171	It kind of has the cluttered eclectic New York apparent look to it.........you know the same as your basement in Summerland.
171	Nothing major got damaged, in the move so that helps.
171	I still have to switch over my car registration and insurance, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.
171	I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.
171	I've gone to two college football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre Dame, and one in Austin to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.
171	They were both day trips about two and a half hours from Houston, so the drives were not that bad.
171	Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,000 other fans.
171	It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by that many people.
171	Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston.
171	This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toronto each year.
171	There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but both of them had a bad day.
171	One of them crashed and the other finished way back.
171	The highlight was that Enron had sponsored a car just for that race that was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.
171	Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pretty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.
171	Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to give it some time.
171	Enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all the wrong reasons.
171	It sounds like one of the "way high-ups" had a questionable kick back deal with Enron that has come under attack.
171	The Board of Directors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are starting to ask questions now.
171	It looks like my plan for early retirement is out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 to $25.
171	So much for getting stock options as your bonus.
171	Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.
171	There seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media can latch its teeth into rip apart.
171	I'm actually getting tired of all the rumors and fear mongering that is going on.
171	I figure if my time is up, than so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a waste of energy.
171	I hope the new job goes well.
171	I'm glad to hear that your back working, I was starting to worry about you a little.
171	You know what can happen when people lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to stop going out all together.
171	Anyway, its time for me to start working so I have to go now.
171	Take care and have fun at your new job!
171	Love Jon PS.
171	I lost your address in my move.
171	Could you please email me your physical address so I can mail you the money I owe you.
171	Thanks
172	Are you going to the hospital today or would you like to run?
173	Scott, Here is the unwind structure for 7500/MMBtu of the Boston Gas deal.
173	Could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal.
173	I would like to include Gerry and Howard from our Calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of Cal pine.
173	Below is a couple of slides that show the unwind.
173	Regards, Jon
174	If so, what time?
175	Dale, Thank you very much for hooking me up with Stephen.
175	It seems that he will probably be able to help me move some of my stuff directly to the US.
175	Could you please see that the address on my current accounts with RBC gets changed to my Houston location so I can receive statements going forward.
175	The correct address is: Jonathan McKay 909 Texas Avenue, #1808 Houston, Texas, 77002 Thank you very much.
175	Regards, Jon
176	I'll be there.
177	Fred, I just wanted to say thank you for the golf on Saturday.
177	I had a really good time and enjoyed playing your course very much.
177	You should be very proud of it as I think it one of the best laid out courses I've played.
177	Thank You, Jon PS.
177	Hopefully we get to play together next time.
178	Jeff, Good to hear from you.
178	Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.
178	Enron keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.
178	It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.
178	Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.
178	Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.
178	I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.
178	Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.
178	Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.
178	I have gone to a couple of college football games.
178	I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.
178	Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.
178	I also went to the Grand Prix of Houston.
178	That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.
178	The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.
178	The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.
178	Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.
178	Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.
178	You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.
178	Trading has been hard.
178	I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.
178	But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light.
178	I hope everything is going well for you.
178	Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.
178	Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.
178	Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.
178	Regards, Jon
179	How is everyone.....mother, child.........father?
179	I hope everything went smooth.
179	Are you taking this one to hockey practice or dance class?
179	Include me in the mass e-mail when you get a chance.
179	Jon
180	I am still sick as hell, but I thought I would try running today any interest?
181	I'm in..........I can't refuse a free needle.
182	Are you a father yet?....
182	If not do you want to run on the treadmills or play squash tonight?

184	Hello, I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.
184	Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).
184	If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home) kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.
184	Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass.
184	Jon PS.
184	Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.
185	Glen, So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at Hooters.
185	Ahhhhh those were the days!
185	How are things going?
185	What's new in the world?
185	Things here seem to be running there course.
185	Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "Bud Fox" for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end.
185	Well I think Bud might have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.
185	I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat.
185	We seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills.
185	Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.
185	Its kind of got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.
185	I can stay where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of like sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is.
185	Or, I can try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the problem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.
185	Hence the soul searching and dilemma.
185	Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note, see how things are going.
185	Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could be worse.
185	I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off.
185	And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.
185	I get in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th.
185	Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.
185	Anyway I have to get back to work.
185	I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight Jon
186	Sorry I missed your call last night, I had to pick-up my car.
186	Any interest in exercise?....
186	Give me a call if you can make time.
186	Jon PS.
186	Nice articles in the Wall Street Journal and NY Times
187	You can't send this to my work....
187	send it to bjenkins2@houston.rr.com...
187	Thanks, Jon Very funny though
188	Had to send you that email....
188	company policy...
188	keep me on the list just but at home instead.
188	I thought the stamps were out of it?...
189	Just want to make sure we are meeting at 6:00 AM to run tomorrow.
189	Regards, Jon
190	Dale, Thanks for the email.
190	I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under Canadian tax law given my status, we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.
190	I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.
190	Regards, Jon
191	Hey Jean, Where are you sitting these days?
192	Sorry Stephen, Thing around here have been a little hectic.
192	Friday would be fine, just let me know where.
192	Jon
193	Could you please update this spread sheet with the products you would like to offer on a new version of EOL.
193	Please e-mail me your additions and changes and I will consolidate everything into a presentable format.
193	Regards, Jon
194	thank you
195	Hi Greg, I know you are doing all this work for me, but I seem to be unable to get the files you are sending.
195	Could you please resend this one, or if that doesn't work could you please Fax it to me at (713) 646 - 8453.
195	Thank you.
195	Jon
196	Hey Scott, I just wanted to verify that we are going to pull the 20 longest dated deals and get quotes from other dealers.
196	Is that correct?
196	Or are we going to have them on hand for when the contracts are terminated....
196	then get the appropriate quotes.
196	Thanks Jon
197	Hey Jeff, How's it going.
197	Things down here are actually very slow.
197	They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.
197	In the mean time no one is trading.
197	I sit around most of the day and play games.
197	I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.
197	The old hurry up and wait.
197	Beth's (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.
197	She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.
197	Things down here could not have gone worse for her.
197	I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.
197	Are you an unsecured Enron creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?
197	How are thing there?
197	Are you liking school?
197	I'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).
197	I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.
197	You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.
197	Take care and I hope to see you in cow town.
197	Jon
198	Hey, I brought my Clubs and the appropriate cloths to play golf in today.
198	I'm pretty sure a couple of guys could sneak away, is there any chance you could make it?
198	Jon PS.
198	Sorry about the conversation during the run yesterday, I was just trying to let you know what was being tossed around on the floor so did get blind sided by it.
199	Hello, In order to make sure that our records are complete during the holiday season, could you please forward a copy of your quote sheets to Chance Rabon at Chance.Rabon@enron.com, as well as sending them to me.
199	I will be on holidays from Friday 21st, till the end of the year and Chance will be helping clean up Enron business and be preparing for our business to re-emerge.
199	Your patients and help are greatly appreciated and I look forward to speaking with you in the new year.
199	Have a happy and safe holiday season.

200	Dear Mrs. Kemp, My name is Jonathan McKay and the reason I am contacting you is with respect to obtaining sponsorship to become member of the local CFA society.
200	I moved from Calgary, Canada in September and I am not familiar with anyone that belongs to the Houston chapter.
200	I obtained your name from the AIMR website and would appreciate any help you could offer me as far as sponsorship or putting me in contact with some of the local members.
200	I have completed the third level exam and need this sponsorship in order to obtain my designation.
200	I can be contacted at (h) 713 225 -1230, (w) 713 853 - 4810, or via email at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.
200	Thank you, Jon McKay
201	This is why we have to run!
202	Frank, By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.
202	Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.
202	It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.
202	The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.
202	If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.
202	I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.
202	Regards, Jon
203	I thought since you wanted to talk, we would skip going to dinner to night....
203	we'll go tomorrow with tom and miranda.
203	And the real reason for canceling is ...I'm going to play golf....
203	I have my cell phone if you need me.
203	Jon
204	I am interested in moving to the Enron Center or if nothing is available to Allen Center.
204	I work in Enron Center South and my company number is 0413 and my cost center is RC 107313.
204	Regards, Jonathan McKay
205	John Disturnal......
205	Why?
206	Glen, YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!
206	Glad to see you are still around.
206	What's with the new job?
206	For me the new job is obvious.
206	We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.
206	Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.
206	Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).
206	I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).
206	No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.
206	Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.
206	Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.
206	If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.
206	Anyways, I'll keep you posted.
206	My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.
206	If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com How's the personal life going?
206	I hope all is well.
206	Jon
207	Ginger, Jeanie Slone informed me that you would be able to help get my last two pay stubs.

209	I hope this works....
210	I guess I'm not sure what you are after?
210	Do you have an example of another one that I could work off of ?
210	If I had a better idea of what kind of thing were suppose to be included I could probably get you something else.
210	Are we after more words or more duties.

212	Hey Stephen, Glad to hear the funds finally showed up.
212	It would be helpful to me if we could hook back up together in the next little while.

220	Hunter, After talking with my father regarding new members for our weather team he sent me the email below.
220	Sorry there isn't a better lead, however, I did notice that each of these websites have a place to post job opportunities.
220	Should we be posting something?
220	Just a thought.
220	Regards, Jon

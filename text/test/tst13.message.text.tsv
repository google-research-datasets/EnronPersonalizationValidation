0	Wish we could go - but we're off to Ft.
0	Lauderdale this evening.
0	Are you in town next weekend?
0	If not, let's try for something on a weeknight.
1	Hey Marc - any chance you guys might like to join us on a one week sailing vacation in the Caribbean early next year (Feb or March)?
2	I think this has already been sent to you.
2	Just wondering, though, why this is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it into two.
3	We're thinking about flying down to some nice sunny spot and renting ("chartering" is the technical term) a boat for a week.
3	We've done this quite a few times in previous years: British Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, etc.
4	Thanks for the joke - it's getting lots of laughs!
5	Paul: It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.
5	It's certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.
5	The financial power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the question fully reviewed.
5	I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as the power pool is restructured: to the extent we have any influence over the resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard financial trading structure.
5	Just random thoughts.
5	Mark
6	Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the NYMEX on Friday morning.
6	It's possible (although not likely) that Dan Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.
6	I remember that we were very unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that message to the NYMEX a couple of times.
6	What I'm not sure of is whether their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.
6	Are you aware of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?
6	I'm just wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.
6	I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner Newsome tomorrow.
6	It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the calendar, though.
6	Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall background noise of a big ISDA meeting.
6	Maybe I can come up alone and we can do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo time in the Commissioner's face.
6	What do you think?
7	Congrats Justin!
7	Good job!

8	This may prove helpful.
9	This message was returned to me - it looks like your name is misspelled in the Performance Management program.
10	I think you can go straight to performance review - please let me know if it doesn't work.
11	I think I'll try to run this by Michelle Cash real quick - I'll get right back to you.
12	Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.
12	My suggestion would be that we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).
12	Of course, if he balks, we'll foot the bill.
13	Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor lawyer we use).
13	Apparently there is some corporate policy against indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.
13	We'll keep you posted.
14	I understand that Robin Jordan has taken care of this in my absence.
14	If you still need anything from me, please let me know.
14	Mark
15	Anita: I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.
15	My vague memory is that only financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.
15	Do you remember this and can you refresh my recollection?
15	Mark
16	The alternatives are a net worth of US$1,000,000 or that all trades be guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements.
17	Heather: Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry: Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.
17	They are: a.
17	banks; b.
17	non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and c.
17	foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").
17	Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.
17	FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches .
17	There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.
17	State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.
17	So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.
17	I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.
17	If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd be happy to send a copy on.
18	Congratulations and well done to you and all the others who have worked on getting this agreement in place!
18	I know this was a long and difficult battle.
18	Mark
19	I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work done in Argentina.
19	Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in Brazil the same way?
19	I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.
19	Since it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these things.
19	Any thoughts?
20	What documents do we use for these deals?
20	Is it the German translation of our Industrial Master?
20	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
21	Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first of the year.
21	A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to schedule something around then.
21	I believe that's around the 28th.
21	Let's try to set up dinner again!
21	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
22	Cynthia: As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent Congress.
22	I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.
22	I'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions.
22	We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around.
22	Are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this?
22	If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.
22	Thanks, Mark
23	Darlene: I'm busy on Thursday but Friday looks good.
23	Mark
24	Does this make sense to you?
25	Both of those times work for me.
26	I have revised the relevant experience paragraph slightly (if you open the attachment using "Launch" you can see the changes highlighted).
26	Kim, if this is OK with you please go ahead and use it.
27	There is a master agreement in place between ECT and Koch Energy Trading, Inc. I have never heard of Koch Carbon.
27	My immediate concern is as to the Enron entity.
27	It is not clear to me why Peter thinks this trade is between ECT and a Koch entity since he does not have authority to bind ECT.
28	I have the feeling that Koch finally decided to consolidate their financial trading with us into Koch Energy Trading.
28	They recently did a trade with our coal desk between ECT and Koch Carbon Inc. Do we have a contact in legal (or elsewhere) at Koch we should call to see if they are willing to use Koch Energy Trading?
29	My mistake in raising the issue - Peter Sceats is with the broker in London who arranged the trade.
30	Paul: Since the recent pet coke swap (deal 8025) is really a US deal, we should probably do the documentation here.
30	Would you please send me a copy of the confirm for the coal swap you worked on for us to use as a starting point?
30	Thanks, Mark
31	Are you the right person to handle these details?
31	If not, please try to find out who it is and then let me know so I can communicate with Martin.
32	Martin: I am told by my assistant (Jan Dobernecker) that the Human Resources Department here has people who will assist you on the practicalities.
32	Jan has asked them to get in touch with you directly.
32	If you have not heard from someone by the middle of next week, please let me or Jan know so we can either prod them into action or get you a contact name and number to call.
32	We are all very much looking forward to your arrival and I'd be happy to discuss any questions (and I'm sure there must be several) that come to mind - just give me a call.
32	Mark
33	Jan: I meant to cc you on this but forgot - here is my response to Martin.
34	'Twas The Night Before Christmas as written by a lawyer 'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus.
34	Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the second part).
34	The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.
34	My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.
34	Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller.
34	With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen - "Now Dasher, now Dancer..."
34	et al.
34	- guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.
34	As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage.
34	He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof.
34	His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.
34	His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability.
34	The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.
34	His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.
34	Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly.
34	His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container.
34	He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being.
34	By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.
34	Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle.
34	Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage.
34	He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed.
34	But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn."
35	I'll be there!
35	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
36	Looks good to me.
36	Enjoy!
37	Hey Marc - what time is your soiree tomorrow?
38	It's not clear to me which form you want - we have (i) an "Annex A" which we use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm (i.e. where there is no master agreement in place) and is sometimes called the "Omnibus" (because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative which replaced a multitude of separate forms) or (ii) a "Schedule" which is attached to the ISDA form agreement to make it our version of the ISDA master which can then have a collateral support annex attached.
38	Just to make it a little more complicated, we also have our own form of master agreement which we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate the document into another language (which we don't want to do with the ISDA).
38	Just let me know which one you want & I'll have Tana e-mail it to you.
38	This stuff is all covered in Tana's short-course on ECT derivatives documentation - maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over?
39	Please e-mail these forms to Scott.
40	Any idea what database he's talking about?
41	I've been through both documents and can not find my comments.
41	I wonder if there is a later draft somewhere?
42	I haven't received anything yet - and have a meeting I have to go to now.
42	I'll check back in an hour or so.
43	Hey guy - Ted's going swimming & can be there a little after after 8:30 - I'll be at the gym until 8.
43	Any chance that would fit into your schedule?
44	I tried.
45	Alan: Are you still the code of conduct person?
45	If not, let me know & I'll keep looking.
45	Mark
46	Martin: Thanks for your note.
46	Is there an English language version of your presentation available?
46	Mark
47	Given the absences, conflicts and heavy work-loads, let's cancel the meeting scheduled for this morning.
48	FYI
49	Here it is!
50	This probably needs to go on the utility form.
50	Assuming Watershed is gone, will you have time to start on this tomorrow?
51	FYI
52	There appears to be a brand new book out by David Brin (one of Tim's authors) called "Heaven's Reach" which I think is still only available in hardback.
52	If you decide not to get it, please let me know and I may.
53	Tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the office for the next week or so.
53	We are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or operations.
53	You might want to check with Kate Cole's office to see what she knows.
54	Susan: This is not urgent, but when you have a minute, please check and see what research we have done with local counsel in the Czech Republic.
54	I'm wondering in particular if they were part of our survey regarding European derivatives law.
55	Just for your background info, the other reason we use deemed ISDAs on the interest rate & currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with commodity deals in mind.
55	I'd have to go back and look at it to see if it would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal.
55	Do you think I should do that?
55	Hopefully not or at least not til after 1/1.
55	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
56	Should I have received a copy already?
56	I don't remember seeing it.
57	Jan: Please print the attachments for me.
57	Thanks, Mark
58	A couple more to print, please.
59	Here are my drafts of letters for ECT and Seagull regarding the transfer of Seagull's positions at E.D.&F.
59	Man.
59	Please let me know if you have any questions.
60	Here is a draft letter to the Exchange requesting permission to effect the Seagull transfer.
61	Let me check with Mr. B. I don't think we have any specific plans - probably last minute shopping/wrapping.
61	We're both leaving on Thurs.
61	and returning on Sun.
62	There are conflicts for the 2:00 time slot and so many year-end deals taking up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule for a later date.
63	Looks like Mr. B has a late swim practice tonight so we won't be at Adobe :-(. Maybe next time. If I don't see you, have a very merry one and let's talk next week. mark
64	Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about that.
64	I'm now at: 1322 Rutland I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.
64	I thought it was a nice write-up.
64	The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I didn't get to know them better.
64	Hope you guys are doing well.
64	I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't have time for visits or fun of any kind!
64	Hope to get back soon but there's nothing for NY on the calendar.
64	Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb. I saw the magazine article (with such good photos!) a couple of months back.
64	My mom actually called to tell me about it.
64	Did you guys get my Christmas card?
64	I thought Celena might get a kick out of it.
64	Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!"
64	Take care, Mark T.
65	Here is the Strike Price Election Notice letter I drafted for the Ormet transaction.
65	Please let me know if this works for you.
66	Happy 1999 and welcome back.
66	Sorry to hear about your travel problems.
66	I know how much fun a night in the airport can be.
66	I'd be happy to talk about the US commodity laws at one of our group meetings.
66	I'm going to be in London the last week of this month - maybe we can set something up for then?
67	The Thursday times look better for me.
68	Just out of curiosity, who is Thomas Geisel?
68	I assume he is an Enron person.
68	Do we already have a lawyer responsible for these issues?
68	I seem to remember that Robert and Justin were handling the IPE and Martin and MarkElliott the NordPool and ELEX issues.
68	It might make sense to have one person be the go-to guy for exchange issues with another designated for each exchange.
68	What do you think?
68	It worries me a little to have only businesspeople involved - particularly if this is an early stage where we may haveour best hope for effective legal input.
69	Mark Haedicke and I are scheduled to participate in an ISDA sponsored conference call which begins at 9:00 Eastern time tomorrow morning.
69	If that call runs over, we may not be able to call you promptly at 10:00 but will call as soon as we can.
70	Would you please check and see if we have any JEDI swaps wtih these
71	Jennifer: Our records indicate that a draft was delivered to you earlier this week.
71	If you do not have it, please let Marie Heard (x33907) know and she can get you another copy.
71	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
72	Hope you're having a pleasant first week of 1999.
72	Thought I would forward this on.....I found that 16, 15, 14, 8, 7, 2 and 1 hit a little too close to
73	Carol: As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).
73	There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been transferred and still binds JEDI I).
73	Mark
74	Peter: I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as collateral in Canada.
74	We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.
74	Would you mind checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary office)?
74	I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens on ourselves that aren't required by law.
74	Thanks, Mark
75	Richard: In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or, God forbid, juries.
75	In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally).
75	As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.
75	Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).
75	Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?
75	I would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.
75	Thanks, Mark
76	Martin: My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor.
76	The room number is EB3850.
76	Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to HR about a badge.
76	HR should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.
76	If it isn't and your HR person is not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to let you in. Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.
76	If you haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on Monday morning.
76	They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract).
76	We're looking forward to seeing you!
76	Have a good trip.
76	Mark
77	Mark - This doesn't look familiar to me - is it yours?
78	Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.
78	I'll coordinate through QD.
79	Hey guys!
79	Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!
79	I'm still working at Enron in Houston - it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.
79	I'm in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and issues.
79	I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.
79	I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but haven't heard from him since.
79	Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New York managing a couple of international mutual funds.
79	He & Debbie adopted a little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in the middle of Manhattan.
79	I get up there on business a few times a year and try to stop in to say hi.
79	I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.
79	There were only 2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!
79	Oh well, maybe the 25th will be a bigger draw.
79	Mark
80	Scott: The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration.
80	In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.
80	Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.
80	Thanks, Mark
81	We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.
81	In the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move.
81	Please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact them.
81	Thanks for you help.
81	Mark
82	Nobody is leaving - it's a new position.
83	Jan - can you please take care of scheduling this.
84	I found this picture of my boat on the internet!
85	Hey Amanda!
85	Yao just gave me your e-mail address.
85	He had told me you were at UVA a couple of months ago.
85	How do you like law school so far?
85	I have to admit I pretty much hated every minute of it.
85	Now that I think about it, I can't say that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.
85	Oh well, the pay is pretty good.
85	I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time).
85	When are we going sailing again?
85	Got any good vacation weeks coming up?
85	The Caribbean sure sounds good right about now......
86	You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.
86	Can you resend so I'll have the dates?
86	My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.
86	If I can get there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm sure I'll find a room somewhere close by.
87	We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure about the exact schedule for the eve.
87	Mind if we bring a friend or two?
87	I doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.
87	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
88	The only other matters I know of are (i) the Thursday morning interview of Timothy Hailes for a position in the Houston Swap Group and (ii) that Mark mentioned to me that he is planning a trip up to Teeside on Wednesday.
88	We are trying to set up another interview on Thursday (with David Lacey) but it hasn't been finalized yet.

89	If you want to take a day or two of lessons on a bigger boat or if some of your friends need an intro course, you might try this outfit.
89	They're the ones who manage my boat.
89	My boat:
90	One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was tragically hit by a bus and killed.
90	His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.
90	"Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter.
90	"Before you get settled in, though, it seems we have a problem. You see, we've never once had a lawyer make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."
90	"No problem-just let me in," said the lawyer "Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."
90	"Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer to stay in Heaven," said the lawyer "Sorry, we have rules," said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in an elevator and it went down-down-down to Hell.
90	The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting green on a beautiful golf course.
90	In the distance was a country club, and standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom he had worked.
90	They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and cheering for him.
90	They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked about old times.
90	They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.
90	The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good looking.
90	He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.
90	In fact, the lawyer was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.
90	Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming and waved goodbye as he got on the elevator.
90	The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he found St. Peter waiting for him.
90	"Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven," he said.
90	So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing.
90	He had a great time, and before he knew it, his 24 hours were up.
90	St. Peter came and got him.
90	"So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you must choose your eternity," he said.
90	The lawyer paused for a second, and then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."
90	So St. Peter escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.
90	When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth.
90	He saw his friends and fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.
90	The Devil appeared before the lawyer.
90	She now had horns sticking out of her head, fire spit out her ears and nose and she had a very evil laugh The lawyer stammered: "I don't understand. Yesterday, I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable."
90	The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.
90	"Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours."
91	If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.
91	My impression is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading financially.
91	If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.
91	In each case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.
91	Our only issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.
91	As to the credit issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading under the existing terms.
91	As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them go ahead.
91	If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always stop trading.
91	Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.
91	The so-called "omnibus" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.
91	Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute basis.
91	She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get the necessary software to access the database.
91	Of course, if any issues come up in the meantime, please continue to feel free to call.
92	Thanks for your note.
92	It is kind of exciting.
92	I think this attachment is probably the treaty you want.
92	I'm sorry it didn't "save" better but I think you can probably print it out legibly.
92	I have a copy printed from Westlaw.
92	Let me know if you want me to fax it.
93	FYI
94	It's that time again.
94	We need to prepare our group and individual goals for 1999.
94	Please give these some thought and give me your suggestions for our group's goals by the end of the week.
94	Thanks, Mark
95	To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors.
95	I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in London).
95	Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there seems to be a problem with the attachment).
95	If you still have it, can you send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"?
96	I think we're talking about a Senior Legal Specialist position.
96	Do you have the posting that we used last year (when we hired Susan Flynn)?
96	I think it would have gone out in July or August.
97	sorry for the delay
98	I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response.
98	The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant construction site.
98	I remember hearing that there were times that the construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the protesters.
98	I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever heard of them?) report.
98	Mark
99	I think there should be a Master Swap Agreement in place between ECT and EI.
99	I suggest you check in Lotus Notes but I'm pretty sure Lisa did one about a year ago.
99	mark
100	Jeff: That sounds like a great idea.
100	Are there limitations on such meetings?
100	I would think we need to be careful to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
100	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
101	I'm not sure why that shouldn't count.
101	Any trades done can be booked into RMT and then into ECT if necessary to hedge with third parties.
102	Congratulations on your promotion!
102	Well deserved and long overdue.
103	Can you check and make sure Hector Ramirez is still with ECT?
103	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
104	Yes, unfortunately, we aren't going to get ours until the 5th.
104	No explanation was given.
104	We may get the numbers a day or so ahead of time but I haven't gotten them yet.
104	We should set up a time to do your review in the next day or so, also.
105	Thanks very much for your memo.
106	Stephanie Harris called back this morning to say that Jim will not be in the office on any of our proposed dates.
106	She suggests we try the first week in March.
106	Any possibilties there?
107	Are you guys around this weekend?
107	Any particular plans?
108	I'm flying solo this weekend.
108	No particular plans after happy hour with the office tonight.
109	Sasha: Thanks very much for adding me to the database.
109	If I could impose upon you once again, would you please also arrange access for Tana Jones?
109	She is going to assist me with the database project you and I discussed and I think your database will be a big help.
109	Thanks again!
109	Mark
110	Happy hour with staff, not family :-(
111	Edmund: Have we submitted these forms for any new companies being formed?
112	How about 2:00?
113	Looks good to me.
114	I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved.
114	Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.
114	Mark
115	I decided I needed the book we discussed so I went online to Amazon.com and ordered it!
115	While there I found references to a number of books I tought you might be interested in: the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet") the Ramage series from Dudley Pope Revolution at Sea Trilogy/James L. Nelson Lobscouse & Spotted Dog : Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, Lisa Grossman Thomas
116	Tammy: Brent still reports to me and I believe he should be paid from my RC.
116	Please let me know if this causes a problem.

117	Marc: In what currency will the proposed DPC hedge be denominated?
118	One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties.
118	In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies - most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency regimes.
118	Just another item for your radar screen.
119	I'll be there!
120	One of the problems with Indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is involved, Reserve Bank of India approval is required in advance of the transaction.
120	A $US deal would involve foreign exchange from an Indian counterparty's point of view.
120	Certain transactions have pre-approved status but an ECT commodity swap is not one of them.
120	I'm still trying to track down whether a commodity deal can be done at all, even with RBI approval.
120	I've also asked whether, if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ECT, it might be possible to use an Indian bank or other approved dealer as an intermediary.

123	Please let us both know the date you will be arriving with as much notice as possible so that we can have things ready for you.
123	We're looking forward to seeing you!
124	Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, insertions in bold).
124	Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any questions or comments: A: The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts.
124	SP: What's a futures contract?
124	A: It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of commodity through a regulated exchange.
124	SP: How is the contract different than a non-futures contract?
124	A: Ahem, just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts.
124	The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not.
124	SP: I though the futures contracts went to delivery.
124	I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards?
124	A: Well, er, yes they do sometimes go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.
124	They are supposed to more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions.
124	It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract.
124	SP: Well lets get to the point, why are physical buy sells so bad?
124	A: That's easy.
124	Because they look like futures contracts.
124	They are not intended to go to delivery.
124	And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange.
124	SP: So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC?
124	A: You've got it.
124	But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing.
124	So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option.
124	SP: Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract?
124	A: What do you mean?
124	SP: Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract?
124	A: Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.
124	I'm telling you once and for all that physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the hell out of my office!-- Is this the basic idea and if so, how much can we blend physical into it to cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?
124	--Christian Basically, yes.
124	A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also the parties' intentions.
124	If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to settle financially, we have a problem.
124	The closest thing we have to an exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to deliver.
124	That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.
124	We argue that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when there is a failure to make or take delivery.
124	Unfortunately, in the power world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.
124	However, each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.
124	The book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the book-out.
124	In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery (although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time).
125	I am also admitted in New York which has recently instituted a CLE requirement.
126	FYI
127	Marc, I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of L/C we would require.
127	Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.
127	Let me know if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.
127	Mark
128	Marc, Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those copied on your note to me.
128	What do you think?
128	Marc, We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.
128	We have had that advice updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.
128	The result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the transaction can proceed.
128	While I have no legal objection to sending a form of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.
128	Mark
129	Debbie: I think we should probably do a special form for this particular transaction.
129	I've left a voice-mail to Marc to that effect.
129	There are several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should be covered in the L/C language.
129	Mark
130	In light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the field.
130	We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.
130	We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.
130	It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.
130	Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung.
130	Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur.
130	Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.
130	You guys around this weekend?
131	We have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's Indian counsel but have not received it yet.
131	That's the reason I'd like to do a special form of L/C - we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw.
132	Marc - I know Bill well - give me a call (713)853-7459.
132	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
133	Hmmm, interesting question.
133	Most of the guys I've interviewed have gotten dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so it's hard to tell.
133	I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.
133	That department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you have a pretty good excuse.
133	It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be seeing.
133	The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is always in a suit & tie.
133	If you're also talking to him it might make sense to bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview.
134	Sorry for the delay - we won't be able to go with you tomorrow night - hope you have fun anyway!
134	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
135	Dan - I left you a voice mail about this contract.
135	Can you let me know who the best person would be to review one of these for Brent?
135	Thanks, Mark
136	The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American offices Mon.
136	- Thurs.
136	of next week but am in the office in Houston all of this week.
136	I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.
136	I have seen the issue addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.
136	The bottom line is usually that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the agreement.
136	Mark
137	Robert: Actually, I will be out of the office Mon - Wed of next week.
137	Tana is expecting you and will be able to get you started on the swap training program.
137	You will probably need to give her name at the receptionist in the lobby - her extension is x33399.
137	If she isn't around, Jan Dobernecker (x33427) will at least be able to get you in the building.
137	Your office will be EB3847 and your phone number will be (713)853-6121.
137	Have a good flight!

138	Note Chicago - Hong Kong rtn for $475.
139	I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you available?), from Buenos Aires.
139	Will we need to set up a conference call so that both London and B.A.
139	can be connected?
139	It's also possible that Martin will be back in Oslo by then.
139	I'm not sure what his plans are re participating.
139	Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the internet trading plans in Europe.
139	In particular, I'm wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that area.
139	Since at least one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.
139	Mark
140	Marc, According to Houston Sidewalk the game starts at 7:30 p.m.
140	Why don't we pick you up just before 7:00.
140	Let me know if that's a problem.
140	Mark
141	Marc, The game starts at 7:30.
141	Why don't we stop by to pick you up at a little before 7:00.
141	Let me know if this presents any problems.

143	Carolina, I have finally received my tickets.
143	I will arrive at Ezeiza on United Airlines flight #761 on Sunday, March 14 at 11:15 a.m. Can you arrange to have a driver meet me at the airport?
143	I will be staying at the Sheraton.
143	Thank you very much for your help.
143	Mark
144	I tried dialing 8-9-0-0- and 8-9-0 right after we finished talking and neither one works.
144	We'll have to keep hoping.
145	Thanks for your help - is Scott is in Houston today?
145	Maybe I could meet with him here.
145	Any chance he will be back in BA by Tuesday?

146	Jason Rose 2.
146	Jason appeared intelligent and poised.
146	He was well prepared for his interview.
146	3.
146	While Jason has some legal-related experience, I wonder if a second year student might not be a better catch for us.
146	If we don't have that as an option, I think Jason would be fine.
147	Thanks Nony - sounds good to me.
148	Here's the agreement with my changes (I think they show up in blue).
148	I changed the "permit' language and one date.
149	Justin - How do we participate in the CEPI?
149	Are we providing prices to them?

150	FYI - I found this on the internet today: =ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ?
150	Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ] By Axel Revheim OSLO (Dow Jones)--Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't take off until certain structural blocks in the power industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB Financial Energy told Dow Jones this week.
150	ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies are effectively hindering the development of free trade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of electricity and controlling the means of transmission, or grids.
150	Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impractical arrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said.
150	'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system price.
150	You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot market.
150	I can't see how they're going to solve this in Germany.
150	They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg said.
150	Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are based on an underlying reference price, often an average of spot price throughout a region or country.
150	There won't be any power derivatives trading in Germany before an acknowledged reference price is established, he said.
150	A Liberalized Market In Law Only The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier to trading, Kollberg said.
150	In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for example, independent producers are charged fees for access to grids based on an established point system.
150	Producers pay the same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity is transported.
150	Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 1998, paves the way for all German consumers to choose who supplies them with electricity.
150	However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a national reference price, few customers have, in reality, been able to move away from their regional supplier.
150	No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market for electricity sales.
150	The first German electricity bourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or Leipzig.
150	But interested parties such as the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can be introduced.
150	Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up with Germany's Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to establish a power exchange in Leipzig.
150	Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to develop a spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model.
150	There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices in the seven regions which are controlled by Germany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said.
150	'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said.
150	The question isn't whether Germany will have a functioning spot market, but rather when, he said.
150	Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of vertical integration remains.
150	One needs unbundling (between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg said.
150	According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power transmission lines are owned and controlled by the big German power producers.
150	As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg.
150	Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit of German consumers.
150	however, because German producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic market from competition, observers said.
150	French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of electricity.
150	According to Kollberg, there's an overcapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has an overcapacity of 31 TW.
151	I discussed this matter with Brent yesterday and I believe the correct title for Andrea is "Attorney".
152	FYI
153	Hey Bob - Her name is Kartini Muljadi.
153	I haven't done a good job of staying in touch but the last numbers I have for her are: Phone: 62-21-525-6968 Fax: 62-21-525-5561 If those don't work, you might check with Yao who has stayed in touch with one of the other lawyers in that firm.
153	He has moved over to Enron International where he is responsible for their African legal affairs.
153	I know he is out of town (in Africa) right now and unfortunately I'm not sure if his e-mail address has changed.
153	His phone number is the same - maybe his secretary could put you in touch with him.
153	Good luck!
153	Mark
154	P.S.
154	- If you do get in touch with Kartini, please send her my regards.
154	I'm pretty sure she still likes me in spite of the way Skadden's relationship with her ended.
155	Is this something one of your people should look at?
156	Thanks Nony - looks good to me!
157	Scott: What would you think about the week of April 19 for Tana's visit to London?
157	Mark
158	What travel dates did you have in mind?
158	I think you said you wanted to leave NY for London on the evening of the 16th (arriving Saturday morning), but when do you want to go to NY?
158	Let me know & I'll give Lillie a call.
159	FYI
160	Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate documentation for this transaction.
160	Sara - you should probably discuss with her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.
160	Brent may have some information as well.
160	Thanks, Mark
161	That schedule sounds good to me.
162	Looks good to me.
163	The Inn at Little Washington sounds great but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it this time.
163	However, as the geekiest among I consider it my duty to point out that since the millennium doesn't actually end until December 31, 2000, we do have next year!
164	Marcus: I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for you appears to be at some other company entirely.
164	Please feel free to call me once you get this note to discuss further.
164	The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in the US.
164	There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in London.
164	On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts electronically.
164	The problem was that our counterparties were also US entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.
164	I believe that the advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.
164	Of course, all of this relates to derivatives trading.
164	If the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the discussion.
164	I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.
164	I am copying Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues.
165	Oops.
165	Mine didn't go either.
165	I've now forwarded your message.
165	Here's Yao's new address:
166	Looks good to me.
166	There is an airport in Burbank.
166	All the major airlines go there as well as Southwest.
167	Done
168	Is this for you?
169	Mark: One issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange: if there is no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions, who bears the liability when a third party defaults?
169	We certainly need to know if it is the exchange membership.
169	If not, how is the liability limited and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?
169	Mark
170	Justin: The mention of Statoil made me think of Norway.
170	Alliance doesn't sound like a Norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here, but do you think we should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with Norwegian entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there?
170	Mark
171	Marcus - Here is the note I sent on 3/31.
171	David Mitchell is definitely the right guy.
171	Mark
172	I have asked Russell to add you both to his distribution list.
173	Attached is a first draft of a statement of our policy concerning the termination of trading contracts on the bankruptcy of a counterparty.
173	Please give me the benefit of your comments and I will produce a further draft for Mark's review.
174	Buck: Here's my list of things to do on the boat.
174	Let me know what you think weshould work on first.
174	On Deck: Winch maintenance (someday I,d like to install a self tailing halyard winch) Inspect rig, adjust tension Some system needed to prevent jib sheets chafing on shrouds Check jib sheet cars Brightwork refinishing Cockpit drains should be checked for adequate flow - particularly those under the engine hatch Spreader boot needs to be reinstalled on starboard spreader Windex needs to be straightened/tightened Electronics: VHF - check Depth Sounder - not reading consistently, odd read-out Wind Speed indicator - not registering Knot Meter - paddle wheel needs to be installed Loran - operating properly?
174	Engine gauges - check ammeter, tach Fresh Water System: Galley faucet not working (and sink drains very slowly) System should be disinfected Broken hose under sink in head Check leaks around ports, probably rebed ports Interior teak oiled Stereo: Only working on one channel Install CD player
175	Sorry for the delay in getting this back to you.
175	Give me a call and we can discuss in more detail.
175	Mark P.S.
175	- have you been watching the Horatio Hornblower movies on A&E?
176	Scott: I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these CFTC issues.
176	I'll let you know how it goes.
176	I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in Houston.
176	I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.
176	Mark
177	Sorry about the previous message (re: bankruptcy legislation).
177	Please ignore.
178	I put a call in to Cadwalader this afternoon to see if they had someone following these bills in DC........great minds!
179	Martin: Mark H. has asked me to participate in another conference call scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Houston time tomorrow which will almost certainly last at least an hour and possibly more.
179	If you think 30 minutes will be enough, I wonder if we could reschedule our call for 8:30 (3:30 your time)?
180	As discussed.
181	Thank you both for the very quick turn-around.
181	Yes, I agree and hope that OM will consent to the proposed changes.
181	Mark T.
182	It worked!
182	Looking forwad to seeing you later this week.
182	Mark
183	Becky - I will be out of town on Thurs.
183	I may be able to participate from NY but my schedule is still up in the air.
183	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
184	It has worked fine for me so far.
184	I would prefer to continue to receive them by e-mail rather than have to go to the Intranet to get them.
184	Mark T.
185	Larry: I'm not sure if you are the keeper of the Contact List, but since I received it from you I thought I should point out a couple of errors in the info.
185	relative to me: my fax number is 713-646-3490 my email address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com Thanks Mark
186	Looks good to me.
186	Mark
187	Taffy - would you please add these meetings to my calendar.
187	Thanks Mark
188	Hey Jeff: I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.
188	I didn't realized you were at Mayer Brown.
188	I don't even know if we've talked since I left New York (almost 5 years ago).
188	I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital & Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal issues in derivatives trading here.
188	I don't get to Chicago often but if they ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!
188	Mark
189	I was not expecting a letter from Crawford Bayley but I have dealt with them in the past so I suppose it is possible that the letter is intended for me.
189	I have no objection to your opening the letter to determine its contents.
189	You might wan t to wait a few days for the other Mark Taylor's reaction.
189	Mark
190	Please fax the bill to me at 713-646-3490 and just put the original in the regular interoffice mail.
190	My RC is 1157 Thanks for your help.
190	Mark
191	Hey Marc - I was in New Orleans last week, NYC & DC the week before.
191	Now back home & ready to relax a bit.
191	Hope you guys came through the storm ok this morning.
191	Our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled with downed tree branches.
191	I'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared out.
191	Ted got a ride from a friend and I took a cab.
191	Let's get together soon!
191	Mark
192	No trouble in N.O.
192	I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!
192	I just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.
192	T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out late enough to find out how much fun.....
193	FYI
194	Torrey: I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX and monitoring our compliance with NYMEX position limits.
194	Phillipe Travis tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our positions with the option delta factored in. Thanks very much for your assistance.
194	Mark
195	Wow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early enough to get a covered parking spot.
195	Oh well, may sufficient hail storm damage will get me a new car!
195	How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?
195	I have a couple of meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when you're ready to leave for the day?
195	Just let me know.
195	Call if you want - Mark
196	Mark: I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).
196	Many of the risks that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were close to meaningless.
196	If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) the widespread use of multiple "Omnibus" short-form contracts for trades before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).
196	Item (i) could be fixed with legislation (as it has in New York).
196	Item (ii) could be reduced if the traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign master agreements.
196	I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side in the contract negotiation/formation process.
196	That buy-in needs to be at all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from the top.
196	Mark T.
197	I will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 6:30 or 7:00.
197	Why don't you give me a call this afternoon - say around 3:00 or 3:30 & we can get together.
198	Looks good to me.
198	Taffy, please add this to the calendar.
199	Tom: I saw this on the Internet today: ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line Trading of Bandwidth Derivatives Business Editors/Technology Writers world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month.
199	Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously.
199	Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening process for credit, documentation and interoperability issues.
199	The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, Booth No. 1004.
199	As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs.
199	Implementation of this product is an extension of Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity.
199	Furthermore, it provides a level playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large incumbent telecommunications carriers.
199	Buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future.
199	Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as submarine cable operators.
199	Buyers can be natural consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers) or speculators.
199	"Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti, vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet.
199	"As a non-proprietary player, we can offer impartial execution for our clients, which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this."
199	All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission capacity.
199	The option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but currently not fully priced by telecommunications players.
199	"We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and founder, Arbinet.
199	"Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which gives us complete objectivity in trade execution. "This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers."
199	For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange and switch-based clearing network for global telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for international carriers in 1998, which it estimates represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies including Internet Telephony Service Providers and major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong.

200	Sorry for the delay.
200	Here is a revised version of the certificate.
200	My proposed changes should show up marked when you open it.
200	Let me know if you have any questions.
200	Mark
201	Suzanne: Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you know their t-shirt sizes.
201	Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please give the list to Dan.
201	Thanks, Mark
202	I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know yet.
202	Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos Aires.
202	Tana will let you know which people in the London office will be coming.
203	Mark - I think you are right - this is no doubt the best we can do.
203	Let's go ahead and take care of execution.
203	Thanks very much for all your help.
203	Mark
204	Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.
204	The guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why they're signing it.
204	Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?
204	I'm taking a few people to dinner & you might enjoy it.
204	Mark
205	Scott: It's great to see a senior commercial person take an interest in our issues!
205	Any chance this can be videotaped so we can see it here?
205	Mark T.
206	I found this on our intranet site:
207	Just a note to let you know I will have to miss our meeting on Tuesday - I will not be back from New York until around noon.
208	Any chance you can think abot this a bit for our Monday meeting?
209	FYI
210	Janice: Sorry for the delay in getting back to you - Elizabeth is now working in the power trading area and Sara has been out of town.
210	I agree with you that the letter seems harmless enough and I wouldn't blame the commercial folks for being upset if it looks like GS is trying to do and end-around on the process.
210	Yes - let's send it and get an opportunity to participate in offering the products.
210	Mark
211	Any seats left for the sushi demo?
211	If so, I'd like to attend.
212	Looks good to me.
213	Hey Buck - How've you been?
213	I assume business has been good since I haven't heard from you lately.
213	Don't forget to send me a bill for the work you did on the boat last month......
213	Mark
214	Ken: I thought you might be interested in the attachment.
214	Mark
215	Those should be paid like his regular expenses.
215	Please let me know if someone raises an objection.
215	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
216	No problem.
217	Yes, I think that's how it's supposed to be.
217	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
218	I approved an access request for this that came through yesterday.
218	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
219	FYI: One of our legal consultants has mentioned that another of his clients is setting up an internet derivatives trading system.
219	They are using an outfit called Intuitive Products International based in New York and London to assist with system design.
219	Tana Jones (x33399) will be setting up a demo by these folks with our legal department needs in mind - if you'd like to attend, we'd be happy to have you and ask them to expand their presentation to include internet trading.
220	I'm looking for an article that appeared on page 12 of the May 17 issue of Investment Dealers' Digest entitled "CFTC contacts Blackbird, which reignites debate."
220	Mark Taylor
221	Does the proposed reorg now contemplate that a US entity will act as principal for financial transactions?
222	Christian, I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada.
222	The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.
222	The Armada was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the English Channel.
222	Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.
222	Of course, the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's when Nelson "broke the enemy line" at the battle of Trafalgar.
222	I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.
222	The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.
222	I'm pretty sure it's somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish.
222	Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?
222	The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.
222	As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the "Risk Management Policy."
222	It most definitely covers Portland trading operations.
222	I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.
222	Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.
222	I don't have a current version but will ask Ted for one.
222	Mark
223	FYI: Alex Mashinsky of ARBINET will be speaking on "Commoditising Telecoms: The Development of a Spot Market for International Telecoms Trading" at
224	I will be in New York on June 17 & 18.
225	Regarding Louise's second paragraph, I guess I had always assumed there would be different governing law provisions at a minimum - and dispute resolution fits similarly - with parties in various jurisdictions.
225	Any thoughts?
226	Just a thought: I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if there are master agreements in place, the credit provisions contained in them would apply to on-line trades.
226	The availability of the on-line system may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.
227	Here is another services agreement - this one used as a form by EES.
228	I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along asap.
229	Justin, I note that the ETA has been revised to include a paragraph which provides that Enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation.
229	Is that how we want this to work?
229	In the telephone trading context we assume that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation, even when we have a recording of the conversation.
229	Mark
230	Sorry - I'll be in NYC that weekend and I believe that's T's big swim meet in Atlanta.
230	But thanks for the offer!
231	I'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or not - can't wait to hear the details Yes, it was a fun weekend - we were in Austin.
231	T. swimming at the Lake and I stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage.
231	Good food, too.
231	The only downer was the drive.
232	Our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling conflicts.
232	Please make every effort to reserve this time slot (first and third Wednesdays at 10:00) in the future for our group meetings.
233	Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms - including the Omnibus Annex A. Please give some thought to whether there are any other revisions we should make at this time.
233	We make every effort to minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many necessary changes made at this time as possible.
233	Mark
234	I currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.
234	Please let me know if this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me.
234	If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.
234	Thanks and please charge 413/1157.
234	Mark Taylor
235	The current versions are all the way at the bottom.
236	Here is the current version.
236	The numbers on the Annex have been deleted.
237	Hey Tim - Thanks for the note - I needed a smile today.
237	I've been extremely busy and am leaving this afternoon for another trip to our London office.
237	Were you able to make any headway with the Bank regarding the NY house?
237	I just wondered if Greg had been able to help at all.
237	Mark
238	One more try......
239	One more try......
240	Hi Marc - I just got back from London last night.
240	Looks like our IT people found out about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming that was to install a new virus shield.
240	Didn't affect me since I wasn't here anyway.
240	How've you been?
241	Has Louise mentioned anything about this to you?
241	What are we supposed to do with it?
242	We're home this weekend - might go sailing (you're welcome to come if you want) but nothing big planned.
242	I'm in NYC next Wed - Sun., T's in a swim meet in Atlanta next weekend, NYC after that.
242	Nothing planned for the 26/27 weekend & still toying with the idea of Seattle for the 4th.
243	Here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use.
243	Let me know if this is even close to what you have in mind.
243	I can have one of our paralegals and our graphics dept.
243	fill in whatever we need and make it look good tomorrow.
243	Mark
244	Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for purely financial transactions - swaps and options.
244	There are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here.
244	To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.
244	I'm not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I suspect you need.
244	If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.
244	When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity.
244	I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms.
244	In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).
244	If your situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic changes to these forms might be in order. With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don't even use forms as such. I will ask Julia Murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions. Unfortunately, I don't know of an electronic table of contents to the forms. There is a project underway to create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.
245	I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.
245	If not, would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?
246	I've been working the whole time - no vacation or sick time to report.
247	Here's a revised draft.
248	Alison: Kevin & I are putting the final touches on our presentation - will we be able to have a projector for a computer/powerpoint presentation?
248	Mark
249	Yes, we would like to use the PowerPoint presentation.
249	Sorry for the last minute request.
249	If it's a big problem, I might be able to get our graphics dept.
249	to turn it into 35mm slides.
249	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
250	I have my Wine Country book here at the office today but don't know where to send it - if you're in Houston I can have a messenger bring it to you.
250	Mark
251	Here are the powerpoint slides for our presentation tomorrow.
251	Kevin should be sending you some additional pages that are not part of the slides but that we would like to hand out.
251	See you tomorrow!
251	Mark
252	Sylvia: I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk about this today.
252	I'm a little worried about who is handling the Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.
252	Fred Lagrasta is now also supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know if he needs any audio/visual equipment).
252	Can you check on this - maybe somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office will know where this is supposed to take place?
252	It is entirely possible that no one has reserved a room yet.
252	If you could do that and then let the attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.
252	Unfortunately, I'm on my way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.
252	Thanks for your help!
252	Mark T.
253	Jeff: In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for information including a bullet point list of our key issues and any appropriate background material.
253	I have prepared a draft issues list which is attached.
253	Would you please take a quick look at it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it on to Mark?
253	He probably also needs the final itineraries.
253	Thanks for your help.
253	Mark T.
254	I hope ours looks better than this:
255	sorry about that - misdirected to you.
256	could you please look into this?
257	I can certainly be available for a portion of that time - can you tell me the purpose of the call?
258	I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange Act issues.
259	Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form.
259	She will have comments for us by Monday morning, Houston time.
260	You might find the attached of interest.
260	I fear it is time to consider the S&C memorandum we discussed at our first meeting in New York.
261	There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk the necessary language.
261	This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the internet trading language in the confirm they generate?
262	I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are different.
263	Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc options might be a problem.
263	However, if the customer is not a US entity, the advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there would be a problem.
264	Looks good to me!
265	I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way.
265	Maybe if you can give me a little more detail I could help.
266	Ken: I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa project.
266	Of course, I have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.
266	In any event, if it is my time, it is clearly there in error.
266	Is there any detail describing what I am supposed to have done during those hours?
266	That might help me redirect the errant time to where it belongs.
266	There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at Enron.
266	He worked for EI and was based in London.
266	Any chance this is his time?
266	Mark
267	Have a good time!
268	No problem - I'm glad we go it straightened out.
268	Do you do any work with Yao Apasu in Legal?
268	Yao & I go way back.
269	FYI
270	Please take a few minutes to select your reviewers for the mid-year performance review process and enter them in the Performance Management System so that we can move this process along.
270	Thanks!
270	Mark
271	We are trying to decide what to do this weekend and wondered (with fond memories of last year in mind) what you guys had planned.....
272	I would be interested in your thoughts.
273	We think the HoustonStreet disclaimer is not just overkill but entirely unnecessary.
273	And I plan to remind all of you of this the next time you claim the Enron lawyers are too conservative!
274	I have canceled my earlier plans so I have a lot of flexibility now.
274	If my preference enters into the equation, I would say 2 or 6 August would be perfect (I could tack a holiday on to one end or the other) but I recognize that may be too late.
275	I don't think we should take this at face value - company the size of Sunoco should be able to use an ISDA.
276	Looks good to me.
277	I'm not sure if this document was one of the ones we sent to you earlier but it may be useful to have around.
278	I'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not.
278	Lousie seems to think that you are preparing the U.S. version of this.
279	Don't worry about the delay - if you want to wait til later next week that's fine by me.
280	I had the pre-review meeting on my calendar for the 16th (10:00) and the final meeting for the 30th (1:30).
280	Has one of them changed?
280	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
281	Swiss Atel Starts Electricity Derivative Trading Co Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Aare-Tessin AG (Z.AAR), the Swiss power company known as Atel, said Thursday that it has set up a company for derivatives trading.
281	Atel said it's launching the new company, derivAtel, amid the deregulation of Europe's electricity markets.
281	"In this manner the market position of Atel will be strengthened," Atel said in a press release.
281	The company will offer derivatives to hedge volatile electricity prices.
281	Atel said it received permission for derivative trading from the Federal Banking Commission on July (END) Dow Jones Newswires 08-07-99
282	All Delaware corporations are registered with the Secretary of State's office in Wilmington, Delaware.
282	Since that office is notoriously slow, if your counterparty is trying to get information on ECTRIC they might have better luck going through CT Corporation Systems, a company that is in the business of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the Delaware state records.
282	They have offices all over the place, including Wilmington.
282	Hope this is helpful.
282	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe
283	My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for David Portz.
283	He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my supervision and I didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today.
284	Looks good to me.
285	It turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be inundated with information over the next day or so.
285	Let me know if the message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to decipher.
285	Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London.
285	Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.
285	Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London team to discuss scheduling.
285	I'll let you know as soon as I have anything more to report on the calendar.
285	Mark
286	From the NYT article: The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains untested.
286	But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity.
286	He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, earned an M.B.A. and set up a natural-gas trading operation -- competing against Enron -- for British Petroleum.
286	He also did a stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank.
287	Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.
287	They were sent to Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as necessary to solve issues you may raise.
287	The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us before a password is issued.
287	The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before trading is permitted.
287	The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).
288	This is the e-mail I mentioned yesterday.
288	It is not exactly what had been described to me and I do have concerns with it.
288	My preference would be to limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask (as opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us).
288	I understand that London legal was doing some tinkering with the language but I haven't seen anything from them yet.
288	Let's discuss.
289	I will be handling the derivatives side of the ETOL transaction this time so future communications should probably come to me directly.
289	I will be reviewing the ISDA draft this weekend and it would be helpful if I could get some sort of description of the overall transaction.
289	Is there a term sheet or executive summary of the deal?
289	If so, my fax # is (713)646-3490.
290	Thanks for your note.
290	Yes, I am available for the call and have asked Sullivan & Cromwell to have someone available as well.
290	As soon as the time is firm, I will be able to let you know who at S&C to call.
291	Unfortunately, I already have a meeting from 11 to 1 Houston time.
291	I'm free from 9:45 to 11 and then after 1.
292	Marc: I want to go but T doesn't (the photo of the cast not up to T's high standards) so I'm afraid we won't be joining you.
292	Thanks for the invite - maybe dinner or drinks after or Sat.?
293	That sounds like fun - what did you do last month?
294	Any preference?
295	This looks a lot better to me.
295	What do you guys think?
296	Sorry - I got the address wrong yesterday.
297	I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the "green book" and my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the Independent Amount).
297	The theory there is that as the market moves against us, we are cushioned by our "out-of-the-moneyness" and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money.
297	I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.
297	We need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the paralegals can suggest something?).
297	I suggest we add the following language (taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far we go out of the money: "Credit Support Amount" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts.
297	I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of alternatives for Paragraph 13.
298	FYI
299	Dan, Thanks for the drafts.
299	I believe our only comment comes from our confirmation desk that the Commodity Reference Price in Enron3.doc should be "OIL - WTI - NYMEX".
299	Give me a call (713-853-7459) if you have any questions.
299	Mark Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
300	I don't have a problem with Brent being our primary contact there.
301	One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to Heaven.
301	There he meets the Lord himself.
301	The Lord says to the cat, "You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your stay in Heaven more comfortable, please let Me know."
301	The cat thinks for a moment and says, "Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."
301	The Lord stops the cat and says, "Say no more," and a wonderful fluffy pillow appears.
301	A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to Heaven.
301	Again the Lord is there to greet them with the same offer.
301	The mice answer, "All of our lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of running. Do you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?"
301	The Lord says, "Say no more," and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates.
301	About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep sleep on the pillow.
301	The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing.
301	The cat replies better than I could have ever expected.
301	And those Meals on Wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best!!!"
302	Here is the draft form for the US derivatives GTC.
303	I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.
303	Obviously, this is the UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.
303	The US version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.
303	We're also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be different from the UK version.
303	Speaking of which, I was surprised to find that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.
303	What's the practice in your part of the world?
303	One alternative is to insert the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed acceptance.
303	Would that work for your deals?
303	Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.
303	Louise is insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.
303	I'll be calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made to the ETA if necessary.
304	Taffy - the airline called to say I have to leave a day earlier on my vacation (isn't that too bad).
304	Could you please add Friday the 27th of August to my vacation on the calendar.
305	Have you heard anything about this?
305	I can't get into this on the internet from here but will certainly check into it when I get back.
306	I particularly like the grand prize winner.
307	sorry - sent that last one by mistake
308	Here are the most recent versions of the US documents.
309	Here is a revised version of my draft GTC's for derivatives transactions (I think marked from the draft I left with you).
309	Any comments or suggestions?
309	I've promised these to Louise by Friday.
309	Thanks, Mark
310	Thanks Harry - yours are the first North American GTC's in!
311	Louise Kitchen will be in my office (EB3889) this afternoon at around 3:00 to answer any last minute questions you may have in preparing your online GTC's.
311	Mark
312	Are we inviting London?
313	My apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday.
313	While the GTC's must be finished this morning, Legal's revisions to the short and long descriptions are not due until Friday August 6.
313	I think it would make sense for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week.
313	I will ask Taffy to set something up.
313	Mark
314	Here are my revised versions - I look forward to your comments.
315	Here are the contract forms which I delivered in hardcopy this afternoon.
316	Louise, I hope you had a pleasant weekend in N.O.
316	If you have a few minutes to spare, I'd like to get together with you this afternoon to talk about the weather deal documentation.
316	As I tried to draft up the standard GTC's I realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently listed in the short & long description lists.
316	Mark
317	I will be there.
318	FYI
319	Can you handle this?
320	FYI
321	Here is the spreadsheet which lists all of the existing counterparties proposed to receive access to the online trading system.
321	Louise has asked us to identify for each counterparty those products from which, for legal reasons, such counterparty should be restricted.
321	As you might expect, our goal is to have as few restrictions as possible.
321	Since it is so wide, you may find that it is easier to modify the spreadsheet (by hiding various columns) in order to print it out.
321	If you need any help in this regard, please let me know.
322	I understand that you may be in the Houston office at some point this week.
322	If so, I would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about South American Legal staffing issues.
322	Could you give me a call (713-853-7459) or drop me an e-mail with what might work for you?
322	If you are not actually in the office but have some time to talk on the phone, that would work too.
322	Thanks, Mark
323	As yourequested.
324	Digital Frontiers Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid American Banker Page 12 Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
324	A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not all, of their business in cyberspace.
324	The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage contracts that are digitally signed.
324	Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most require customers to enroll and order account transfers by sending in paper documents.
324	The law makes such paperwork no longer necessary.
324	Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds customer identities to documents-are seen as a way to "legalize" on-line exchanges of information.
324	The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into law last week, "gives people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable," said Thomas J. Smedinghoff, a partner in the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on digital signatures.
324	He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature could limit the flexibility of its application as the technology evolves.
324	Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important to securities brokers, because securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise transactions on the Internet, said Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass. E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the California bill, bringing the issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose.
324	Sen. Vasconcellos introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.
324	San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, also offered input on the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' chief of staff, Rand Martin.
324	Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, however, a spokesman for the company said.
324	"This action is a step in the right direction," the spokesman said.
324	"But the real objective would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the use of digital signatures."
324	E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its transactions with customers in all 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California is "murky."
324	E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law applying across the country.
324	Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic commerce division, said the only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated that a contract was governed by the laws of California.
324	Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state.
324	For example, Connecticut law covers only medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures applicable to all communications.
324	In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature legislation, but that legislation was limited to communication with government agencies.
324	Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a comprehensive law that preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of Digital Signature Trust Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.
324	To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) this year introduced two bills addressing the issue.
324	The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to clarify the legal status of electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities Transaction Act focuses on the securities industry.

325	Alan Aronowitz's group is handling actual bandwidth.
325	If it ever becomes financially traded, we will treat it like any other derivative.
326	I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.
326	I'll bring along some sailing info.
326	but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.
326	Dan & Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of us.
326	We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.
326	We'd fly down there on Saturday the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th or Sunday the 28th.
326	[The return date is still under discussion - so far we have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the question said "Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South Beach!"] The charter company is the Moorings (their website is www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings 463.
326	You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.
326	Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe not.
326	Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.
326	Most days we only actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00 and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks, etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or whatever (my favorite).
326	There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal proclivity for the duration of the trip.
326	If you scuba dive there are dive companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.
326	If you want to learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving, Ted & I probably won't).
326	Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail hour for me.
326	There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board if we don' feel like going ashore.
326	While no one is excluded from any activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't always do everything together, either.
326	Everybody usually pitches in and shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't be expected to cook.
326	In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.
326	As for $, the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night we get there all comes to about $760 per person.
326	Extras include drinks (only fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.
326	I've tentatively got flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person, though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.
326	Ted & I usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're not always successful.
326	It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved until we do.
326	I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!
326	Check out the website & let me know if you have any questions.
327	Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are just guessing and they get you instead.
327	I'd appreciate it if you could forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number going forward.
327	Mark
328	Let's add this as an agenda item to discuss when Sara and I are there.
329	Just to give you an idea of the kinds of things Brent and Andrea are working on.
330	Please do a card for my rolodex.
330	Thanks
331	Marcus: When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.
331	I'm flying into Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.
331	If you are going to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever suggestions you would like to make.
331	If you will be out next week, maybe we could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.
331	Thanks!
331	Mark
332	I spoke with Bill about this and he agreed it was a good idea.
333	In order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online trading system I need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do not have all the necessary representations (e.g. trade option exemption) and definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives.
333	Friday noon would be soon enough.
333	Thanks, Mark
334	This might be good for you to go to.
335	Please print this out for me.
336	Laurel: Apologies for my delay in responding to you.
336	Carol St. Clair is helping me with this transaction now.
336	She will get back to you on the confirms.
336	Please copy her on future e-mails.
336	Mark
337	If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, it's just possible you haven't fully grasped the situation.
338	I'm off to London tomorrow (after a stopover day in NYC and back next Wed.) but T will be around all weekend.
338	Are you guys here or traveling again?
339	I will not be available for the call on Friday.
340	I like to leave for London at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary so I have a day to get adjusted to the time change - otherwise you get off the plane and go straight to the office (with a shower on the way if you're lucky) and I'm exhausted at that point.
340	I don't ever sleep well on the plane.
340	This time I'm leaving on Friday afternoon to stop in NY for a party Friday night and then leaving for London from there on Sat.
340	night.
340	Since the company pays for business class, there's no savings for going over the weekend.
340	I could get a free companion ticket for T but he's never been able to get off work at the same time I have to go.
340	The rest of our August is a bit hectic, too.
340	Next weekend T has a swim meet in San Francisco and I leave that Mon.
340	night to spend the rest of the week in S. America.
340	The following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to Laguna Beach but I think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so I can catch my breath.
340	We leave on our big trip to Europe (Germany, Belgium & the Netherlands) on the 26th and don't get home til 9/12.
340	I have to pack tonight so I think we'll pass on the film.
340	I hope we get a chance to get together some time in the next few weeks - maybe a weeknight dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full?
341	It strikes me that it would be appropriate to offer this service without the application fee and deposit to Platinum Elite members and Presidents Club members.
341	If not, the fact that ANY spaces are being removed from the already inadequate supply will only infuriate me, not make me happy.
341	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
342	Thanks for the update - I can't say I'm too sorry about any delay since I haven't had a spare moment to look at them yet anyway.
342	This project moves so fast and there's so much to do it's scary!
343	Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not contain the necessary elements for trding energy commodity derivatives?
343	In particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.
344	Thanks Marcus - I'll give you a call when I'm in London next week.
345	Unfortunately, you have the wrong e-mail address for me.
345	My correct address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.
346	I'm headed to South America next week.
346	Any particular issues you think I need to be aware of or anything you want me to look into?
347	Cindy - I won't be able to make the 8/17 meeting.
347	I will be at the 8/25 meeting.
347	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
348	Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.
348	He actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less).
348	Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual legal risk.
348	He seemed satisfied enough with the format.
348	I explained that I had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many jurisdictions to deal with.
349	The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put together.
349	Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on next Wednesday (August 18th).
349	Since I will be out of town then, please forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.
349	Questions can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on the online trading team.
350	Please note that my correct e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.
351	I understand that there may be a few additional changes but these are the revisions from our meeting on Monday.
352	Mark H. has asked me to let him know exactly what we will be sending out on 9/13.
352	Would it be accurate to say it will be no more than a flashy brochure with the recently circulated content together with a blank password application all in a very exciting package of some kind?
353	I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo.
353	I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.
353	Any chance you will be nearby?
353	I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo then.
353	I also still get to London every once in a while.
353	Let me know when you are there - maybe we can have dinner.
353	Mark
354	Here are my draftversions of the weather GTC's.
354	Since Enron North America will be the Enron contracting entity for all of the transactions, I have expanded the documents to allow for European as well as U.S. transactions and to allow for multiple weather station (index) deals or single weather station deals.
354	The option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be specified on the web site.
354	I think it would make sense for one of the weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they agree that they work.
354	I'm hoping to sit down with Mark Dilworth in the morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete - when you look at these forms, it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on the web site: Premium, Effective Date, Termination Date, Reference Weather Station(s), Fallback Reference Weather Station(s), Reference Basis, Reference Degrees (C or F), Strike Amount, Notional Amount and Maximum Payout Limit are the terms I have identified so far.
354	Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!
354	There are blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate agencies are.
354	I have not spelled out the data sources for the European transactions either.
354	Mark
355	Mark - Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?
355	I have quite a few comments on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.
355	I am particularly concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for all financial products (the Index tab).
355	If you could let me or my assistant know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).
355	Unfortunately I'm leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.
355	I'm at x37459.
355	Thanks!
355	Mark p.s.
355	- It might make sense to have somebody from the Confirmation Desk come too - what do you think?
356	Here is the spreadsheet with my comments to date.
357	The letter looks fine to me (one typo on the last page where the "O" in EnronOnline is not capitalized).
358	I have suggested that Mark Dilworth, one of the guys responsible for the web site development, schedule some time with each of you to discuss the latest Long Descriptions spreadsheet.
358	He can walk you through exactly how it works for your commodities so you can make informed comments.
359	The addition of Paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra modifications I had not anticipated.
359	Once you get the info why don't you take a crack at making the necessary changes & let me know.
359	It may be pretty obvious but I think I can walk you through it on the phone if it's not.
360	Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre.
360	Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird (A true story from Associated Press, by Kurt Westervelt) Stick with this.....it's worth it!
360	This is the strangest thing I've ever heard.
360	The series of events that had to have taken place in order for this to happen are astounding!
360	At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death: On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head.
360	Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.
360	He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency.
360	As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly.
360	Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he planned.
360	"Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "A person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as committing suicide.
360	That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.
360	The room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife.
360	They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun.
360	The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus as he passed by outside.
360	When someone, intending to kill person "A," kills person "B" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.
360	When confronted with a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded.
360	The old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.
360	He had no intention to murder her.
360	Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.
360	The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.
360	It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother.
360	The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.
360	Now comes the final twist!
360	Further investigation revealed that the couple's son was in fact, Ronald Opus.
360	He had become increasingly despondent over his failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.
360	This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun blast passing through the ninth floor window.
360	The son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a suicide.
361	I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.
361	When a traveller is placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.
361	If you wait for the provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the person on the phone before anyone on the list.
361	Other agents have done this for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.
362	Tana - please send a copy of the Stikeman memo to Peter Keohane.
362	Thanks!
362	Mark
363	Sorry Paige - I was in South America last week - will respond today.
364	Sorry for not getting back to you sooner (I was out of town last weeek) - unfortunately, I have a 2:00 already on my calendar but am available later.
364	If you want to meet with Alan & Jeff first and see me afterwards, that's ok with me.
365	Any objection to having David Gilberg fill in for me on this?
366	I'll be on vacation then - see you in September!
367	I see what you mean, and I can't explain the bcc - unfortunately, unless they use "mtaylo1@ect.enron.com" it doesn't get here.
367	It must just disappear into cyberspace.
367	Thanks for continuing to send them on.
367	Mark
368	Please note that my e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.
368	If you use mtaylor it goes to someone else and may or may not get forwarded to me later.
369	Paige - I can be more argumentative here but if it's not going to make any difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.
369	Let me know if you disagree.
369	While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment which may be payable to the defaulting party.
369	An event of default and resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, etc.).
370	Mark - It looks like the new version (that I received from Andrew last week) does not contain the comments I had already made.
370	Have those been lost somewhere?
371	Marie - would you please check with Credit and see if you can help with this issue.
371	Thanks, Mark
372	The October days are fine with me.
372	I will be out that week in November so I'd appreciate it if you could coordinate with Sara and Shari to make sure we'll have adequate coverage.
373	Yes but gtc's not confirmed as complete set and long descriptions not yet reviewed.
374	Mike - In a word - no.
374	We'll add it in and you don't need to worry.
374	Mark
375	Could you please send Tana the list of countries from which online trading of derivatives with ECT is permissible.
375	She is trying to complete the Counterparty spreadsheet for Louise.
375	Thanks!
375	Mark
376	Looks good to me.
377	Do you want to set up a time to meet tomorrow?
377	How does 10 a.m. look for you?
378	Fiona - Welcome to the Legal Dept.!
378	I think Taffy was coordinating with you regarding my dinner with Mark this week, Unfortunately, my trip was canceled at the very last minute this afternoon.
378	Mark is already aware of the change but he may now have an open slot for dinner on Wed.
378	I'm sorry I won't be able to meet you this week but will look forward to it on my next trip over.
378	Mark
379	I'm in EB3889.
380	Hey Dave!
380	Thanks for your note.
380	Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."
380	And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.
380	We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.
380	He and I are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.
380	The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.
380	Harry Collins is the emissions guy.
380	I'm assuming he'll be part of this process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.
380	Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.
380	My plan is to ask the lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for which they are responsible.
380	With me here to answer questions that may result in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.
380	I hope to be able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.
380	Maybe you can help me prioritize: should I look first at areas with predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the quality of work to date?
380	Talk to you soon.
380	Mark
381	Thanks for the itinerary.
381	Please note that my e-mail address begins with mtaylo1, not mtaylor (which goes to Mitch Taylor).
382	Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning (11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.
382	The system now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by counterparties online.
382	It is particularly important that the lawyers responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can complete the review process.
382	If you can not attend, please let me know so we can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.
382	Thanks, Mark
383	Dave: One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the confirm desk.
383	My inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous contract.
383	Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal text could wait for the paper confirm.
383	Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal language.
383	Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make sense to give you my version as well.
383	What are your thoughts?
383	If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00 tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.
383	Mark
384	It may be that you don't need to be there at all.
384	This relates to the online trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of the system.
384	If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the commodities you handle.
384	The project is only confidential in that we're trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.
384	There's no problem talking about it internally.
384	You're certainly welcome to attend if you want to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already covering things, you don't need to worry about it.
384	Mark
385	Dave - could you please give me a call about this - I think it would be easier to explain over the phone.
385	I have an interview scheduled at 9:30 but am at your disposal after that.
385	Mark
386	Just a 'heads up' - there is now no doubt that there will need to be some major revisions to the index language.
386	I am meeting with some of the folks from the confirm desks this afternoon to get them started on a further review.
386	Can you please arrange to have the following people given access to the Product Manager: Jeff Sorenson Dale Neuner Bob Bowen Lynn Shivers Kevin Sweeney
387	FYI
388	Here's my revised version - let me know what you think.
389	Frank - I think Harry Collins is tracking this down.
389	If it isn't settled to your satisfaction by Thursday, please let me know.
389	Mark
390	FYI
391	I'll be there.
392	Thanks for your note.
392	If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just remembering my trip and have the following observations: I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.
392	Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular (that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by boat.
392	I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a pretty good view.
392	There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.
392	I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down the hill on a bicycle.
392	There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my first-ever snorkeling.
392	It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a lot of pretty coral).
392	I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look didn't indicate they have a visitors center.
392	You might call them when you are there if you have the extra time and want to go.
392	As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them yourselves, why not take them all!
392	Have a great trip!
392	Love, Mark
393	The language works for me as long as the long description describes multi-month options as a series of multiple options.
394	test message
395	I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.
395	Have we decided that French counterparties are ok?
396	Looks ok to me.
397	Non-smoking please.
398	I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference issues.
399	Give me a call with any questions.
400	If Debbie is talking about the language she and I discussed late last week, that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the GTC's.
401	I found it!
402	My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the contract will be enforceable.
402	It is certainly not necessary from my point of view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks much better.
402	It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the "agree" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through.
402	I personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on "agree" as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.
402	David - do you agree?
403	Same treatment as for telephone trading.
403	Enron North America Corp.
404	The 15th looks fine.
404	The 23rd and 24th are already holidays.
404	As for the 22nd, please coordinate with the other legal assistants to make sure we will have coverage that week.
405	In this case I would say do whatever is easiest for you guys.
405	Since we know that Enron Canada is qualified, we don't really have to have the representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception, it doesn't hurt to have it in.
406	FYI
407	Hey Marc - I'm here - it's actually nice to be home & not traveling for a while.
407	Will you guys be around this weekend?
407	It doesn't look like I can help your friend.
407	We almost never hire lawyers fresh out of law school.
407	Believe it or not, they don't really teach you how to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step.
407	Your first job is where your real training takes place.
407	We just don't have the time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have worked for a number of years (usually at least 5 or 6) at a good law firm.
407	They get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it.
408	Tanya wants us to use this credit for the 5 deemed ISDA's for AIG that Lucy is working on.
409	Can you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to local counsel in Europe relating to the online trading project?
409	Alan needs it for Australia and Louise has asked me to deal with Columbia.
409	Thanks, Mark
410	I have marked my revisions below.
411	Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online system.
411	I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.
411	They do have the advantage of being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.
411	I don't think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest material.
411	The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.
411	The first time the counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.
411	The GTC's are the contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master agreement in place.
411	Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.
411	While most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our "Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed ISDA."
411	One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call for collateral if we choose.
412	Maybe you can just respond to this?
413	Here is my first cut at an Issues List for Wednesday.
413	Let me know what you think.
413	My meeting with Mark H. has been moved up to 1:00.
413	He may want to get you on the phone then but I don't really know.
414	My only concern is knowing which way the Inside FERC price adjustment that is submitted will go - will it always be plus or always minus?
414	If so, let's say so.
414	If not, how will it be clear on the web site which direction the adjustment is going?
415	Was there supposed to be an attachment to the e-mail or are these coming
416	I would suggest changing "attain" to "obtain."
417	EPMI and RMT are two different corporations.
417	As I understand it, in North America EPMI enters into only physical power transactions with third parties while ENA enters into financial transactions.
417	RMT handles financial transactions between wholly-owned Enron companies.
417	If the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ENA and Australia, it should be documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and the other between RMT and Australia.
417	That's why the master agreement is between RMT and Australia.
417	I don't know how the booking is handled.
418	The same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing all the derivatives through RMT.
419	Fred called & asked if we could move our lunch from Monday to Thursday or Friday.
419	Does Thursday work for you?
420	Stephanie: Sorry I didn't see your response until today.
420	The prior tenant is moving out today so the house will be available as soon as I can get it cleaned up and any necessary repairs made.
420	Let me know if you'd like to see it.
420	Mark
421	Something must have happened in the transmission process - I can't make anything out of the info below.
422	You can ignore that last e-mail.
423	We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions" online.
423	If we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will be approved.
423	It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval.
423	The due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel.
423	We usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense.
423	FYI, the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.
423	A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.
424	Looks good to me.
424	Are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post daily volumes?
425	Looks good to me.
426	Good idea.
426	Enron North America Corp.
427	Thanks for your help last week.
427	Saturday night was a lot of fun!
428	What is the proposed process once Legal receives this kind of request?
429	How does the New Product Type Approval process work?
429	We have received several test messages but it is not clear how we look beyond the short description in the e-mail to see the long description (can the short description be set up as a hyperlink to the web-site?) or how we are supposed to respond (my attempted reply was rejected as undeliverable).
430	I noticed that ISDA is putting on a one-day course in London October 19 on Documenting and Confirming Credit Derivative Transactions.
430	If you are interested and haven't received the brochure, let me know and I can fax it to you.
431	Sorry for the delay - my e-mail has been down all day.
432	We may have some problems with derivatives trading in Mexico - see Tana's note from earlier today.
432	I'll start the process for the ETA & PA.
433	I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time other than December.
433	I guess Monmouth is a little harder to get to than Chicago but it will be nice to see the campus again.
433	I'm going to be in New York Nov. 1 & 2.
433	Any chance of getting together?
433	Mark
434	The difficulty is in knowing which entites are regulated and which are not.
434	For instance, ENA is an "unregulated" affiliate of a regulated utility (PGE).
434	But many utilities have energy services companies affiliates which, while not regulated utilities like San Diego Gas & Electric, are nevertheless heavily regulated.
434	We have tried to figure out what we can in the time available and have relied on readily available public inofrmation.
435	We are getting very excited about the BVI.
435	It's hard to believe it's only 5 weeks away.
435	I try to think about it whenever the stock market gets me depressed (which is happening with altogether too much frequency these days).
435	I see you guys got hit with a triple whammy today.
435	Oh well, can you say "buying opportunity"?
435	I'm coming to NYC for a conference in a couple of weeks - any chance you guys are free for dinner on Sunday the 31st?
435	We also need to talk about $ sometime soon since I made the final payment on the boat a couple of weeks ago.
435	Have you made your hotel arrangements (we still have a room reserved for you for the night of the 20th which you won't need if you've made other arrangements - and we can always get you a room there for the last night if you want)?
435	And there's still the beverage list (you did get my fax, didn't you?).
435	T. sends regards.
435	Hope you're well and not letting the market roller-coaster get you down (my mantra is "think long term, think long term, think long term").
435	Mark
436	Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.
436	Unfortunately, they have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the Enron intranet to get access.
436	If you want to see it badly enough, I might be able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll let you know when they roll it out onto the web.
436	Mark
437	As far as I know, this is the policy for all online trading.
437	Did I miss something?
438	Let's go for dinner Monday night.
438	With any luck I'll be able to get to the airport for a plane back to Houston Tues.
438	night.
439	The people at Derivatives Week assure me that we should have access to their web site (www.derivativesweek.com) by Wednesday.
439	Password: swap
440	Here are my comments.
441	Yes, without doubt.
441	The ETA can't be amended on a counterparty by counterparty basis and it says that any applicable master agreement will control.
441	Leslie Hansen is also working on a draft.
441	If you get something from Justin, please forward a copy to me and Leslie.
441	Thanks, Mark
442	Please arrange - hopefully for Tuesday since Wed.
442	may be hectic.
443	I fully agree with the "fade" effect.
443	But this looks right to me.
443	As I remember it, we were not totally happy with the Notional Quantity language but this was the best we could do.
443	We were going to make sure that whether the submitted volume was per day or per month was clearly reflected elsewhere in the long description.
443	Not elegant, but adequate.
444	Thanks for your reply.
444	I think I'd prefer something that's not hosted if possible.
444	I can definately spend more for something that's either very nice or very interesting.
444	Also prefer to avoid far reaches of upper east or west sides.
445	Thanks for your note.
445	Of the three you have listed, #1643 is probably a bit far from public transport for me.
445	#1671 is convenient to the business I have on Mon.
445	& Tues.
445	(what is Double SS?).
445	#1966 sounds like a fun location.
445	I'd be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or interesting (any loft spaces?).
446	Sounds reasonable to me.
446	I'm afraid the difficult questions are the one you posed to Peter and whether or not Credit will agree.
447	This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).
447	What do you think about Edmund's solution?
447	Mark
448	Would you be available to take Andrea Calo to dinner next Wednesday (the night before the Legal Conference)?
448	She is coming in a day early to meet & chat with people here.
449	Would you like me to set up some meetings for you with people here in the Houston office for the day before the Confernce?
449	If so, please let me know what your schedule is & I will ask my assistant to set up some times for you.
450	I had a voice mail from him Mon or Tues that said he would try and get into the office either today or tomorrow.
450	I expect he may be tied up with getting his son into the hospital and catching up with his wife so we may not see him til Monday.
451	I feel confident putting myself in your hands.
451	As long is it's not stratospheric, I should be able to get Enron to pick up the tab.
451	Please go ahead and book whatever you think would be good.
451	Just let me know when & where to go!
452	There is no organized transport to the Woodlands but it will be easy to make arrangements for you to ride with someone else leaving from the office - so I guess it makes sense for you to come in Thursday morning as well.
452	I'll try and set up a few meetings for you starting with lunch on Wednesday.
452	I was thinking primarily of lawyers here - anyone in particular you would like on the list?
453	Jeff, Alan & I will all be in a meeting at 10.
454	Would you please try and arrange for 30 min.
454	meetings for Andrea Calo with as many of the following people as possible either Wednesday afternoon (from 2:00 to 6:00) or Thursday morning (from 9:00 to 10:30): Mark Haedicke Jeff Hodge Dan Hyvl Michelle Blaine Rob Walls Scott Neal Pat Cini Elizabeth Sager Stacy Dickson Clement Abrams
455	I was planning to take her to lunch that day - you should feel free to take whoever you want.
456	As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force covering a particular transaction, the master controls.
456	I don't think we ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.
456	For example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.
456	However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that way.
456	They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless of what master agreements are in place.
456	To resolve this I suggest that the long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the ETA be revised as follows: revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product "...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of the execution of such Transaction..."
456	(underlined text inserted) I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the legal side?
457	I'm afraid I may never have called you back on this one - do we still need to discuss?
458	My apologies but I'm afraid this one slipped through the cracks in my e-mail and I never responded - has this issue been addressed?
459	Did you ever hear back from the power people?
460	Please deliver my copies to the office.
460	Enron Capital Management
461	Here is Sullivan & Cromwell's reply.
462	Looks good to me.
462	Taffy: Please put these on the calendar.
463	Transacting Question 4 - last line "accepted or rejected immediately upon receipt by the EnronOnline system" or "accepted or rejected by the EnronOnline system immediately upon receipt."
463	Question 5 - similar comment - build in concept of processing immediately upon receipt by the system.
463	Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can traders within a company view each other's transactions if the Master User authorizes it?
463	If so, deleat Back Office User and substitute "and others authorized by your Master User".
463	If not, is it possible there will be more than one Back Office User?
463	I so, insert (s).
463	Products Question 6 - last line "at the best price available on the EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)" Registration Question 13 - still needs an answer.
463	Should it also apply to trader user ID's & passwords?
463	Legal Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement; "framework for transactions carried out" Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?
463	If so, we should have a Corp. lawyer look these over (SEC concerns).
463	These seem more appropriate as answers for PR and IR to have ready in case anyone asks.
463	You will no doubt recognize that I have exercised the utmost restraint - contrary to my every lawerly instinct - in commenting only on provisions that were identified as current changes.
464	What was this one about?
465	Plese print these out for the CFTC file.
466	I'm most concerned about the internet aspect of things now - this is new advice we are requesting and I would not expect it to be the lion's share of the expense - presumably the update portion will be relatively easy.
466	Enron North America Corp.
467	Thanks for taking care of that.
467	I'm glad the Moorings was able to accomodate us.
467	Will you guys be free to get together Sunday eve.?
468	Was your "Yes" an answer to my question or Bruce's?
468	I hope it was mine - any particular preferences/schedule issues?
468	I can bring some sailing stuff for you - cruising guide to the Virgin Islands and a couple of sailing videos if you want.
469	Bummer - thanks for letting me know.
470	Master Agreements will cover trades with that entity only.
470	Enron North America Corp.
471	Don't forget the first session of the Conference begins at 1:00 tomorrow afternoon.
471	Attire for the entire event is casual but since the room may be cool and we hope to have dinner outside, you may want a sweater or jacket.
472	These master agreements will work for any North American financial product.
473	Thanks for spelling it out for me.
473	I WILL be in NYC this weekend and, while I have done it before and found it to be all you describe, would enjoy going to the parade with you.
473	As I remember it, the trick to limiting the aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to be there.
473	The embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants (or at least not acknowledging them as they pass).
473	Do you have the time and route?
473	Maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby.
473	As far as getting in the mood goes, try (I should know how to make that a link but I don't).
473	I'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if I can find it.
473	None of the videos I have is right on point (either the wrong size boat is involved or they're too advanced) but I'll bring them along anyway.
473	I have mixed feelings about bringing Heavy Weather Sailing - I don't want to unnecessarily alarm anyone but we do want G to go to the doctor for the
474	Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner - was out on Thurs & Fri.
474	I'm here and at the Waldorf 355-3000 room 1151.
474	Still have time for that quick drink?
475	Agreed.
476	I'm afraid I'm still the right guy.
476	My comments below in red.
477	Lucy: Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties.
477	There are a couple of general rules that apply to "normal" trading circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary (even just a little bit) from "normal."
477	For example, abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading (except as spelled out below).
477	Having said all that, the following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines: 1.
477	If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.
477	Of course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the U.S.).
477	2.
477	If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to the master agreement.
477	If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other rules may apply.
477	3.
477	If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ECT International.
477	Note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is actually "arranged" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT International).
477	If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution.
477	It would be a good idea to consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.
477	These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions.
477	This doesn't determine where within the Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.
477	If we want the risk to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) to get the risk in the right place.
478	Looks good to me.
479	Here are my comments - mostly minor.
480	I don't have anything handy - I suggest you contact Paige Grumulaitis.
481	I sent Dave comments on his last three additions yesterday and on the full version e-mailed to me (10/29) this afternoon.
481	Is the version I looked at the final one or were there subsequent changes to review?
482	keeping my fingers crossed.....
483	"bunnies"?
483	BUNNIES?
484	Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?
484	I know it's possible to fly into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick you up.
484	It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.
484	The timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John before the afternoon of the 22nd.
484	If you're nervous about sailing into the BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.
484	You might check the cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to go/anchor, etc.
485	Looks like this one is for me to review.
485	They will be sending these to all of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to forward these on to whomever is appropriate.
485	We're supposed to get back to them within 24 hours.
486	There appear to have been some changes that were not made in the Canadian Long Descriptions.
486	Dave Forster will be forwarding them to you.
486	Please resend the language once those changes are incorporated.
486	Thanks!
486	Mark
487	Bummer - I had no idea the USVI wasn't considered part of the US - I'm assuming when you say "on the way back in" you mean from the USVI to the mainland since we could try to arrange things to avoid going back to the BVI while you were with us if that made a difference.
487	I don't have any leads on a possible stand-in, but don't really want one either since we've our hearts set on YOU.
487	Hopefully the lawyer can figure out a way to speed things up.
487	As a last resort, maybe we should check with Greg for a replacement since that's who he'll have to bunk with.
487	You have to be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your holiday in pretty close contact with them.
487	It may also be a bit late to find transport to that part of the world; any hope of transferring the ticket in your name to someone else?
488	I have 4 tickets to the Thursday, November 18 Rockets vs. Sacramento Kings game (7:30 start).
488	Section 125, Row G.
489	Donna: My comments are included below.
489	These are just suggestions and you can take them or leave them as you will.
489	Mark
490	Do you have time to compare this opinion to our current form?
490	Justin tells me he started from a form that was a year or more old.
491	I will give you a call to discuss.
491	Mark
492	Francisco & Lou: Here is the reply from Figueroa Sierra.
492	Sorry for the delay in forwarding this on to you.
492	Mark
493	Agricultural product options are not permitted.
494	I think S&C is fine - they are helping us with CFTC issues related to online trading and Energy Desk.com seems somwhat related.
495	Here's the current forecast for Lenny.
495	Shouldn't be a major problem for us but I feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and Thursday.
495	Bruce - we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come through.
495	Are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this?
495	Seems like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow.
495	Anything at all we can do from here?
496	The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel also.
496	They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.
496	They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have to bring the boat back).
496	I'll let you know what happens when I get through to them tomorrow.
496	Mark
497	David - We'r trying to get through to you on the phone but can't get across the Atlantic.
497	Can you try calling us?
497	I'm at 713 - 853-7459 & Jeff is at Thanks
498	David - as to your point 2, we have used the "Deemed ISDA" appraoch for weather derivatives.
498	I see no reason we can't do something similar in Australia for power.
498	I've atached an example (but I'm not sure it is thefinal version).
498	Mark
499	Andrea Calo and Cecilia are not in the system to allow me to add them to your review.
499	Can you ask them to fill out the form and send it on to me (e-mail is fine).
499	The others were in the system and they should be able to fill everything out on their computers.
500	Please see the following note from Sheila Walton.
500	She has asked that the forms be returned to her by November 25th.
500	They can be sent interoffice mail or by e-mail.
500	Thanks, Mark
501	It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or Puerto Rico.
501	We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.
501	We can't get the boat to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).
501	Best bet is to pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruise ships (not fun).
501	There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas to St. John.
501	We won't be there before noon on Monday.
501	I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing here!
502	Bruce - I just had another thought (they come so rarely I feel a need to pass them along as soon as it happens).
502	The Full Moon party we discussed before is on Nov. 23.
502	Unfortunately it is in the BVI.
502	If your lawyer can get the permit by Monday and Fed Ex it to us, we could still get over there (Bomba's Shack is on the western end of Tortola - reasonably close to the USVI).
502	The boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till Sunday at the earliest.
502	Be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him Monday.
502	Mark P.S.
502	- My sympathies on your day at Federal Plaza.
502	My imagination isn't up to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been.
503	Yes - and boats.
503	I wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just barely east of due south of the BVI.
503	They are predicting that it will resume its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.
503	As of the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!
504	You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the south-east of St. Thomas.
504	The Weather channel this morning showed local radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was pretty far away.
504	The real question is what direction will it go from here.
504	If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.
504	If it takes a turn to the north, direct hit.
504	I hadn't hard about the state of emergency but that could be due to rain related damage.
504	Many storm sites available: In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W
505	Interesting damage reports - particularly from St. Croix.
505	I had been looking at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be able to poke around in the USVI.
505	I seem to remember that the Moorings won't let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might want to get special permission.
505	Now I'm not so sure if the place will still be all ahoo when we get there.
505	It might not have been the entire group's cup of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way to and from St. John.
505	My impression is that I might be the only soul on board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a bit rough from storm effects.
505	I'm watching the national Weather Service updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.
505	Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for deliveries there.
505	You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas airport (next day service by 2 pm).
505	I mentioned in a previous note that the main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).
505	Fed Ex - (800) Mark
506	Good News: Lenny weakening - max.
506	winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising Bad News: The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the north & east It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all so small they almost don't show up on the maps.
506	Luckily St. Thomas is to the west and a bit north of Lenny's current position Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th recent forecasted path maps.
507	I just got this update (emphasis added) - these coordinates put the storm just a tad south and a good (but not comfortable) bit east of St. Thomas & Tortola.
507	If it stays on this track, things will only improve in the VI.
508	t-shirts & bathing suits (daytime) polo/surf shirts & shorts (evening wear) beach towel (you may want to wait & buy this down there) boat shoes or sneakers sunglasses (polarized are best) prescription medication sunscreen!
508	books music CDs camera & film snorkel mask & fins (your own will be better than the ones that come with the boat - give us your shoe size if you're not bringing your own) a few zip-lock bags may come in handy for packing wet items waterproof wallet is good to take along some $ if you decide to swim from boat to shore instead of taking dinghy The Moorings should be able to tell you how to get from the USVI to their base on Tortola.
508	It may be either a combination of ferry to West End (aka Soper's Hole) Tortola and then a cab to the base in Road Town or a ferry straight to Road Town.
508	I don't really know.
508	I'm also no help on how often they run or how long they take.
508	If you can be at the Moorings by 11 or 11:30 Sunday morning that would be perfect.
508	Do you have contact info for your hotel in St. Thomas?
509	I have one change to suggest - see attached.
509	Enron North America Corp.
510	I may have a few minor drafting comments but this otherwise looks pretty good to me.
510	What do you think?
511	Test message.
512	I may not understand the question, but Legal does not need to be informed of each ETA that is executed.
513	My only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have more than one master (covering different commodities or transaction types) with the same counterparty.
513	I can imagine a situation where Credit doesn't want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice versa.
513	I mentioned this to Bob and he will watch for situations where Credit is only "turning off" one master in a multiple master setting.
513	We should also be listing each master affected if Credit wants to turn them all off.
514	Is this something you know anything about?
515	That time works fine for me.
515	I am in EB3889.
516	I suggest you insert "with respect to the Transactions" after the word "Counterparty" in the second line of paragraph 1.
516	Otherwise they look great to me.
516	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.
517	From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an "Eligible Swap Participant" (as defined in federal regulations as over a certain size) from trading derivatives.
517	Generally speaking, they don't approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit perspective but that is up to them.
518	Thanks for taking care of this.
518	Sorry I was not reachable.
519	Test reply.
520	Works for me.
521	We have been working on a somewat revised version of the online "override" letter.
521	What do you think?
522	We have an executed master agreement with Engage Energy Canada L.P. which we received signed around the end of August 1999.
523	That's fine with me - we're taking that approach on the "override" letters that override existing master agreements.
524	I'm still concerned about the circularity of the letter indicating that the GTC will control but then the GTC says the master will control....
525	Here are my comments.
525	Do you want to add anything about the reason for this?
525	I don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might soften the letter a bit.
526	This phone number doesn't work - do you have another?
527	These are ok with me if Agency.com has approved.
527	How will PR be handling #3?
528	This is during our meeting with Michael Guerriero.
528	Would you prefer that I cover the ISDA call?
528	Enron North America Corp.
529	Hi Bruce!
529	Ted took his first steps back to solid foods on Monday night.
529	He was so sick when we left you on Saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to Tortola and put him ashore for Saturday night.
529	We made our flight on Sunday and he went to the Dr. on Monday.
529	They think it was probably food poisoning but I don't see why nobody else got it.
529	Greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund.
529	There were a few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet - Ted had a few groceries and a dinner and I paid for the beverage order).
529	I'll get Ted's numbers when I get home tonight and do a tally which I can send tomorrow.
529	Let me know if you think of anything else.
529	When I first get back I usually feel the room swaying when it is small and enclosed (like an interior conference room or the shower).
529	It's a sure sign you were acclimatised to the boat!
530	I'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so I figured I'd send to both.
530	Here is my itinerary for Christmas travel: Friday 12/24 Continental 4126 Leaves Houston 7:55 am Arrives Cincinnati 11:20 am Sunday 12/26 Continentat 4122 Leaves Cincinnati 5:45 pm Arrives Houston 7:25 pm These are Continental Express flights - I don't know if that makes a difference in terminals in Cincinnati or not - it does in Houston.

532	Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth exchange By Corey Grice Staff Writer, CNET News.com The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange.
532	The currency?
532	Bandwidth.
532	A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today opened the doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange.
532	The company first announced its intention to sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May.
532	Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil, natural gas and grain.
532	Enron has taken this concept and given it a telecommunications spin, offering space on high-speed networks to communications carriers.
532	In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs.
532	The exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier-than-expected network traffic.
532	For example, Global Crossing plans to sell capacity on a high-speed fiber optic link between New York and Los Angeles over the exchange.
532	Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next May.
532	Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its own commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New York today.
532	RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other telecommunications products could become a $8 billion market by 2002.
533	Here's my letter.
533	Any comments?
534	My comments below in red.
535	Jeff: Here are the draft definitions and the list of which companies are to review which definitions.
535	They have asked for our comments by the 15th (next Wednesday).
535	Please let me know if you have any questions.
535	Thanks!
535	Mark
536	Sorry we've been out of touch lately.
536	We were on vacation (sailing in the Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready for it the week or two before that.
536	There was a big swim meet in San Antonio last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).
536	I didn't even know you were leaving BA!
536	I knew you had been sort of looking around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.
536	What's the story?
536	We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the 18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details.
537	Sorry for the delay on getting back to you - looks good to me.
538	11:30 (10:30 Central) works for me.
539	Thursday afternoon and Wednesday both look pretty good for me so far.
540	I left a voice mail for Paul but have not heard back yet.
541	I have spoken with Martin and he is going to forward some proposed language to me.
541	I will need to draft a reply letter to try and solve their issue.
542	You assume correctly.
543	Your understanding is correct - the trades are binding on the legal entity holding the user id and password.
543	Any trades done which either the counterparty or we want to be with a different entity should be assigned pursuant to a written assignment agreement.
543	If the counterparty continues to misuse the system, maybe we should deny access to the types of products particular entities are not "supposed" to trade.
544	Excellent solution!
545	Lucy: Cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our form of agreement.
545	Their form is significantly more burdensome for us.
545	I would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially similar to one previously executed in connection with another matter.
545	Mark
546	Hi Marc!
546	Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat.
546	night for "Holiday Cheer" which at our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.
546	We'd love to see you guys.
546	It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go to, you could make this one the kick-off.
546	The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of champagne we're going to share at home that night.
546	I asked T if we should plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.
546	That, of course, will change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!"
546	around 12/29 or 30.
546	How's BMC?
546	What are you doing for them?
546	Do you know Clayton Williams?
546	I think he still works there.
546	Give us a call so we can catch up.
546	Tell G we said hi & hope to see you Saturday!
547	Looks good to me.
548	Any chance of getting the confirms to say "Ashland Inc. through its Ashland Specialty Chemicals Comapny division"?
548	Enron North America Corp.
549	Can you take care of this for me?
550	Here is the Confidentiality Agreement we signed last year.
551	CSC is Computer Science Corp. Joel's number is x57723.
552	Some of these are not final.
553	I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this problem.
553	What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and Enron which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of KN's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain products (e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and password will be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading entity) and all others will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their physical entity)?
553	Do you see any problems here?
553	Issues re: joint & several liability under the ETA but not the Transactions?
553	Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.
553	I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial objections.
553	Mark
554	My comments are marked below in red.
555	Same "calendar day" comment on the Gas Daily index.
555	"Succeeding" should have two c's.
555	On the Nymex index, what are we taking the "unweighed average" of?
555	This isn't clear to me.
555	Should "la" towards the end be capitalized?
556	Can you please check on this?
556	I thought we had wire-transferred the money to
557	Looks good to me!
558	Green
559	As per Gary's request, here is the revised letter.
559	If you will send the executed copies to me, I will arrange to have them signed on behalf of Enron.
560	Good catch!
560	And I agree, we're done.
561	You can send it to : Mark Taylor Enron North America - EB3889 1400 Smith Street Thanks!
562	Adele: Here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online Electronic Trading Agreement.
562	Please let me know if it is ok and I will have a copy executed and faxed over to you.
562	My apologies for the delay - I thought I had sent this to you last week but I can't find any record of it so I must not have done it.
562	Mark
563	Where do I go to see the products?
564	Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
564	I never did come up with a good solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the tree they didn't shake off.
564	This year she seems content to just hide underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just gotten too big.
564	I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about double-sided tape?
564	I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the tree).
564	And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.
565	Cindy: We have the signed letters - where should we send them?
566	Here is an example of what such a letter might look like which may satisfy several of the concerns you raised in our call this afternoon.
567	I do have some issues with the proposed language and will be discussing the details with Dale tomorrow.
568	How do you want to handle these?
569	Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage caution in how far you go with specific names.
569	Once they are tainted, it may not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for some time.
569	When would you like to go to New York to meet with Sullivan & Cromwell?
569	Let me know and I will set something up.
569	Mark
570	This looks fine to me.
570	Is this the way our confirmations read for telephone trades?
570	If not, do we need to make this change there also?
570	Mark
571	Looks good to me - It should probably get one last look by Mike Corbally, too.
572	That's fine with me - I don't anticipate any problems at this point.
572	Don't worry about losing days, though.
572	We can always make under the table adjustments next month if necessary.
573	Mark H. has asked me to prepare an outline of an "acceptable" regulatory framework for OTC energy derivatives that we could use as a fallback position next year.
573	Here is a draft I've come up with.
573	Any suggestions?
574	Friday at 10 looks good to us.
575	Thanks for your Christmas letter.
575	It was good to see how Celena has grown!
575	I'll be back in NYC Jan. 6 & 7 - any hope for dinner or at least a drink on Thurs.
575	eve.?
575	My flight is scheduled to get in around 6:45 pm.
575	Mark
576	Mark, You might want to check with Paul on this.
576	How have we arranged our IPE trading?
576	Since we are talking about exchange-traded contracts here, not dealing with customers, it may be possible to use an entity other than EEFT.
576	Hope all is well.
576	Mark
577	Louise - If you are back in Houston I'd like to get together and discuss the credit derivatives project.
577	Otherwise, maybe we can chat by phone?
577	Mark
578	I see what you mean.
578	Another thing we need to consider is whether or not this is part of our market maker status for the exchange - do you know if Bob wants Steve's activities in London to be part of that?
579	I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her conclusions.
579	For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.
579	That is the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue the tradition.
579	If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't know why we need to attach them for online trading.
579	If the back office needs a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem getting one for them.
580	Sounds good to me.
581	It's ok with me.
581	Please check with Tana and Susan as well.
582	I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance Office, the Traffic & Transportation Dept. (who gave me Ms. Dorsey's name) and have written to Ms. Dorsey.
582	I suggest you also complain to our City Council member and the other at-large members.
582	Since Dorsey is the Bikeway Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated bikeway but Council members want our votes: GABRIEL VASQUEZ gvasquez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think he represents the Heights ANNISE D. PARKER aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think Gordon has already written to her The last 5 are "at-large" members of the council.
582	I got all of these from the City web site so I can't be sure it's a current list.
582	Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less safe for residents there.
582	And p.s.
582	the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on I 10?
583	I have now heard back from Ken Raisler's office that the only time he has left next week is Thursday morning.
583	Does that work for you guys?
584	It looks like this didn't go through last night.
585	We sent ISDA our comments a couple of weeks ago.
585	I have resent them to Corinne this morning and sent a copy to you.
585	Enron North America Corp.
586	We are scheduled at Ken Raisler's office at 9:00 on Thursday.
586	The address is 125 Broad Street (on the eastern end of Broad St. - right by the East River).
586	See you there!
587	Any thoughts on this Platt's issue?
588	I called and asked for an information packet on the Enron insurance plan (it is through MetLife) last week.
588	I will let you know as soon as it comes.
588	Thanks for the update on Tim & Sharon.
588	I guess the down-side of a 2 year old is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to learn a new language easily.
588	Feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes - I seem to remember that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year.
588	I'll bet we can do it again!
588	And until then we can just bask in the light of this amazing run in the ENE stock price - wow!
589	Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85 A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES NEWS SPORTS BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT Filed at 3:21 p.m.
589	EST By The Associated Press LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has died.
589	He was 85.
589	O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College.
589	The cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date.
589	The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but newspapers and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday.
589	O'Brian had lived in France since 1949.
589	O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars.
589	A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail.
589	The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much like sailing.
589	Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical genre in which they generally were reviewed.
589	In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist you have never heard of.'' ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the brilliance of the writing.'' O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding.
589	Readers who can't remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to engage the enemy.
589	A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but O'Brian didn't think definitions important.
589	``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once said.
589	``Explanation almost certainly would be.'' O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of fiction.'' ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life.
589	He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an obituary Friday.
589	The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his name in 1945.
589	During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time reading.
589	His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.
589	During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with Britain's Political Intelligence Department.
589	In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France.
589	His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific expedition.
589	O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher W.W.
589	Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.
589	The rest, as they say, is publishing history.
589	Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph reported.
589	O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks.
589	A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and Colette.
589	O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.
589	Funeral plans were not announced.
589	He is survived by a son, Richard, from his first marriage.
590	Here is a revised version - let me know what you think.
591	Adele, Here is a revised version.
591	Let me know what you think.
591	Mark
592	This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private placement) in an internet/communications company.
592	My response was that Enron prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy commodity.
592	I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.
592	While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over the management of that competitor.
593	Good idea!
594	This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters.
594	In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.
594	Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.
594	In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control.
594	The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6(e).
594	And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another.
594	Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website.
594	In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like "Except as set forth under paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe master agreement shall prevail. If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to "The agreements listed beloweach comprises a" or better yet "Each agreement listed below is a" rather than "The agreements listed below comprise the".
595	We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.
595	Counterparties with a North American financial master agreement should only map to North American financial products (including all weather and paper transactions).
595	Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European derivative transactions.
595	Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.
595	Thanks!
595	Mark
596	I'm off to New York for a meeting but thought you might like to see this: Wednesday January 12, 11:30 am Eastern Time RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised Enron Corp's (NYSE:ENE - news) price target to $75 from $60 and cut 2000 earnings per share estimates.
596	-- raised price target because ``as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over the next 12 months, we anticipate that an additional $15 of value will be created for shareholders, with considerably greater value possible as the market develops.'' -- cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to -- "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in 2000.
596	Enron has built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in -- ``Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in trading electricity and natural gas.
596	After executing the first key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting rising transaction volumes, establishing the credibility of this new industry.'' -- ``The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise.''
597	Would you guys please take a look at this and let me know what sorts of restrictions you would suggest we try and put on these guys and what sorts of legal disclaimers/notices should be on the site?
597	Thanks, Mark
598	Have you seen this?
599	The SRRS indicates there are no requests awaiting my approval.
600	The flyer didn't come through - do you have a copy?
601	Don't be too hard on him just yet.
601	Remember that we talked about many similar issues here when they first came up.
601	Maybe after we've been through these with him once he will negotiate them in the first case and only bring the tough sticking points to us.
602	Just so you know what may be coming, I have spent roughly half of my time in the office over the last six weeks negotiating these sorts of requests.
602	It is very time consuming.
602	My comments below in red.
602	Best of luck and feel free to call with any issues.
602	Mark
603	Approved
604	I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people to be uploaded.
604	I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about.
604	These GTC's use the defined term "Commercial Term" which is defined as follows: "Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law that is issued in connection with a Transaction.
604	We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty (usually volume and price) and the Long Description.
604	We've gone to some lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long Description contain all of the necessary terms.
604	It's not clear to me that we intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of Commercial Terms.
604	Are these transactions not intended to be binding until the confirmation is signed?
604	Any thoughts on this?
605	I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell in NY) can't.
605	Any way for them to get access so they can advise us on this?
605	They are also the guys who will help with a training session on various legal issues and company policies in trading.
606	I thought your Mom might like the first three.
607	I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how well it worked for you to recieve them.
607	I took a roll of film to be developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as well as prints.
607	I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.
608	I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.
608	Just in case you are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes ago: Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.
608	He will appear on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m.
608	CST to discuss Enron's year-end financial and operating highlights.
609	I would like to attend.
610	Apparently there was some miscommunication.
610	It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.
610	It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.
610	As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.
610	Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.
610	While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.
610	We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls.
610	My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity.
610	We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.
610	Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible.
611	Yes, I think they could develop some initial thoughts with that kind of description.
612	Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday?
612	If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.
612	I'm not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious interference with contract, something like that.
612	I could discuss it with our friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify the perpetrator.
613	Looks good to me - there is a chance that I will be out Feb 14 - 18.
614	The vacation time looks good to me.
614	My trip is nowhere near final yet so let's hold off on rescheduling the credit group lunch.
614	Don't come back until you're well!
615	Thursday January 20, 4:51 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Enron Corp. Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides Business Overview and Goals for 2000 HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in Houston.
615	Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade.
615	Enron presented key objectives for 2000: Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
615	Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
615	Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.
615	Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day.
615	Wholesale Energy Business Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, Enron's largest business.
615	Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers.
615	Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.
615	Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.
615	Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November 1999.
615	Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million.
615	Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods.
615	Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.
615	Retail Energy Services With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide.
615	As the strong contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000.
615	Enron Energy Services' goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.
615	Enron Broadband Services The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband services.
615	Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point-to-point fiber network.
615	This Enron Intelligent Network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.
615	A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost capacity.
615	Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.
615	As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Internet services.
615	Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies.
615	The company, which owns approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business.
615	Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.'' This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
615	Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved.
615	Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries, the ability to penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband services markets, including the energy outsource market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of changes in interest rates, the timing and success of Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, communications, internet- related and other infrastructure projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements.

617	I have sent an analyst's report on Enron as an attachment to your msn address.
618	Thanks for the presentation - well done!
619	Yes - I actually read that first - I guess now we really have to make it work.
620	I have put it on my calendar.
621	I should be here.
621	Nella can set something up with Taffy.
621	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.
622	I don't see any problems.
622	It will become more challenging as we start thinking about trading.
623	Thanks for forwarding on the MSJ opinion.
623	Any objection to my sending it on to our US counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell) who are coordinating many of these issues for us?
624	In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.
624	This may be different in the physical trading world - I'll check into it.
625	It never ends.
626	Glad you liked them.
626	Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of spaces - grocery bags are always a good bet.
626	I remember Dusty, the cat we had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the covers.
626	Go figure.
626	I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me.
626	And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.
626	It's kind of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to really make it work!
626	I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.
626	I had a couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.
626	Do you want me to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst?
626	Love, Mark
627	FYI
628	II have tried to approve this through the Data Manager - not sure if it worked.
628	I know we must have been through this any number of times before but each time I read one of these I wonder how we are supposed to figure out the Notional Quantity.
628	It says "calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website" but how do we know how to calculate it?
628	Where does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number?
628	Gallons or Barrels?
628	I remain confused.
629	My comments/suggestions below in red.
629	As always, I'm happy to discuss.
630	Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?
630	The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers from reporting banks.
630	In the energy area a large proportion of the transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly disclose their positions.
630	Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy derivatives markets that would be helpful.
631	Here's a draft of a termination letter.
631	I'd be happy to see what everyone thinks before we use it.
631	For instance, what tone are we aiming for?
631	If we want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.
631	Let me know what you think.
632	Just a couple of comments and questions: Is it appropriate to refer to these as "US" transactions since the prices are clearly from outside the US?
632	I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I think this may be confusing to our customers.
632	The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work for pulp transactions?].
632	I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current confirmations?
632	In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word "relevent" should be deleted.
633	I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it definately a physical transaction?
633	where does the power get delivered?
633	If it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to look it over.
634	Here's one.
635	I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St. Clair to handle the ETA comments and negotiations.
635	I will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the details of what we have been doing so far.
635	It would make sense for you to meet her at some point in the near future.
635	She is not a junior lawyer by any stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal assistance.
635	In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL issues.
636	There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.
636	If that's not too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.
636	You can always call me from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of me.
636	It's finally winter here, too.
636	Of course that's nothing compared to you guys - it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.
636	It's only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.
636	Brrrr.
636	It was probably pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been packed!).
636	Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam mid-March.
636	I may try and get to South America sometime in February but nothing is scheduled yet.
636	Love, Mark
637	Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not possible to provide for different online contracts for different counterparties.
637	Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms of the ETA.
637	So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal department.
637	They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459).
638	Any concerns?
639	Yes, thanks - I think Tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the numbers.
640	Christian has not yet gotten back to me but I have asked him to check on the dates we discussed for early/mid March.
641	Do we know where J Aron wants us to settle the trade done from London?
641	If it is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not cause too much heartburn.
641	(See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next following.)
642	We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to the person who signed the PA.
642	Our theory was that the signer presumably has the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the password can also bind the counterparty.
642	If they want to give it to someone else, so be it.
642	But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.
642	I was told we were not looking into the authority of the "nominated" Master Users inn any way but that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.
642	It just seemed safer to me to take this approach.
643	The package you sent arrived today.
643	I'll open it when I get home.
643	I sent the MetLife insurance materials by regular mail today.
644	These look ok to me but I think somebody who knows what they're talking about should look at them too.
645	Jeff: Sorry for the delay - I'm still trying to track this down.
645	Obviously I don't know the answer right off and no one I've asked so far knows for sure (although those who know a little something about the area don't think it looks good).
645	I hope to have a final answer for you early next week.
645	Mark
646	How do these look to you?
647	You can ignore my previous e-mail.
648	My only concern is that the Floating Price is the Index for the Determination Period (which is a month) but the Index is a daily index.
648	Should we be taking the average for the month?
649	That looks good to me.
650	Here's another one.
651	This may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the SA restructuring.
651	In the past it was easy enough to justify using Don's budget since in theory all of your work was for his benefit.
651	Now it isn't quite so clear.
651	I think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting - is there a separate RC for Argentina trading?
652	I sent the web address of the address of the site we were talking about last week as part of another e-mail(1/27).
652	This is just to check and make sure you knew it was there and have been able to access the site.
653	The web site address is at the bottom.
654	Dear Schuyler: It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney people on swap documentation.
654	We used to send our new lawyers and more experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more experienced lawyers to the advanced course.
654	It appears that Euromoney is no longer putting this on.
654	Are you doing something similar through another provider?
654	Mark Taylor
655	The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could probably draft around it on a case by case basis.
655	It strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, the credit considerations are more problematic.
655	I would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades.
655	This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some respects.
655	When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom.
655	I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would that be acceptable to everyone?
655	Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.
655	That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities.
655	Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow.
655	Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).
656	We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece together the following: Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline (note spelling) trading page.
656	Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA and ETA executed.
656	Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them "guest" access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page.
656	On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to buy or sell) with Enron.
656	The page will list a reserve price and identify the number of credits to be auctioned.
656	We are willing to commit to transact up to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve price) but may transact larger volumes if we choose.
656	Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders.
656	Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full amount of their offer to buy.
656	It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction period but we would like to have that option.
656	I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.
656	Harry is preparing the "GTC" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on our standard contracts for these products.
656	We need to put the legal framework together for the rest of it.
656	If the existing PA and ETA are adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind.
656	We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of paper.
656	It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those counterparties would make sense.
656	Can we talk on Monday?
657	Just on the off chance you haven't had enough regarding EnronOnline to think about recently, Louise has announced meetings on Thursday and Friday of this week to discuss "Phase II" of the project.
657	It seems like an opportune time to come up with our wish-list of possible changes to the site and the legal structure.
658	I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but here it is.
659	That sounds right to me - we were going to pay for extra trips (like the ENA legal conference int eh fall) but this meeting is for all lawyers so they would have to pay for this regardless.
660	Jan: Thanks for your note.
660	Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference room - maybe you can coordinate with her.
660	It might also be nice if there is a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.
660	The only people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.
660	We will have a better idea of any audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.
661	The second product listed here is physical.
661	It looks ok to me but I don't really know - can you take a look and approve it or comment to Dale please?
661	Thanks!
662	Here's another one.
663	I have not received any comments.
663	I consider it final.
663	Let me know if you need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.
663	Since I don't know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they need it you send them copies.
664	Here is S&C's first draft.
665	Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the "auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" button.
665	As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.
665	Here is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other parties.
665	It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will be conducted.
665	Is that correct?
665	Any suggestions/comments?
665	Mark
666	I wish it were more clear.
666	I am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.
666	I had hoped to come this week but Randy is here in Houston.
666	Maybe second half of next week?
666	Do you know if everyone will be in those days?
666	(I was thinking Sao
667	Are either of you guys aware of this web-site?
667	It looks like our weather people have put this out on the web ahead of us.
667	I think we need to talk to them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should be there as well.
667	I just wanted to check with you before I call the weather desk here Mark
668	Paul is out sick today - I'll see what I can find out tomorrow.
669	Here are my comments (together with my voice mail comment to Dave regarding an earlier deletion).
670	Here are the procedures toegther with our comments.
670	If you have access to Word, you can see the changes and who made them.
671	I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.
671	It seems to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties (presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits).
672	Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?
672	It seems to me we should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have access.
672	If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade UK derivatives should have access.
672	Mark
673	It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.
673	They want this auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the expiration time.
673	There is still no commitment to sell anything.
673	All transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.
673	I have taken a stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind.
674	Here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or revoke bids during the auction period.
674	Comments?
675	FYI
676	I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.
676	I have not yet seen a list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal review.
676	The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is unclear).
676	The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.
676	For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on both sides of the walls.
677	With the final comment from Sullivan & Cromwell:
678	Is this a document that is available generall?
678	If so, can we get a copy?
679	Yes, this looks better to me.
680	FYI
681	I'm not sure I agree with you.
681	There is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.
681	The almost public nature of the marketing may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with Enron trading the product.
681	Even if they are not affected in this way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object.
682	I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use the camera - and thought you might like these.
682	Unfortunately the only shot on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group shot.
682	There were several others that you can tell would have been great shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.
682	The sunset was taken during our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing his lunch down below).
682	Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?
682	Mark
683	Edmund: Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of questions and minor points ont eh GTC - In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence.
683	Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters.
683	I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.
683	Is this particular to credit derivatives?
683	With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User.
683	It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the ETA.
683	Is the purpose of the second sentence to "deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?
683	If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties.
683	(I can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control.) I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.
683	If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days).
683	I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."
683	What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?
683	You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.
683	The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention.
683	This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives - should we apply a different interest rate to non-US$ payments?
683	It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US.
683	derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration.
683	We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US.
683	Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.
683	Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason?
683	Again.
683	sorry for the delay.
683	I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points.
683	Mark
684	There are a few points in here that you might be interested in - or not.
685	I received the proposed list of reference entities today.
685	Here is a draft of a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others within Enron for the restriced list.
685	Would you let me know what you think?
685	I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.
685	It isn't clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.
685	Since the communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is Kristina the right person?
685	I know that EES has some kind of joint venture with AOL - should Vicki sign off?
685	If it is going to such persons, should the memo come from Mark?
685	Cliff Baxter?

686	Enron North America and Enron Europe will offer credit derivatives throughthe EnronOnline website in the near future.
686	These products will provide foregularly scheduled payments by the purchaser and a payment by the seller ithe event of the bankruptcy of a specified &Reference Entity.8 For a number of reasons, including those identified below, Enron maintains a &Restricted List8 in connection with its credit derivatives business, which will list those entities that may not be included in the list of ReferenceEntities or that have been deleted from the list of Reference Entities.
686	This list is designed to comply with legal requirements, to deal with potentialconflicts of interest that might result because of our diverse activities,and to prevent the appearance of impropriety in connection with Enron,scredit derivatives trading activities.
686	The credit derivatives RestrictedList is designed for other purposes as well.
686	For example, a company may beplaced on the Restricted List if Enron is not able to assume any further credit exposure to that company or believes that market conditions do notwarrant the trading of Credit Derivatives on such Reference Entity.
686	A company ordinarily will be placed on the credit derivatives Restricted List, either before or after it has become a Reference Entity on which credit derivatives are traded, in the following circumstances: when Enron is actively engaged in effecting a material transaction with respect to such company that has not been publicly announced; when Enron has an applicable standstill agreement or other confidentialityagreement in place with such company; when Enron has a legal duty to keep such company's information confidentialand such company has not expressly consented to being a Reference Entity fopurposes of the trading of credit derivatives (such a legal duty may be afiduciary duty but may not rise to that level); when some part of Enron acquires material, nonpublic information about a company or its securities in the course of its business activities; when Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with respect to suchcompany.
686	The purpose of this memorandum is to alert you to this new business and torequest your assistance in evaluating proposed Reference Entities prior tothe trading of credit derivatives based on such companies.
686	Below is a listof proposed Reference Entities.
686	Please take a few minutes to look at thislist and then let me know if you are aware of any reason such companies should placed on the credit derivatives Restricted List.
686	If you have anyquestions, please contact me at (713)853-7459 or Paul Simons in the Londonoffice at 44-20-7783-6566.

687	My recollection is that we did this on purpose - that the industry works this way for all participants (or nearly all) so we built our documents to reflect that practice.
687	Do I remember correctly?
688	I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week.
688	They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I guess means March 9 at the earliest.
688	I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).
688	Unless an emergency comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will be towards the end of March (27 - 31?).
689	Here is the list of reference entities I received from Debbie with the confidentiality agreements and the reference entities they relate to indicated.
689	If the reference entity name is in bold we have a confidentiality agreement with the entity itself.
689	I notice that AOL, Nortel and Qwest are not on the list (they were on the original list for actual trading sent to me) - were they removed by you guys?

690	Brent - what is your home number?
690	You can get me at the office today (Monday until around lunch time, then you can try my cell phone 713-206-8080.
691	I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make sure the second item listed in them works.
691	Is everyone comfortable that the volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce megawatt hours?
691	I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - it wasn't immediately obvious to me.
692	This is getting a bit confusing - is this list included in Bryan's "Final" list?
693	Should we have Alan in this as well?
694	Looks fine to me.
695	These look ok.
695	I'm still unhappy with using an average of the index for each day when there is only one index for the entire month but I guess we're stuck with it for now.
696	Also fine - with the same "averaging" concern.
697	This one looks like it is in the "rejected" category.
697	How should I proceed?
698	My only concern is that it looks like we are modifying the NYMEX price twice - once in the second sentence and then again in th definition of Index.
699	Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.
699	There were also several from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.
699	I'll try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).
700	I have read the Lucent CA and it is OK to go ahead and keep them on the list - the CA seems to cover a relatively small transaction and expires on March 25 anyway.
700	We are in the process of pulling the CA's for Dow, DuPont, GE, IMC, 3M, Pitney Bowes, Praxair and Sprint.

702	Oops - that was supposed to be AT&T - Lucent is the one that lasts forever and deals with the Utility Solutions business.
703	Too bad you didn't call when you got in - I wasn't able to find Mr. B until about 8 - we missed the first half but went anyway.
703	Have you guys been up to anything fun lately?
703	Did you know T has a new job?
703	He's at an internet start-up called iVita.
704	He's doing PR and IR for them - what they do isn't entirely clear to me - something to do with accounting software I think.
704	They are going to launch a web site next month.
704	We'll have to get together and let him give you all the details.
705	The only ones we found any trouble with are ABB and Sanyo - the rest look clear for now.
706	What is the list of proposed Reference Entities for EnronOnline (to go live March 8?)?
707	Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending litigation?
707	How should we handle these?
707	Mark
708	Do any of you guys know about this deal?
709	Paul - Thanks for your voice mail.
709	We can't print the list of Reference Entities from the website because we have not been given access.
709	We do need to get that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the list that Michael referred to.
709	The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final list of Reference Entities for their launch.
709	That list absolutely must be scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.
709	Mark
710	Did you get a chance to look at the Credit GTC?
711	Carol St. Clair will be the swap lawyer for this transaction.
712	This is the site you had trouble looking at a few weeks ago - I had to send the address a couple of times.
713	Thanks - I needed a good smile today.
714	Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?
714	That is, from the contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the following day.
714	Sort of an internal vs. external issue.
714	Enron North America Corp.
715	There are still certain jurisdictions where we are not offering the product: Germany and Canada come to mind.
716	Bryan - In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a variety of people.
716	Mark
717	David - The Password Application and ETA look fine to me.
717	Mark
718	That is correct.
719	It never ends.
720	Do you want legal bills for this aspect of the project sent through on the EnronOnline work order or separately?
721	Thanks for your card and hello to the whole family.
721	I didn't know you guys were in Mass. Is this a long term move?
721	Things are still pretty much the same in Houston.
721	We'd certainly look forward to seeing more of you down this way!
722	As we discussed, attached is the new list of proposed reference entities.
722	I have also attached my previous memo outlining the propsosed business and our concerns.
723	Can we do the call at 3:00 Houston time?
724	I'll be there - is it really only to last 2 hours?
725	Why is Enron's stock so volatile now?
725	Since today's session started, ENE has lost another $2.50!
725	Mr. Ken Lay replies I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several reasons it's more volatile.
725	But before I comment on that, our stock price is still up even if it went down that much today.
725	It's up 40% since the beginning of the year when the Dow was down.
725	As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up about 75%.
725	That's one reason why it's so volatile.
725	Some people bought in along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off the table.
725	As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a growth stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, just like all the other companies that fit into that category.
725	Throughout the market, technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but often $10-$12-$15 a whack.
725	What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the upside, but I hate it on the down side.
725	We've had a change in the ownership of our stock.
725	Increasingly, it's being bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower P/E stocks.
725	I know this makes everybody a little nervous, but this is probably the world we're in now.
725	I'd rather be in this world with a 50 P/E than the more stable world with a 20 P/E.
726	I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com page.
726	That process is now underway.
726	Going forward, I would hope that we will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites before a reference entity is used.
727	I'm not sure anyone told you about this - can you make it on Friday?
728	I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.
728	I assume it's a physical concept.
728	If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right person.
728	If it's gas, probably Stacy.
729	Please give me a call and we can discuss.
729	Shari is now definately moving to power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are going to cover all the bases - short and long term.
729	I will be out the 14th through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.
729	It would be grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself that much.
729	Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is covered.
730	I am not available at all on Friday through Tuesday but the meeting can go ahead without me if necessary.
730	Enron North America Corp.
731	Here is a set of disclaimers for your website.
731	Have you looked into getting the name trademarked?
731	If not, let me know and I can try and move that along from here.
732	Sorry - it looks like I can not attend.
732	My travel schedule is pretty tight this month - do you think it makes sense to set something up for April?
732	Enron North America Corp.
733	David - I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.
733	If you have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this for Australia it would be very helpful to me.
733	I have what we've used in Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.
733	Thanks, Mark
734	That's perfect - let's aim for May - thanks Enron North America Corp.
735	Ken: Mark H. asked me to forward to you this initial draft term sheet.
735	We would like to talk to you, and presumably one of your colleagues, tomorrow regarding the possible antitrust implications of the proposed structure.
735	Please give me a call and we can schedule a time.
735	Thanks, Mark
736	Dave - Do we have a copy of this marked to show the changes fromt he NA ETA?
737	I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only counterparties.
737	The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement.
738	May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single page.
738	This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid out here.
738	I was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user ID and password could be issued.
738	While I don't object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form.
739	Then from a legal perspective I don't have any issues.
739	Enron North America Corp.
740	Edmund - I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives (I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).
740	Basically I don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.
740	My other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't think the Buyer Payment language works - can you give me a call so we can discuss my concerns?
741	Ken - here is another (brand new) issue Mark H. asked me to forward on to you that he would like to discuss this afternoon in the anti-trust call.
742	This looks good to me.
742	Thanks!
743	I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.
743	I agree completely re: the need for a procedure.
743	Let me know what you think about the following: 1.
743	Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards the name to Credit.
743	At the same time, the commercial team should be identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).
743	2.
743	Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).
743	If approved, Credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron relationships.
743	3.
743	Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.
743	If the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review.
743	If the commercial team considers the RE the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.
743	In addition, if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the "other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.
743	Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).
743	Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on the website.
743	Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.
744	Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality agreements listed below?
744	I need to know who the parents are and who the subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the reference entity.
744	Thanks, Mark
745	Please forward copies of the ETA and PA to Paul Davis (e-mail address above).
745	If you don't have them in your directory, Frank Davis should be able to get them to you.
745	Thanks, Mark
746	Yes, this is fine with me.
747	Edmund: Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.
747	I don't think it makes sense to review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.
747	Please let me know if the situation changes.
747	Mark
748	Can I get a copy?
748	I don't really know what we're talking about.
749	Rod - I got your voice mail & we can talk when I get back.
749	Here is a note I sent to Edmund last week with a suggestion - let me know what you think.
750	I certainly haven't seen anything and there is nothing in our database - you might check with Shari Stack (I'm in Portland until Wed.).
751	Lori - here is the initial "wish list" from the credit derivatives people.
751	If you can focus on these first and let me know about them I'd appreciate it.
752	Any idea what Bryan plans to gain this way?
752	It's not clear to me that a hard wall solves our problems with RE approvals but that's because I don't know.
752	Maybe Ken can shed some light on this.
753	David - Thanks for your note.
753	Just to keep you posted - I plan to be there with my boat but will return to my slip at Kemah Harbor and drive over to the party so I won't add to the size of your raft.
753	Mark
754	What time is the game on Saturday?
755	I have received reactions from several of the other Enron operating companies (EBS, EES and GPG) requesting that the following entities be placed on the Restricted List for credit derivatives Reference Entities: AT&T Corp. Baltimore Gas & Electric Company Bell Atlantic Corporation BellSouth Corp. Cable & Wireless plc Comdisco, Inc. Cox Communications, Inc. Intel IBM Lucent Technologies Monsanto SBC Communications Sun Microsystems Union Carbide Viacom Wisconsin Electric Power Company Wisconsin Gas Company These companies were those on the attached list (forwarded to the various General Counsels on 2/28) which were found to be objectionable for one reason or another.
755	I have not yet heard from the former EI companies.
756	I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS where I feel sure some of them were commercial.
756	I'm not so sure about the EES and GPG lists.
756	These lists are going to some fairly senior people.
756	I'm a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.
756	My suggestion would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you particularly want to list.
757	We had hoped to have an answer from local counsel in Japan by the end of last week.
757	Unfortunately we have not yet heard from them.
757	Alan Aronowitz has sent an e-mail asking for an update on their progress.
757	As soon as we have their answers to our questions, we will be able to prepare an ETA for counterparties trading from Japan.
758	Hi Mary.
758	Barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be coming back to join the department.
758	Hooray!
758	I was hoping we could chat about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time around.
758	I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.
758	Mark T.
759	Mark H. suggested this morning that he, you and I should plan on getting together for dinner on Thursday evening.
759	I'm leaving for the airport here in a few minutes and will be reachable in Amsterdam at the Grand Hotel or on my
760	Hmmm.
760	- Barbara wasn't 100% sure of your e-mail address.......
761	one more try.....
762	I will not be able to attend Thursday's call.
763	Did we ever talk about this?
763	The traders (Bob Crane in particular) are giving Dale a hard time - they want to start trading this way immediately.
764	my comments made below
765	Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the aftermath.
765	I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I haven't read it yet.
765	I don't anitcipate any problems.
765	I can't tell from these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11 or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have already executed PAs and been approved).
766	I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular publication?
766	If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and check for older prices there and you can cite to that.
766	Let me know if that doesn't work.
767	Do we have a Netherlands ETA?
768	That's fine with me.
769	David: Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by non-Australian counterparties.
769	The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process going forward.
769	Any chance you might be available for a telephone conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?
769	Mark
770	My attempts to open this link result in an error message that I am not authorized to perform that operation.
771	Pets In the Office It's A Growing Trend In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some companies.
771	Workers are bringing their pets to the office.
771	Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has been taking his golden retriever, Hoss, to work for the last five years.
771	Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co-Anchor Jane Clayson.
771	The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek.
771	"He brings a lot of emotion and people love it. He's very relaxed."
771	But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes.
771	Not everybody can bring their pet to work.
771	"A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog.
771	"He just hangs out," explains Paucek.
771	"He's easy to get along with."
771	Hoss has free rein at the office.
771	When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office," Paucek says.
771	While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also many legal issues to consider.
771	John Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing.
771	"More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," says Challenger He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy.
771	"One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a policy like that, is take a poll of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain employees that don't feel comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy."
771	There are liability questions as well.
771	For example, the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee.
771	"The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect," says Challenger.
771	"The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone, it can't be the company's fault."
771	Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office.
771	"Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, will you put them in a certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? Many don't feel comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds? What about the noise of birds?"
771	Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets chaotic."
771	In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners.
771	They found that: 21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the job 33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off-limits-to-pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should make a rotating schedule.
771	When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great.
771	Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the employees. He has his own web page."
772	This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an objection.
773	This doesn't seem to allow me to approve.
774	Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.
774	Since we only have $500 left and they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send someone.
774	I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and whether or not they still want us to send someone.
775	Stacy Carey called back to say that the $500 would appreciated as would a person to attend.
775	I didn't know if you had anyone who could go so I suggested that someone from your office call her on Monday morning to discuss details.
775	Stacy's number is (202)457-6545.
776	Cynthia: Here is a first draft of an agenda for our meeting this afternoon.
776	Mark
777	Here is the revised Koch confirmation marked to show the changes.
778	I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date as the Buyer Payment Date.
778	In the version I send to Koch I will change that to Trade Date.
778	You can always change it to a later date if you want to tomorrow.
779	I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth.
779	I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last week.
779	My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC.
780	Attached is the confirmation revised to include Ken's most recent comments.
781	Tana - please mark up the draft with these comments so I can see what they look like.
782	Jay - Thanks for your note.
782	This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.
782	The problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.
782	Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.
782	As for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.
782	For instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.
782	Was there ever any follow-up with them on that?
782	Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to look like an official contract).
782	Is the Telerate information also available from other sources?
782	Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very similar information?
782	Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate regarding the services they provide to us?
782	Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be trying to do this the "right" way.
782	Mark
783	There are no requests awaiting my approval.
784	Thanks for the messages - I have not heard anything since they left.
784	VERY good news!
785	I'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening existing products to Japanese counterparties.
785	Is he talking about the existing GTC's for petroleum products?

788	Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next week?
788	I'm setting up dinner with Doc (instead of the Private Dining Room affair) in case you're interested.
789	When I try to open the link I get an error message saying "You are not authorized to perform that operation."
789	There are still no requests awaiting my approval in the SRRS icon on my desktop.
789	Sorry!
790	Doc: The schedule calls for the meetings to end at 5:00.
790	There's also a play (The Merry Wives of Windsor) that night and we can work around that if you were planning on going.
790	Mark
791	Thanks for forwarding all of this stuff - so far it has all been mine.
791	I think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they just type in Mark Taylor.
791	It's not nearly as bad as when there was another Mark E Taylor - and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either (instead of forwarding them to me, he would send them back to the senders with sometimes nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').
791	Luckily for both you and me he is no longer with Enron -- can you imagine how bad it would be if there were three of us?
791	When I get these, I usually send a note back to the sender letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention when addressing things to one or the other.
791	Mark
792	"Good meal" in Monmouth?
792	Not sure if that is really possible by your standards.
792	I had the Barnstormer in mind.
792	It pretty much has to be better than the food at the Stockdale Center.
793	You might want to take a read through this one more time just to make sure I have it the way you want it.
794	Approved.
795	I had a note back from Doc asking if we wanted to go to the play after dinner.
795	If we're not interested he can go on Sunday but if we want to go he'll get us tickets.
795	I can go either way - what do you think?
796	Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.
796	It seems pretty clear to me that the Pres.
796	has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.
796	I asked Mark Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to join us for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since I'd like to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting.
797	Please order enough books for the swaps group and a few extras.
798	Alan: Regarding the legal comments below: My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue: i.e. the umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice of law provision.
798	These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan.
798	This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.
798	As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated.
798	When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us.
798	I don't know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to.
798	There is no standard agreement for online trading.
798	The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.
798	The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed.
798	In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.
798	Mark
799	Rousseau: I have copied you on an e-mail to Alan Aronowitz which may answer your questions.
799	If not, please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues.
799	If I am not at hand when you call, my assistant can book a particular time on my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever.
799	Mark
800	Mark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets for us that would be great.
800	My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday morning so I can always stay up late to chat!
800	I'll be there Thursday morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that - any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?
800	Mark
801	Any further news from Russia?
801	There's a good chance I'll have to go to DC for a day tomorrow & if they're back I might be able to get up there to see them - I could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that I could spend the evening with them.
802	FYI
803	What do you think?
803	OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed again).
804	Allison - I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three companies.
804	I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone else.
804	My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm.
804	and I assume that the Luken meeting will be over around 3:00.
804	Enron North America Corp.
805	FYI
806	Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over EnronOnline.
806	I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential dates.
807	Hey Marc!
807	- We're in town this weekend - let us know if you plan something.
808	Mario - We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch in Japan.
808	The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they should be enforceable in Japan as well.
808	Local counsel is aware of our business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.
808	We have not looked into the registration of domain names in Japan.
808	Please let me know if this is required.
808	Mark
809	Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the airport in Minneapolis.
809	I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital campaign planning committee meeting.
809	Mark Kopinski was there and he and I had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. professors) who is still teaching.
809	I'm now on my way back to Houston - flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.
809	Hope you are well.
809	Love, Mark
810	Are you sure about this?
810	I didn't know I had a NY bar number.
811	Looks good to me.
812	Robbi: The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late February, a copy of which is attached.
812	No proposed regulations have resulted but could come out at any time now.
812	There is also some activity on the Hill (bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.
812	We have been monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.
812	Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.
812	Mark
813	I don't think this one will work for us - we would prefer a college degree.
814	Angelica lacks an undergraduate degree.
815	Yes, so far that is the plan.
816	The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for North America unless they need revision for some commercial reason.
816	I will try and get to the FAQ's tomorrow.
817	Sorry I didn't get to you today - I have kept a slot on my calendar at 9:00 Houston time tomorrow if that works for you.
818	I will not be able to attend.
819	I will be out the 5th but plan to be here the 12th and 24th.
820	I have not - happy to coordinate with you.
821	See my answers below.
822	Can't we just transfer the billing to me?
823	Alvin: It was good to meet you at lunch the other day.
823	Here are my address details if you need them.
823	Mark E. Taylor Enron North America Corp. (EB3889) 1400 Smith St.
824	We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax or other legal consequences to their trading.
824	The only thing we could safely say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax advisor."
825	Here are my FAQ comments - all of the existing answers are still correct.
826	We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's reactions to the interviews.
826	If you have other resumes we would be happy to look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they are not superstars (like the person we are losing).
826	Mark
827	Stanford: My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000 at the end of the sentence.
827	Otherwise it all looks good to me.
827	I will forward everything on to Mark Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates issue.
827	Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.
827	Mark
828	Mark: Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.
828	You will see that while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant progress on the indemnity.
828	I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to include affiliates.
828	If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we discussed with them the other day).
828	Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to coordinate your reactions with Dave.
828	If you need me, please leave a voice-mail or ask my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.
828	Mark
829	Hi Dave: Thanks for your note!
829	It's hard to believe that Washington House was over twenty years ago now.
829	I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law school in Michigan.
829	My first job after graduating was for a law firm in Houston.
829	They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to help out.
829	The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.
829	One of those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong.
829	I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues.
829	We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically.
829	I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping them get some products ready to trade online.
829	I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th.
829	I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C.
829	from time to time.
829	Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century.
829	I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch very well.
829	There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations.
829	And I understand there are big plans for more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library.
829	Enrollment is up above 1000.
829	Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well!
829	There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.
829	I guess we really did learn something while we were there.
829	Let me know if you ever get to Texas.
829	It would be fun to get together and catch up.
829	Mark Taylor 1322 Rutland St.
830	I have asked the tax guys to talk to you directly since I am in South America this week.
830	If you have not heard from them, you might try calling Stephen Douglas or Jeff Blumenthal.
830	They are the tax experts for EnronOnline.
831	Thanks for your note.
831	My company has revised our e-mail addresses.
831	Please change my address in your records to Mark.Taylor@enron.com.
831	Thanks!
832	I have no objection to changing the product name.
832	The tax issue concerns the location of the trader - if the guy managing the prices is in London but the transactions are with ENA, there may be tax implications.
832	Mark
833	Taffy - I've been having trouble getting this e-mail to go through to Robin Tompkins at Portland General.
833	Would you please either find Robin's correct e-mail address and forward it to her or call and get her fax number and fax it to her.
833	Thanks.
833	Mark
834	Any idea why this question came up?
835	My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline: 1.
835	The online "making of a market" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2.
835	The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction.
835	3.
835	The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation of the "Stack Manager" which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person.
835	4.
835	EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line "short description" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.
835	5.
835	The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place.
835	6.
835	It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application) 7.
835	The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders.
835	8.
835	Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested.
835	9.
835	The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.
835	Mark Taylor Enron North America Corp.
836	Here's another lawyer applicant for the paralegal job - I don't remember this one either......
837	This one I remember seeing before but I don't remember making an interview decision one way or the other.
838	Thanks Tara!
839	Thanks for your quick reply.
839	My apologies for asking so many questions witobvious answers.
839	I hope I didn't waist too much of your time.
839	I also had a chat with Dave Forster yesterday in which he set me straight on many of theissues.
839	Thanks for creating all of this so fast!
839	Mark
840	I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.
840	While they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that fit in the docking station?).
840	In case it isn't working, can we get her set up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday morning?
840	Mark
841	I haven't been able to get into any off these things.
841	Do you know what they are?
842	My only comment would be to suggest that the Password Application and registration form be referred to as "available online".
842	Describing them as "online" forms may lead some to believe that they can be filled out and submitted online while in fact the Password Application must be printed out and signed before being sent to us.
842	Mark
843	I will be out of the office at a seminar on Thursday and Friday of this week.
844	I am in an all-day seminar tomorrow and Friday - I'm afraid we may have to miss this one.
845	Jason - if you have time, would you please take a look at this?
846	We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.
846	Well, maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle.
846	But I do have several questions: Do we have a similar system here in NA?
846	Are we expected to review all of these?
846	Is there some way to filter out the junk?
846	To whom should I address these questions?
847	Here is the Japanese repsonse which also contains our inquiry.
848	I don't think this person's experience is the right fit for our paralegal position.
849	This person doesn't have the kind of experience that we are looking for but she might work for one of the other groups in the department.
849	I am forwarding this to Ann-Elizabeth White who may know of an appropriate spot.
850	These do not appear in my SRRS but I would approve them if I could.
851	This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could.
852	In case you have to work late again and need a smile or two......
853	In the future, please print these out for me instead of sending them by Thanks!
854	I agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea.
854	Either the electronic or manual system will be admissable, but the electronic system strikes me as more reliable.
854	I'm more concerned witht he effectiveness of the notification - it's still not clear to me that adding a line on the ticker will be satisfactory.
854	In fact, it clearly is not satisfactory for changes in the ETA or a GTC.
854	Those documents will have to be clicked on again if any changes are made, the only remaining question being how do you highlight the changes.
854	The significant gray area is still changes to the Long Descriptions.
855	Yes, I will take care of this one.
856	Let me know if this is what you had in mind.
857	Is this for you?
858	I have revised my profile to give you calendar management access - sorry about the delay.
859	Thanks for taking care of this!
859	Sorry if I caused any confusion.
860	Release Date: 05/04/00 New York Mercantile Exchange Announces E-Commerce Venture FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Maria Gonzalez NEW YORK, NY, May 4, 2000 - The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX, an e-commerce venture that is intended to become the premier, global exchange for over-the-counter (OTC) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts.
860	The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture.
860	The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position.
860	eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, depending on the session.
860	The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets.
860	The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot cash market products also offered.
860	Over time, this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, weather, and emissions.
860	Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations.
860	In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC trading.
860	Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, "The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts."
860	Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems: ?
860	Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange.
860	?
860	The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with "bricks & mortar".
860	?
860	The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be used to provide counter-party risk management ?
860	Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities.
860	eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
861	Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave the meeting I was in with her to call.
861	I tried to call you in London just now but there was no answer.
861	If you are still around, please feel free to try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy to set up a time that works for you.
861	Mark
862	The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.
862	Before I talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues you know of?
862	Thanks, Mark
863	David; Here are our initial thoughts regarding the Posting Agreement form.
863	I shoube in all day today and tomorrow.
863	Please feel free to call to discuss.
863	At the closing of the Transaction, the Company and Enron will enter into a&Posting Agreement8 pursuant to which Enron will agree to post prices for certain products to the Company,s platform in a manner that permits theCompany,s customers to electronically attempt to transact, through theCompany,s website but on EOL,s database, with respect to Subject Prod(defined below).
863	The Company will provide, at the Company,s expense and in accordance witEnron,s specifications and technical requirements t[specifications annexan interface which will be used by Enron to post prices for Subject Producton the Company,s website.
863	Enron will provide, at Enron,s expense and in accordance with Enron,s specifications and technical requirements [annexan interface for the Company,s customers to attempt transactions (as discussed below) on the EOL database.
863	The parties will also establish a credit interface to facilitate Enron,s credit decisions with respect toattempted transactions.
863	The Company,s customers will be permitted to attempt to transact againstprices posted by Enron at Enron,s sole discretion.

864	Would you please take care of this ASAP
865	Here is the draft of the questionnaire for local counsel.
865	Let me know what you think.
866	If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform (group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is checking).
866	If the NDA is something else, please let me know.
867	Thanks for that - I had completely forgotten about the insurance issue.
868	This is why he never got it.
869	I think these will be the first days Susan Bailey gets back from being out.
869	Please make sure this is OK with her and you guys coordinate on what's going on.
870	You're right - I had my weeks mixed up.
870	Since we are one person short I'd still appreciate it if you guys would coordinate to make sure there isn't any undue confusion.
871	Thanks Mark - these are mine and I'll ask Louise to be more careful in her addressing.
872	Please be careful in addressing e-mails to me - several of yours (re: Follow-up on Friday's meeting) have gone to the other MarkTaylor (Mark A Taylor).
872	I just found out when he forwarded them on to me.
873	Please respond to peoplefinder
874	It looks like we should send him the term sheet.
875	Frank - There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.
875	I am working on the Posting Agreement.
875	I'm afraid Louise may have thought more highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.
875	Travis McCullough, our corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his schedule permits).
875	I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both sides are getting it right).
875	Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we can.
875	Mark
876	Yes - in fact it is already on my calendar!
877	I am available - best after 6:30 or 7:00.
877	Where is always difficult - quieter as opposed to noisy & crowded - but not dead either (I'm not picky am I?).
877	Any suggestions?
878	They shouldn't be doing any trading so I hope we won't need those things.
879	What is your anticipated start date in Houston?
879	We need to work on a place for you to sit.
880	I got a call from AEP asking that we have Louise initial the changes we made in the CA and fax it back to them - is she here today?
881	This is the North America version.
881	There are a number of variations for different jurisdictions.
881	You can see them all on the website by going to enrononline.com and then going to the "How to Register" page.
881	There is a drop-down that lists all of the available PA's.
882	Justin - David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to get people to use EnronOnline.
882	They want to set up a sports fantasy league system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding prizes to the winners.
882	The first proposal relates to European football (I think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston time Tuesday.
882	Any chance you might be available to listen in?
883	They said they had agreed but I have not seen a copy initialed by them.
884	Mark - You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction as two separate issues.
884	For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any particular court.
884	The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to sue us in Alberta.
884	Mark Taylor
885	Yes, I spoke to her earlier this week.
886	Sorry I didn't get back to you in response to your voice-mail.
886	I was hoping I could talk to Carol and Sara to see if anyone remembers why we incorporate the Credit Support Documents by reference.
886	Regarding the cross-default, we usually do not expand the definition since we don't want to bring in other derivatives transactions - of course that was before we started doing derivatives under various master agreements with the same entities.
886	It may be time to revisit this one.
887	Looks good to me.
888	This looks fine to me.
888	The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the initial survey done in Europe last year.
888	In this case, I assume that Lynn is taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax issues.
888	In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it was sent to counsel.
889	In this case, I would view you as Andrea's supervisor and I would be her representative at the PRC which would be here in Houston.
890	Alan - I know Jeff is out of town and may not see this right away so I thought I would forward it on to you.
891	Steve: Here is the most recent draft of the swap agreement.
891	The marked copy (the second attachment) shows the changes with the exception of the payee tax rep which has been deleted in the clean version.
891	Mark
892	Will putting this in the confirmation give the accountants heartburn over treating the transaction as a swap?
893	Please remember to go into the Performance management System to select reviewers for this series of performance reviews.
894	Please remember to go into the Performance Management System to select reviewers for this series of performance reviews.
895	Bryan - The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.
895	Several of them then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.
895	Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at once instead of piecemeal.
895	What do you think?
895	Mark
896	Thanks for your note.
896	In reply: 1.
896	We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.
896	2.
896	and 3.
896	We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral.
896	As you point out, it is likely that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document.
896	There are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document.
896	Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.
896	Mark
897	That certainly makes sense to me.
897	I had better talk to Paul about the appropriate procedures going forward.
898	I was assuming that Paul might have a process set up for the UK and that we could copy most of it.
898	Do you know if he has created one already?
899	Done.
899	My only comment is that there should be an apostrophe in "Sellers" in the third line up from the bottom.
900	Looks good to me.
901	There is a meeting on my calendar for Friday morning to discuss Phase 2 content issues with people from the Research Group - not sure if this is the same issue or not.
902	Susan - Please send this guy a sample form of each of the Omnibus, Industrial and ISDA (both printed form and schedule).
902	Thanks
903	Jason - would you take a quick look at this - I think Legal in London will be negotiating it so you don't have to be particularly thorough - but I thought you might have some insights given your recent experience with our other content agreements.
903	Thanks, Mark
904	I agree with you 100%.
904	I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone else - in such a public manner.
904	If he feels there is a problem that should be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.
904	In this case, a direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he should have approached either you or Mike.
904	Sending out an e-mail that might be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly contrary to our core value of Respect.
904	I hope you are able to have some input into the review process for John and this should certainly be mentioned.
904	If you need my help in any way, please let me know.
905	REMOVE
906	Craig - There was no attachment to your e-mail.
906	Is it coming in hard copy?
906	Mark
907	I can make it next week.
907	Travis will be on vacation but we can patch him in by phone.
907	Ken is available from 9 to 11 and then again from 3 or 4 onwards.
907	Which would you prefer?
908	Approved.
909	Another thing we'd like to talk about on Monday is the danger of becoming a Commodity Trading Advisor and the kinds of things we should look out for in the proposed website content.
909	For example, we have heard repeated references to "market commentary" and we will need to develop some sort of guidelines to give the commentators.
910	Please revise my entry in the Web Directory to show my new e-mail address - Mark.Taylor@enron.com - and my Greek affiliation as Zeta Beta Tau.
910	Thanks!
910	Mark Taylor, '78
911	I agree with you on 1, Passport should be Password and I have put a call in to Tony Pryor to ask about #3.
912	Here is the most recent draft of the Posting Agreement which we would like to discuss with you at our meeting tomorrow.
913	This is certainly a tough one.
913	We go to great lengths to avoid regulation here and have been fairly successful to date.
913	We do have some oversight from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding our power trading and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised.
913	If it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations (but that's just complying with the Eligible Swap Participant and Trade Option Exemption rules).
913	It is true we are a member of the NYMEX and subject to their rules but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the NYMEX.
913	It might be more helpful to talk to the guys in London about our SFA regulatory status.
913	We have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states.
914	Sorry about the delay.
914	Here are my responses: 1.
914	Yes, this is primarily a tax issue.
914	However, there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific PA provisions for those countries.
914	2.
914	No. Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that only the first time they trade that product.
914	The GTC's are arranged by "Product Type" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade.
914	3.
914	No. But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.
914	4.
914	This one doesn't make much sense to me.
914	EnronOnline itself doesn't make any money.
914	There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.
914	EnronOnline is actually providing them a service.
914	5.
914	I really have no idea.
914	I guess we would have to print out the records and have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified.
914	6.
914	So far we haven't deleted anything.
914	If we need to keep the records for a long time we probably can but this has not been discussed.
915	Were you thinking about presenting re: EnronOnline or attending to hear what the others have to say?
916	Here is my first cut - what do you think?
917	Here is the language I mentioned in my voice mail.
917	Cynthia Sandherr's office should be getting in touch this afternoon with the addresses, forms of address, etc. The letters need to be hand delivered in DC on Monday so they need to be fed exed to our DC office tonight.
917	Please call if you have any questions.
917	Thanks!
917	Mark
918	Dan - How does this look?
919	Jason Peters (x39720) will be able to go with you - you might meet with him a bit ahead of time to fill him in on what you plan to do.
920	This looks like and ISDA comparison to me.
920	I'm not sure who is next on the list......
921	Sorry for the delay - this looks fine to me.
922	What about a "Personal Best" award?
923	Jeff & Carol: As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.
923	Mark
924	Dave: Here is the agreement I received from London which I have revised to apply to the Chicago situation.
924	Let's consider this a rough draft at present.
924	It does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work.
924	let's get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't.
924	Let me know what time works for you.
924	Mark
925	Craig - There was nothing attached to your e-mail so I assumed you were sending something by hard copy - we haven't received anything yet.
925	Mark
926	I was here.
927	Thanks for figuring this out!
928	Outside counsel reviewed EnronOnline content such as the FAQ, Legal and Privacy Statement and anything else we were concerned might create the basis for an agreement regarding how the site was used.
928	We reviewed everything else internally.
929	I've never heard of these guys - not sure who this could have been meant for.
930	Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?
930	Some other sites let you know what time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.
931	We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.
931	First, I believe our agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.
931	It might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating when it was last refreshed.
931	Many sites providing quotes like this have a line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.
931	Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still feel like you need to add something you might check with him.
932	FYI
933	Paul - I think we handled this in Phase I through the Legal and Privacy Statement which is available through a link from each EnronOnline page, including the home page.
933	If memory serves, the advice (including the language for the Legal and Privacy Statement) came from Clifford Chance.
933	Justin will probably be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time.
933	Will that be sufficient for Phase II?
933	We can revise the Legal and Privacy Statement if that is necessary.
933	Mark
934	The EnronOnline guy responsible for the video is trying to get the contractor we used to get these guys to stop using our name.
934	Louise may want us to contact them if he is not successful.
935	As long as the coal lawyers have approved the contract forms it looks good to me.
936	This one came after the one you sent (which I commented on by voice mail) but is even worse.
936	I hope it was an earlier draft rather than a later one.
937	This sounds reasonable to me - any objections?
938	Either works for me.
939	Michele: Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol: 1.
939	In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I believe an additional 10-12 days).
939	2.
939	After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence until December 31, 2000.
939	Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
939	Mark
940	Let's stick with what we already have on order.
940	Is Frank ready to start Phase III as soon as Phase II is done?
941	Attached is the story with my comments.
941	1.
941	I changed 'standard" to 'familiar' and deleted the reference to price discovery since these are elements of futures contracts, comparison to which we would like to avoid. If the price reference is important, 'transparency' would work as a replacement for 'discovery.' 2. The changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the PA and Reg. forms can be filled out online (they are available to be downloaded but must be signed and sent to us offline).
942	Thought you might be interested in this.
943	Do you know when they are building the walls around the cube we designated for Janet Moore?
943	She is concerned.
944	David: Do you see any problems with a customer having the ability to chat with an Enron representative online?
944	Mark
945	Looks good to me - We should probably change Enron North America Corp. to
946	Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.
946	David Mitchell thought he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he remembers it, we never got very far with the details.
946	He probably just advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and should be Chinese Wall fenced as well.
946	I'll send over whatever we receive from him and warned him that you might be calling.
947	My comments: It's not clear to me what it means to say that Joe Hockey "joined" in the launch (end of first paragraph).
947	They may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in the fourth paragraph have increased (I think it's up to $90 bil.) .
947	The word "values" should probably be "value" in the last line of the fourth paragraph.
947	Mark
948	Will this only be available inside the house?
949	Answer: Conde Nast Traveler Mark E. Taylor 1322 Rutland
950	As per John's request.
951	The most recent news is that Carol has been admitted to the hospital and is in labor - things are looking ok.
951	I'll let you know if I hear anything new.
952	Do you have time to talk about the direct connection issues tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon at 3:00 NY time?
952	I also have some new issues regarding the need (or hopefully lack thereof) for written confirmations of online transactions which we can tee up then.
953	On that basis I think we can go ahead without any trouble.
954	Do you want to take a stab at this?
954	I'm happy to go over it with you if you are unsure.
955	This looks fine to me.
955	I would feel better without the Big "E" on the screen since I wouldn't think you would want to give the impression that each of your trading floors was an Enron office.
956	Here is the revised confirm - let's chat about the issues I mentioned in my voice mail.
957	Here is the confirm with the "out" built in.
958	Note that the No "Out" version requires us to pay the premium on Tuesday!
959	The least we can do is pass this news along.
959	Is there anyone else we should tell?
960	I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size).
961	Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires?
961	I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me.
962	FYI
963	If you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in Amsterdam) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets.
963	I don't know where this stands officially (I haven't heard any developments since Amsterdam) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want.
964	Current Plan: Days away: Sept. 21 through Oct. 3 (assuming you work on the day we leave and go back to work the day after we return) 9 work days Wed.
964	Sept. 20 - Leave Houston around 6:00 pm Thur.
964	Sept. 21 - Arrv.
964	London early a.m., transfer to flight to Nice - Arrv.
964	Nice around noon?
964	rent car & drive to first hotel (less than 1 hour away); collapse Fri.
964	Sept. 22 - Stay in same hotel, visit Monaco, Nice?
964	Sat.
964	Sept. 23 - Drive to St. Tropez - through Nice , Cannes & other coastal towns, check-in mid afternoon Sun.
964	Sept. 24 - St. Tropez Mon.
964	Sept. 25 - St. Tropez Tue.
964	Sept. 26 - Drive to Nice, return car, fly to Paris Wed.
964	Sept. 27 - Paris Thur.
964	Sept. 28 - Paris (Versailles or Fontainbleu - half day side trip) Fri.
964	Sept. 29 - Paris (Giverny - Monet's gardens - 3/4 day side trip) Sat.
964	Sept. 30 - Paris Sun.
964	Oct. 1 - Paris to London in afternoon - probably by Eurostar train - (arrv. London late afternoon) Mon.
964	Oct. 2 - London (meetings for CLH) Tues.
964	Oct. 3 - Fly London to Houston (lv. around noon, arrv. around
965	I will take care of it.
965	Thanks for the reminder.
966	Is there an hour or so tomorrow or Friday that Alan and I could claim to discuss the issues we teed up last week?
967	Numbers 2 and 3 still appear to be in the draft section.
968	Rick Buy asked me to chat with Sally Beck about this and apologized for not having consulted with Legal before submitting the report.
968	He indicated that the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized, at least in connection with legal documentation, as mandates.
968	Sally has been out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back in and explain the origins of these suggestions.
969	Our Credit Dept. normally handles the distribution of financial information to counterparties.
969	Tanya Rohauer has agreed to look into this.
970	Thanks for all the docs - I'll store that in a folder until they make me clean out all my files again.
970	What I really need, though is the current North America versions - which have changed since last September.
970	Does someone down there have a Word version of the current ETA and PA for NA?
971	There have not been any revisions to this version.
971	If someone else needs to receive/review, please let me or Leslie know.
972	Sorry about the delay.
973	As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might actually see it - e.g.
973	a news ticker story.
973	Simply adding it to the Legal & Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.
973	EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.
973	Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access.
974	It turns out they're talking about something completely different.
974	I can fill you in on it next time we get together.
975	You're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other counterparties.
975	I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can always ask).
975	I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by someone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.
975	It seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with rogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders decides to damage the company?
975	Having said that, I think that even without the last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and don't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they can show they weren't authorized.
976	My back office suggestion is that the master user id and password be held by the back office.
976	The master user has the ability to open and close sub-user (i.e. individual trader) user ids and passwords.
976	So if a trader leaves, the back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader.
976	They can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 5 days.
976	I suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is the disgruntled employee.
977	I'm not sure who Diana is - do you know if someone has been in contact with the COMEX and has received their permission?
978	The only changes were in the definition of Floating Price - otherwise this is the same as the "no-out" version we prepared last week.
979	Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the master agreement process at all.
979	She indicated that if she had noticed that she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to that effect now.
979	The net result is that the only change regarding financial trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk in Calgary to handle derivatives confirmations.
979	Jeff Sorensen will coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom.
980	I will be leaving at noon on August 4.
980	Please add to the calendar.
981	Any chance you can help with this?
982	Yes, I think you are right.
983	It depends on what we need it for - if it is just to get the counterparty's financials, the Credit Group has a form they can send out without legal review.
983	If there is more to it than that, you may want to check with the paralegals and see what is in the current form bank.
984	As we discussed.
985	How do you feel about this?
986	I believe I approved this yesterday.
986	If further action is required, please let me know.
987	Simon: Sorry about the delay.
987	I know we subscribe to various information services from Bloomberg and Reuters, but I am not aware of any relationship we have with Thomson Financial - then again that's not too surprising.
987	I suggest you talk to the people in investor relations and maybe the Info Central people who may have subscribed to such services.
987	The only way I would have heard about them would be if they were to be used for EnronOnline or in the highly unlikely event that they had consulted me on the subscription contracts.
987	Please feel free to call if I can be of any other help.

988	Paul: Here is the FSA letter with my comments inserted in red.
988	I have tried to make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely "arguable."
988	The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.
988	The language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC?
988	It is also a Delaware limited liability company.
988	Are we afraid it may have a I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.
988	If this has not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for them.
988	My position would be that EEFT is a party to that agreement whenever it is necessary in connection with an investment.
988	Mark
989	Is it safe to assume that a UK entity will be the Enron party for all of these transactions?
990	Thanks to the DC team - Well Done!
991	I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.
991	This included around 23 hours by PB Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).
991	Does that sound right to you?
991	I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all go to East Power Trading?
992	Please add Sara Shackleton (sara.shackleton@enron.com) from the ENA legal dept.
992	financial trading group.
993	Looks good to me.
994	I'm sorry I've been so hard to get ahold of lately.
994	Will you be available this afternoon - say around 3:30 or 4:00 (I'm pretty well booked until then).
995	Which makes it hard to call.
995	If you get this I'm at 713-853-7459 or you can e-mail back your number.
995	Sorry about that.
996	Justin: Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?
996	I was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.
996	I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.
996	Mark
997	Looks fine to me.
998	Looks good to me - don't forget the ENA Legal offsite 10/5 & 6 (it's usually over by noon on Friday - Travis could probably let you know for sure).
999	That works for me.
1000	I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....
1000	Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and just after you're born.
1000	A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in fetuses and newborns.
1000	Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps the brain develop.
1000	They must take whatever their mothers give them, either through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born.
1000	And note that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA.
1000	Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the research found.
1000	Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and mackerel.
1001	It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard of Jerry Peskuchi.
1002	Did you get this?
1002	I didn't see your name on the addressee list.
1003	Taffy - could you please reply & coordinate with the relevant people.
1004	Travis - In Phase I we had the copyright notice on every page.
1004	Can we get away with having it only on the home page?
1005	Is this OK with you?
1006	FYI
1007	It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new office that weekend.
1007	I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out your office will be included in the construction area.
1007	Phase III will probably start on the 25th.
1007	That could always slip but I wanted to give you as much notice as possible.
1007	Hope you are all doing well.
1007	Getting any sleep yet?
1008	Yes - please go ahead and forward a copy to Ed.
1008	I don't think Mark Holsworth needs to be involved in this one.
1008	Unfortunately, I don't know of anything directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time (I guess Justin coordinated that - I don't remember reading it).
1009	This may be pertinent.
1010	Looks like Justin has already contacted S&C.
1011	The whole schedule has yet to be determined.
1011	I'm still waiting for final seating charts from the other groups so I can figure out how to most efficiently get people moved into their new homes.
1011	We'll let you know as soon as possible.
1012	My only concern is the 8 hours out of date reference.
1012	As of when?
1012	It might not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being read?
1012	Would it hurt to say something to the effect of "By the time you read this" as a lead in?
1012	Are we sure that even this is accurate?
1012	How long from press run til the first copy hits the street?
1013	That works for me.
1014	I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.
1014	I reiterated that we have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.
1014	She confirmed that ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.
1014	The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our "Phil Graham card", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength for us and we should not play the card until we need to.
1014	Stacey agreed with a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill.
1014	Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the process - possibly mid September.
1015	FYI
1016	Thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.
1016	Yes we are all very sad about Jim's baby.
1016	Many years ago my sister had a child who was born two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they couldn't save him.
1016	I know how painful that was for them.
1016	And I have to admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly for you guys that first few days.
1016	I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't received the replacements yet but will ask.
1016	Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this stage.
1016	We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical stuff.
1016	We'll look forward to seeing you soon.
1017	Any progress on the EnronOnline front?
1017	I'm getting questions from the EOL team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had heard back from outside counsel.
1018	John - In case you need this right away, I've made a few changes below and this is probably adequate.
1018	If you have a little more time, I can polish it up a bit tomorrow.
1018	Just let me know.
1019	Please remove me from your distribution list.
1020	My comments are included (in section 1 only)
1021	I talked to Kathy, gave her some basic advice to relay on the subject and told her that if Alcoa has further questions they can call me.
1021	One issue for you - do you know whether or not we have a power master of some kind with Alcoa and did we need to send them an override letter?
1022	Don't forget my half-day on August 4.
1023	I had a lengthy conference call with a bunch of Milbank lawyers this afternoon to educate them on the EnronOnline structure.
1023	I received the attached message this evening - just fyi.
1024	John: Thanks for your note.
1024	Brent Hendry is now our primary weather derivatives lawyer and I am forwarding this to him.
1025	FYI
1026	The construction team has told us that your new offices will be ready some time next week.
1026	Joya will be in touch to schedule your moves into your new homes!
1027	I have reviewed the schedule and have a few questions/comments - nothing major.
1027	I have left a voice-mail for Alicia and will be happy to deal with her directly if you want.
1028	My comments marked on the attached.
1029	Dennis & Michael: It looks like this is an EnronCredit.com matter.
1029	Could you please take care of this and coordinate with David Weekes or, in his absence, Gillian Johnson (in Houston).
1029	Thanks for your help!
1029	Mark
1030	Elaine: Please coordinate with the legal department in London on these issues.
1030	They are familiar with arranging for Enron Corp. guaranties.
1030	Mark
1031	Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.
1031	It is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to Australian power products.
1031	You probably already know that the EnronOnline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.
1031	Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.
1031	Unfortunately, that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.
1031	It sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would be a total pain but certainly possible).
1031	On the other hand, if you feel comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties without that test being performed, we can do that, too.
1031	Pleas let me know if we should ask Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be limited to Australian entities.
1032	Congratulations!
1032	We'll have to chat soon.
1033	This is the message I received - I note that it doesn't give any instructions on how to access the site - seems to me a hyperlink would be appropriate.
1034	I have now registered but have not yet entered my key to gain access to the deal.
1035	Let's get together & discuss early next week.
1036	The revised draft looks good to me.
1037	Congratulations Jeff!
1037	And great pictures - big brother looks a bit happier than the last time I saw him.
1037	Mark
1038	We should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so that we can determine appropriate attendees and get it on their calendars.
1038	Do you have anything in particular in mind?
1038	Were you thinking Hope you're having a fun weekend!
1039	Can you please arrange EnronOnline guest user IDs for the following people (these are lawyers at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy helping on EnronOnline issues): Daniel Mummery dmummery@milbank.com Eric Sanford esanford@milbank.com Steven Kramer skramer@milbank.com Let me know if you need any other details.
1039	Thanks, Mark
1040	Hey guys - welcome home!
1040	At least I assume you're home by now.
1040	How was the trip?
1040	I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have gotten better.
1040	Any hope you took digital pictures?
1040	I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought your wedding was.
1040	There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.
1040	Magical doesn't seem like too strong a word.
1040	Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.
1040	It's been about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see why you enjoy it so much.
1040	I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.
1040	If you are still interested, we really need to start planning right away.
1040	I tentatively booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a busy travel season.
1040	Just let me know.
1040	Mark
1041	This was one of your competitors - at least from the legal side - that we looked at briefly about a year ago.
1042	Glad to hear the rest of your trip went well.
1042	The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.
1042	In an effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.
1042	Because of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.
1042	You could do a shorter trip, of course, but I never have.
1042	I've gone for longer (we did a 10 day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long trip and certainly not necessary.
1042	Most of the charter fleets are based where there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.
1042	One of the reasons for aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days spent.
1042	I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.
1042	I haven't taken all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that works better for you guys.
1042	My views on when to go: January - March Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded (harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.
1042	April - May Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.
1042	June - August No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.
1042	September - October See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes ( My guess is that people who planned their trips to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got GREAT deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund. I've chartered during this period several times and had a blast. One time a tropical storm came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of the stories. You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat back and let them deal with it). November - December Hurricane threat drops dramatically. Crowds pick up around Christmas, everything opens up again, rates start to go up again. Bottom line: I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - just let me know what works best for you guys. Keep in mind that you do have to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make sure you get flights and the boat that you want. One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to pick someone up. This is definitely suboptimal. You learn a lot about the boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain or wherever. I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once but if it's the only way, at least it's an option. Mark
1043	I'm not sure what your question is - the purpose is so they can see the site.......
1044	Laura: I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.
1044	The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal graphics involved) is to have it in a form I can just print out.
1044	If it exists as a Word document that would be great.
1044	I have not yet actually been able to see the phase 2 site.
1044	Thanks, Mark
1045	I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.
1045	I'm assuming that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade.
1046	Dear John: So sorry for the delay.
1046	I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.
1046	I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have your phone number!
1046	Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent: Part 1 (b) In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.
1046	To accomplish this in the schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly.
1046	Part 1 (d) Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?
1046	We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.
1046	The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it.
1046	In the U.S. the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.
1046	Part 1 (e) We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility.
1046	Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature.
1046	However, in many of the markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).
1046	Part 1 (h)(ix) This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex.
1046	When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position.
1046	If the party fails, it then becomes a default allowing termination.
1046	Part 1 (h)(x) Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen?
1046	Part 2 Have our internal Tax people approved this?
1046	Part 3 I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to.
1046	Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?
1046	The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary.
1046	In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents, etc. Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).
1046	If neither party is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.
1046	On the other hand, since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well.
1046	If that is our theory, there are additional representations (the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back in. Part 5 (d) We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.
1046	While I think we will get there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.
1046	So far I guess we leave it the way it is.
1046	Part 5 (j) My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.
1046	Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about?
1046	Paragraph 13 I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule.
1046	My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form.
1046	It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.
1046	The way it is drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.
1046	The counterparty doesn't have to worry about Moody's at all.
1046	Just a thought.
1046	On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.
1046	My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra $5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded.
1046	Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form.
1046	I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.
1046	I hope this is helpful.
1046	Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful.
1046	We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward.
1046	It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.
1046	It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things.
1046	We're looking forward to having you back.
1047	Dave - my comments are below in red.
1047	I'm assuming that "end of the day" is the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, etc. Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the day and then reactivates it?

1061	Sounds reasonable to me.
1062	When I try to search offers I get the following error message: The DBAccess Componet is NOT Installed.
1062	Please contact the system administrator.
1063	Leonardo - Dave asked me the same questions last night when we were talking about a different issue.
1063	Will that do for this week?
1064	Carol - I would really like to come but unfortunately I will be leaving on vacation (to France) on the 20th and won't be back until October.
1064	I hear you will be at the offsite but is there any chance we'll get a visit up here before then?
1065	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!
1066	Approved re: monitor.
1066	What is our policy on printers for lawyers?
1066	I know a number of people (including me) have them but I don't know how that happens.
1067	Here is the current list of countries (as per advice received today from UK counsel): Approved: UK Germany Austria Switzerland Finland Portugal Poland Approved if prizes are not awarded: Netherlands Norway Sweden Italy Not Approved under any circumstances: Denmark Spain France
1068	Yes, Mary is still in 3807.
1068	Is the printer you mentioned the smallest/cheapest one we can get?
1069	FYI
1070	Yes, thanks - these are mine.
1071	The commercial guys have asked me for an update on where we stand with BP.
1071	Any news?
1072	I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's reply.
1072	I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year, etc. I haven't heard anything from Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.
1072	Have you heard anything firm from Virginia?
1072	Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday.
1072	The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule, too.
1072	If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans soon - that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.
1072	If you'd rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.
1072	Just let me know.
1073	I have no idea since I never read the original - I just thought it was an interesting approach to take when making a modification.
1074	I don't think I have any problems with this presentation - but can you give me an idea of the proposed audience?
1075	Wow - too many choices.
1075	Let's see, the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it.
1075	We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.
1075	It's much harder to get there from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get there.
1075	The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through Wed.
1075	- not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose - it just means a 4 day instead of 7 day charter.
1075	If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).
1075	Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!
1075	What would you think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?
1075	That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later.
1075	I have a couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger group.
1075	They're a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors too!
1076	We were working on Brazil (Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo was heading it up) but I think they have stopped for now.
1076	I'll look for her latest e-mail and forward it to you.
1076	The others are all new.
1076	Tana can give you the form of local counsel survey we have been using if you want it.
1077	I haven't read this yet.
1078	Here is the confirm with my revisions:
1079	Please discard the version I sent a few minutes ago.
1079	Here is a clean copy with one additional change and a marked copy to show all of the changes from the original:
1080	Can you let me know who at BP in London is holding things up?
1080	Larry Gagliardi here in Houston has asked so he can give the name to his counterpart in the US.
1081	Nice try, but no.
1082	First choice: New Years if Bill & Amanda can get the first week of 2001 off.
1082	Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there.
1082	Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving.
1082	I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might work if nothing else does.
1083	I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and itlooks like he's going to insist on the CSA.
1083	We are going to talk tomorrowand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.
1083	While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.
1083	Manyof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.
1083	It would behelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a Following are my points responsive to their revisions: Part 1 (a) The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding thepossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcythis agreement would be in default).
1083	(g) This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit riskto the other party.
1083	It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate areason to remove it.
1083	Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.
1083	Our original version spellsout exactly what is expected of the parties.
1083	If the documents we listed arnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if weagree we will put it in the agreement.
1083	Part 4 (f) By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying thapayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have tomake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to opayment).
1083	This is not acceptable.
1083	(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or EPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement.
1083	Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should behonored.
1083	(c) The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the samecity.
1083	For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.
1083	(e) The change to 10 business days is much too long.
1083	This means we can nohave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!
1083	We can goas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice.
1083	(g) Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed tmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with eachIBJ branch as a separate entity.
1083	This may not be an issue if we will nevertrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if wewill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.
1083	We usually don't liketo restrict ourselves that way.
1083	(i) We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.
1083	Ifthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it buwholesale deletion is out of the question.
1083	(j) As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties whilemaintaining flexibility within the corporate family.
1083	Given the frequencywith which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section isimportant to us.
1083	(k) This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty thawent into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money.
1083	We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without orevision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathehigh rate given their status as a bankrupt.
1083	We feel the non-default rate imore appropriate.
1083	(m) I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it protects us both.
1083	(n) You know more about this than I. Part 6 These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason.
1083	If these provisioare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (asignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)and we need to know now if they object to any of them.
1083	Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.
1083	I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.
1083	I'm happy to discusany of these issues at greater length if you want.
1083	It sounds to me like IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given thvolume and nature of their comments.
1083	To: Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Tom- As far as the progress on the ISDA documentation, I am awaiting feedback frboth legal and credit in Houston.
1083	Could you provide me with the details of the proposed transaction(s).
1083	I nothat I have copied Mark Taylor on this correspondence, as I will need to gehis input regarding our most efficient going forward strategy.
1083	Thanks, John To: John Viverito/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Jonathan.Whitehead@enron.com, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John I have just had IBJ on the phone again asking for a progress report on theISDA docs.
1083	Have we managed to move this forward, bearing in mind Labour Dasince he is very keen to commence trading on Monday next.
1083	He suggested thahe would be comfortable in trading prior to the implementation of the docsfor these initial trades as per Jonathon's previous comments in past mails.Are we comfortable doing this if we cannot resolve the issues on the docs?
1083	They are also very keen to see the draft confirms for the proposed trade (Steve, I have just heard from Rob in the vid conf that the proposed volumemay prove difficult to take on the books??).
1083	Please advise as to our capability so that I can convey this to him in the morning.
1083	Best regards Tom
1084	Agreed.
1085	Good catch.
1085	NY law should apply throughout the Americas and in Japan.
1085	We used UK law in Europe and Singapore on the theory the counterparties there would be more comfortable with Uk law.
1085	I'm not sure which the Australians would prefer.
1085	What do you think of the following: 16.
1085	If you are accessing this website from North America, South America or Japan, the terms of this legal and Privacy statement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York; if you are accessing this website from any other location, its terms shall be governed by English law.
1086	Just a few comments on the letter:
1087	Thursday and Friday are filling up fast for me but the early part of the week looks pretty good.
1087	Let me know what works for your schedule.
1088	How about 3:00 Wednesday?
1089	The Sales Practices/Anti-Manipulation Training program covers the legal implications of various activities of our commercial team ) particularly as they interact with customers in marketing (Sales Practices).
1089	The programalso covers laws prohibiting market manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.
1090	We can use my office if you like - EB3889.
1091	Ken - what is the significance of "physical" below?
1091	Hopefully as distinct from financial and not as distinct from derivatives.
1092	The latest PA is online.
1092	I have printed out a copy of the current version and sent it to Alan.
1093	Is there some way to ensure that the user reads this?
1093	Do they have to click on it before it will go away or does it appear in a pop-up box that has to be acknowledged?
1094	Approved.
1095	Is this something you are working on?
1096	Go for it.
1096	That is shaping up to be the kind of day we may cancel the group meeting any way - my first day back after vacation and everybody trying to get lots done so we can get away to the Woodlands.
1096	Be sure to let Taffy know so she can put it on the calendar.
1097	I'm not sure if you handle NYMEX margin issues or not....
1098	Welcome Back!
1098	Looks like BP has finally signed.
1098	As I understand it, this should open the way to get them signed up in the U.S.
1099	Just FYI, I think the EnronOnline decision was to leave the User ID off of the Password Application as a security measure.
1099	The User ID is sent separately (I think in a security envelope) so that the User ID and password are never written down in the same place.
1099	And of course the system requires that the password be changed the first time the new user logs on so the Enron file copy of the PA won't give access to a user's valid password.
1100	Approved.
1101	Amanda, Thanks for your note.
1101	It looks to me like the schedule breaks down as follows: Possible Date: October 12 - 15 My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for its great sailing) Possible Date: November 3 - 8 My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that (makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go Possible Date: Thanksgiving My Reaction: You guys can't make it Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the office Mon. 1/8/01) My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet) Possible Date: Later in 2001 My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a second choice.
1101	If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 2001 when Bill can go we can do that, too.
1101	What are you guys thinking?
1101	Since we won't be going at Thanksgiving, how are you going to talk your mom into dealing with the holiday?
1101	Mark
1102	FYI
1103	I've been to Argentina - what can I tell you about it?
1103	We need to get sailing soon!
1103	Ever get to Houston?
1103	I have a boat here but don't sail too much - just working too hard.
1103	Hope you're well!
1104	Party A,s obligations under this transaction are subject to approval by its Chief Operating Officer.
1105	I will not be able to attend this afternoon's call.
1106	Just a reminder I'm off to the ball game tonight.
1107	Taffy - please print this for Ken to take away with him today.
1108	I have read about the Super Maramu 2000 and note from your website that you have a location on the Mediterranean in France.
1108	I will be in Southern France September 23 through 25.
1108	Would it be possible to visit you in Hyeres during that time?
1108	Is an appointment necessary?
1108	Mark Taylor 1322 Rutland Street Houston, Texas 77008 (713)863-7190 (home) (713)853-7459 (work) (713)646-3490 (fax)
1109	Since I will be leaving tomorrow, it might make sense to put reviewing this towards the top of your list so I can approve it in the computer before I leave.
1110	Keith: Please coordinate with Susan Bailey who can take care of the details for you.
1110	Mark
1111	Dear Mr. Barathon, Thank you for your very quick reply.
1111	There will only be two of us and we would like to come to see the boat but unfortunately we will not have time to spend the day sailing.
1111	We will be staying in St. Tropez at Residence de la Regards, Mark Taylor
1112	Steve: I have now heard back from both Louise and Andy and neither one will be available.
1112	Unfortunately, Mark has now left again and I am on my way out on vacation for a couple of weeks.
1112	It might make sense for you to contact Mark directly since you will be able to get to him before I can.
1112	Sorry about that.
1112	Mark
1113	As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the next to be demolished & reconstructed.
1113	While the current timetable is not firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA offsite).
1113	I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could begin the packing process.
1113	Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will schedule the actual move.
1114	Your new offices will be ready in a week or so.
1114	We anticipate your moves will take place over the weekend of September 29.
1114	Joy Davis will coordinate your moves and can help with obtaining boxes, etc.
1115	Sorry - forgot to cc you on this one.
1116	FYI
1117	For emergency use: Residence de la Pinede 41 Buckingham Palace Road
1118	Marc - Bummer - this is the last message I'm sending and then I'm out the door for the airport.
1118	We're on our way to France - not back until 10/4.
1118	Mark
1119	Tanya - I just got back from vacation to find this waiting.
1119	Do we need to do anything?
1119	Mark
1120	Thanks for all of the recent forwarded messages - they have all been mine.
1120	Sorry for not getting back to you sooner but I've been out of town.
1121	Any hope of a time for Lisa?
1121	Please get in touch with her and let her know the situation.
1122	These don't look complete to me - e.g.
1122	Contractual Currency, Index definition, Volume reference.
1123	Thanks for the note - I'll be there.
1124	Did you have a chance to talk to Lisa?
1125	Sheri - I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).
1125	It sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?
1125	Mark
1126	Just wanted to make sure you had this.
1127	Looks good to me.
1128	Please call this person and let them know I am not going.
1129	Please order a flat screen monitor for me.
1130	Thanks for your note.
1130	Your e-mail trouble is due to the spelling of Tana's name - should only be one 'n.' I am forwarding this on to her.
1130	Mark
1131	All of these should now use EnronOnline, not ENA.
1132	Justin: Do you know what other business MG London Inc. is or anticipates doing with these same counterparties?
1132	It may make a difference if they are acting for these customers as an FCM.
1132	Mark
1133	Probably should add Mark Evans for London generally.
1133	Matt Lee for Singapore?
1134	We should get together with the right tax person/people - maybe Jeff can figure this out.
1135	Janette - Here is the report with my changes - I have not been able to find Travis or Anne to see what changes if any they would like to add but will let you know when I hear from them.
1135	Mark T.
1136	I'd be happy to take them if they're available.
1137	Mike - I have trouble getting some of the e-mails sent to me from Buenos Aires but not all.
1137	I received this one from you today, one on the 9th and one on Sept. If the internal address doesn't seem to work, you should probably use Mark
1138	Greg, Here is the ETA version in my directory.
1138	I think a few minor changes may have been made (e.g. EnronOnline LLC is now the Enron party) and the definitive version is on the website.
1138	You can access it there if you have a guest user ID.
1138	If you need an ID, just let me know and we'll have the EOL people issue one for you.
1138	I'm also attaching an early version of the Password Application (current versions also online and accessible even without an ID) since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the ETA.
1138	I usually think of the two pieces as one agreement.
1138	Mark
1139	Looks good to me - sorry I've been so hard to get ahold of.
1139	Mark
1140	Sorry about that - the request came while I was out of town and I missed it - have now approved.
1141	I will be in the office all week - how about 10:00 a.m. Houston time on Thursday?
1141	Mark
1142	Greg: Here are my comments to the first of the Long Descriptions.
1142	I was afraid I might be missing something about the way you guys do these deals in Canada so I thought I would run this one by you first to make sure I had the concepts right before I tackle the rest of them.
1142	Thanks, Mark
1143	Oops - forgot the attachment:
1144	Can you reply to Justin & let him know where we stand?
1145	Initial thoughts - Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron Japan?
1145	Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word "ordinary" or maybe the entire phrase "in the ordinary course of its business"?
1145	Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or "no action" type of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?
1145	It may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.
1145	If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.
1145	If necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal sanctions issue to Mark H. (What are the potential sanctions?)
1146	Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to have access to these products?
1146	The general rule has been to allow complete access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to trade what doesn't seem to enter into it.
1147	Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions.
1148	Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place) This is the index language for EnronOnline.
1148	We would use something similar for the offline confirms.
1149	I got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the Senator's staff before sending the letter.
1149	It would be embarrassing to suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us.
1149	Re: the letter itself, if you want to make it even stronger, you could point out in your discussion of EnronOnline that we believe that the site could have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill.
1150	Here are my revisions.
1150	Let me know if you have any questions.
1151	You can remove me from the distribution list.
1152	Thanks for the resume - I'm looking at a number of internal candidates from APACHI, CALME and Southern Cone but will keep this one on file (and pass it along - might be good for Richard Sanders).
1153	My impression is that this now being handled in Global Finance.
1153	You might try Jordan Mintz or Gareth Bahlmann.
1154	Here's the financial trading piece - I may not have all of the formats quite right.
1155	just a couple of minor changes - what is the last sentence about?
1156	Thanks Dale - looks good to me.
1157	Yes, I'll take the call.
1158	This one should go to the crude traders.
1159	Mark Haedicke has asked me to submit a list of our "top ten legal risks" - please let me know of anything you think should be included in the list.
1160	FYI
1161	Yes, thanks.
1162	Yes - as I understand it, Stephanie and Tana will be out that week but Samantha and Susan will be here.
1163	I have volunteered for Nov 3/4.
1164	Here it is.
1165	My answers below in red.
1166	The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.
1166	For instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.
1166	The index language can be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of trade you are doing.
1166	But I thought you guys had decided to use the first price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire month language attached so this may not be the final version.
1167	Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.
1167	They were by far the best around and it's a real shame.
1167	There is a PLI course being offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.
1167	Neither is anywhere near as good as the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.
1168	yep - thanks!
1169	Dale - better check your address book - this one went to the other Mark Taylor.
1170	I'm not sure if you guys are on this mail list but here is the most recent message from Stacey at ISDA.
1171	Agreed - can you please confirm directly with Erica that Tax has no problem with Enron Credit.com contracts being signed in the US.
1172	Please print this out and put a copy in our file for Colombian trading (Tana may know where that should be).
1173	Please print these out for me, create a file for them called EnronOnline Pipeline Capacity and bring it to me.
1174	Thank you!
1175	I have confirmed with Mark Holsworth that he is the right guy for this - he has a form agreement that Enron uses for these situations.
1176	Would you guys please take a look at this and let me know if I can approve it in the system?
1176	Thanks
1177	yes, I think that's the idea.
1177	You may need to monitor and advise.
1178	Bob: Here is a powerpoint presentation that may give you a bit of a feel for the site and actually has a couple of slides on the submission screens that will show areas not accessible with a guest user ID.
1178	Mark
1179	Kathy: Please issue a guest user id to Bob Lawrence at Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy.
1179	Bob is a lawyer helping us with various EnronOnline matters including Broker Connect.
1179	His e-mail address is rlawrence@milbank.com.
1179	Thanks, Mark
1180	John - what about something like this?
1181	Sami - apologies for not getting back to you - it's been a crazy week or two.
1181	Can we talk early next week?
1182	works for me
1183	I won't be able to be on the 11:30 call this morning.
1183	I have given Elizabeth a copy of the 'omnibus' document we probably used if the put options sold to Puget Sound were derivatives and described the arguments we could make that the imposition of the proposed price cap would be a Market Disruption Event.
1183	If it is a Market Disruption Event the most likely outcome under the contract (since it will last more than 3 days and we presumably will not be able to negotiate an agreed price) is that "the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by ENA, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."
1183	I'm not sure what dealer quotes would get us under these circumstances.
1183	Can dealers quote prices in excess of the price cap?
1184	Just a few changes below.
1185	Janette: This may be more than you were looking for - let me know if you want me to pare it down a bit.
1185	I assume we will have the opportunity to revise these as time goes on......

1185	The group coordinates the legal approval process for granting customer access to EnronOnline.
1186	Sorry about the delay.
1187	Please be sure to access the performance review system as soon as possible to select persons to contribute to your review.
1187	While commercial people are particularly helpful, you may select reviewers at any level.
1188	Thought you might like this.
1189	I will be happy to attend but do have a regular 9:00 meeting on Fridays.
1190	I want to underscore that moving just the banking stuff to a bill to pass this year is VERY bad and something we should vehemently oppose.
1191	Craig: Sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier.
1191	I asked Tana Jones to get you access to our database that keeps track of financial master agreement negotiations so you will always be up to date on where we stand with the process.
1191	If you haven't heard from her, please let me know.
1191	Any word from Justin on which Enron entity we will use for trading in the U.S.?
1191	Mark
1192	Had a lengthy call with Milbank on Friday and another scheduled for this afternoon at 4:00 to find out how they're doing.
1193	I should be around all week - let me know what works for you.
1194	FYI
1195	Looks good to me.
1195	Brent is the only other lawyer out that day.
1196	Carol: Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.
1196	I'd love to have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).
1196	We do have a lot to catch up on (EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.
1196	Mark
1197	I enjoyed it too - actually it's just as well that I was carted off when I was - I was sound asleep by 8:30 and still feel the affects.
1198	It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty should have known it was a mistake).
1198	I'm afraid we've just been lucky that the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is too close to call obvious.
1199	Mark Haedicke is on the left, Mark Frevert (Chairman of the wholesale markets subsidiaries) on the right.
1199	Yours truly, et al
1200	My changes marked.
1201	Please use the PEP system on your computer to suggest reviewers by the end of the day tomorrow at the latest.
1201	It is important that your reviewers have enough time to fill out the reviews and the system closes for that purpose at the end of next week.
1201	If you have any questions or are having trouble accessing the system, please let me know.
1202	Here is the MEH e-mail I mentioned
1203	My comments are marked on the attached.
1204	Bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that rather than creating a separate GTC for the brokers we refer to the GTCs already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the deal falls through.
1205	Thanks David - these are fine.
1206	Thanks for your concern but please don't worry about it.
1206	I was able to get a lot accomplished since I was already here and the phones weren't ringing so it was a productive morning for me in any event.
1206	I don't think I'm available for any of the remaining Saturdays this year but I'll give it another shot next time.
1207	Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.
1207	My only comments would be (i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual matter.
1207	I agree about Tana.
1207	Mark
1208	Yes, I was on the call.
1209	Nothing has changed - we are looking forward to having you work with us as soon as possible and to the extent possible within your other constraints.
1210	This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities, interest rates and currencies.
1210	The older versions of the policy provided that no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyoneother than Enron.
1210	Beyond that, no Enron employee could trade a commoditywhich was within their area of responsibility.
1210	For example, I was not permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but, since interest rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility, I could tradthem.
1210	As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more difficult to identify the scope of the company's concern, much less to articulate it.
1210	We did however take a stab at it and the result is below.
1210	This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versioof the Policy.
1210	For now, I would suggest that the term "security" highlighted below should be read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered ithe second numbered clause (i.e. the word "other" refers to items other thathose listed in clause (i)).
1210	The result is that an Enron employee who doesnot trade financial instruments, securities, financial assets or liabilitiefor Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account.
1210	To take this a step further, one could argue that an employee who trades the equities ofenergy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for hisor her own account but could trade other equities - if it were me, I wouldcertainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did itOf course, a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for personal trading - metals, ag commodities, bandwidth, freight, lumber, amonmany others - for all employees.
1210	As I remember it, this was done purposelyand if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise todiscuss the matter with the RAC Group as they make suggestions for Policyrevisions to the Enron Corp. board.
1210	Employee Trading.
1210	No employee of any Enron Business Unit may engage in thetrading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Business Unit (whether for their own account or for the account of any thirparty) where such Position relates to (i) any financial instrument, securitfinancial asset or liability which falls within such employee,s responsibility at an Enron Business Unit or (ii) any other commodity, included in any Commodity Group.
1210	To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: David Redmond/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Peter
1211	I accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement
1212	I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and they have given you 3882, just four doors down the hall from where I am now.
1212	The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by and see it.
1213	Unfortunately I'm already booked for breakfast (which is unusual for me).
1213	I'm free for lunch though on both days if you are.
1214	I'm going to be hard to get next week - Monday & Tuesday I'll be in NYC (speaking at a conference), Wed.
1214	a.m. in the office and the rest of the week at the management conference.
1214	If it works for you, any time the following week (20, 21 or 22) would be better for me.
1214	If it is urgent, let me know and I will try to break from my meetings during the day on Mon., Tues.
1214	afternoon or maybe Wed.
1214	(but since that's the only time I'll be in the office all week it's already pretty full).
1214	Just let me know - my assistant (Taffy x57373) can set something up on my calendar if you have a time you want to reserve.
1215	Lunch on Monday would be great - anything in particular in mind?
1216	I'm speaking at a conference in ny again but never got around to making any plans - any chance you're free?
1217	Hello from Texas.
1217	It's probably been about six years since we last spoke but I thought I'd drop you a line to see how you were doing.
1217	I saw Pete Datos for brunch when I was in town a couple of years ago and he seemed to be fine but I have been very bad about staying in touch with people.
1217	Ted Bockius & I are still together - he works at an internet start-up company doing their public relations work.
1217	I'm still a corporate lawyer at Enron working on financial contracts and e-commerce stuff.
1217	I get to nyc 3 or 4 times a year so we should get together for a drink or a meal some time and catch up.
1217	Hope you are well.
1217	Mark
1218	I'll be at the Peninsula (55th & 5th) (212)956-2888.
1218	I will have my cell phone but no guarantees that the battery will last (713)206-8080.
1218	Either of the places you mentioned would be fine with me - my conference is at the PLI Center (on 7th around 51st or 52nd).
1218	Just tell me when & where!
1219	I concur in David's analysis.
1219	Any idea who the target market is in HK?
1219	If we have specific customers in mind, would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available?
1219	It's not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted HK residents, just not the public.
1220	Wednesday morning is the only time I will be in the office all week and is already fully booked.
1220	Will you be in San Antonia later?
1220	Maybe we can meet then.
1221	I'm staying at the Peninsula 956-2888.
1221	I can't stay out late tonight because my talk is in the morning - what about lunch tomorrow?
1222	The system won't let me connect to approve your reviewers from outside the office.
1222	I'll do it first thing Wednesday morning but since they'll only have 2 days left to fill out the forms at that point, if there are any you particularly want, I suggest you call or e-mail them to let them know it is coming.
1223	Taffy - please print this out for the EnronOnline file.
1224	Unfortunately I am already booked for Wednesday.
1224	To: Jeffrey E Sommers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark cc: Subject: Argentina Gentlemen, Following Mike Guerriero%s e.mail.
1224	Could you please let me know if there is any chance of each one of you meeting with him for 45%on Wednesday Nov. morning?
1224	Thanks
1225	What a great poem!
1225	Sorry for the confusion on getting together - I'll try to start earlier next time.
1226	Have you guys seen this?
1227	Bob - These are the only versions I have in Word format - they were probably modified slightly in the online version (e.g. Enron party is now EnronOnline
1228	Thanks for your note - that will make packing easier.
1228	My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.
1228	I don't like to take those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop flight.
1228	It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to lose your luggage.
1229	Please send a copy of the Energy Gateway docs to Luis Derrota - EB838.
1230	If they've done it, it was without consulting me.
1230	Other than the content stuff (e.g. which provide links to Reuters) I don't think there is anything out there yet.
1231	This just came in - I think Brad is the lead commercial guy on the project.
1232	It's possible that someone in Alan Aronowitz's groups has looked into similar issues.
1233	Please let me know when the vaccine is available.
1234	We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term Capital Management debacle of last year.
1234	These same issues may not apply in the UK.
1235	Here is the first draft.
1236	Yes, I'd like the tickets if they're available.
1237	I don't know if this will be helpful or not....
1238	Glad you liked it.
1238	There is a while series of e-mail symbols people use like smiley faces - they even have a name: emoticons.
1238	They don't often look like you'd expect and most of them are sideways - only one I know is the smiley face :-) Hope you had a nice birthday!
1238	Love , Mark
1239	Let me know if this is not what you need.
1240	I'll be there.
1241	I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request.
1241	Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far in advance we need to schedule the churn.
1241	The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is done) will be put in the cubes we have.
1241	When we run out of cubes we have space to build more.
1242	Here is the revised BETA - let me know what you think.
1242	The changes are marked in blue.
1243	Here is the BETA with our initial comments.
1244	As we discussed a couple of weeks ago......
1245	Can one of you guys handle this in Stacy's absence?
1246	Does this raise uncertainty for products offered by non-banks?
1247	This looks ok to me.
1248	These look OK to me.
1249	FYI
1250	Peter: Here is our first attempt at EnronOnline Long Description language for the double transaction calendar spread product.
1250	We had to guess at several aspects.
1250	Please let me know if we got close.
1250	Mark
1251	Thanks so much for the Christmas present.
1251	Everyone is enjoying it very much.
1251	Bob Bruce's first reaction was "Wow -- I hope this isn't in lieu of her ever coming back!"
1252	So now it's clear?
1253	I thought I'd send this around just as a reminder of the RMT guidelines.
1253	As far as I know these have not changed since Rhett's memo last year.
1254	Approved.
1255	Thanks for your notes.
1255	Just so you know, I have the Polo Sport perfume and a Victoria's Secret gift certificate for Emily.
1255	Were there lists for you and Dad?
1255	I can't seem to find them.
1256	My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think?
1257	Maybe we can chat about this first draft this afternoon.
1258	With my revisions.
1259	This confirmation should have the regular Omnibus Annex A attached as well as the additional Chilean Annex which Tana forwarded last week.
1259	Please call me if you have any questions.
1259	Mark
1260	In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a slightly revised version.
1260	Also attached is a revised BETA.
1260	The changes marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).
1260	Unfortunately I didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked.
1261	Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.
1261	The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.
1261	That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere.
1261	The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.
1261	About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.
1261	There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.
1261	Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.
1261	[In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.
1261	Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.
1261	The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.
1261	Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons).
1261	Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot.
1261	Mark
1262	Hi Debbie: Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!
1262	I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy company (Enron).
1262	I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce which is relatively new.
1262	The most fun work project I've had was being the lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading platform about a year ago.
1262	It has been tremendously successful.
1262	While few people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in the world!
1262	I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international mutual funds in New York.
1262	My work takes me there several times a year and I usually try to see him if I have some free time.
1262	The college is thinking about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).
1262	Ralph V. was there - whom I hadn't seen in years!
1262	- and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.
1262	I was on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.
1262	There were only 2 of us from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see familiar faculty faces.
1262	With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.
1262	My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a terrible commute.
1262	I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.
1262	I rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me know if you ever make it down this way.
1262	Mark
1263	Sure - it's not secret.
1264	Generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there were separate legal entities involved (like getting a comfort letter or guaranty from EI when ECT had to do the swap for one of their deals).
1264	I think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides.
1265	Did you get this?
1266	Peter - Should Tana add you to her list of people who get the daily EnronOnline customer list?
1266	She sends it out to several lawyers to see if there is any reason not to give access to the system.
1266	Mark
1267	Thanks for the e-mail - I tried to go in and update my info but the system is down and will be down all weekend.
1267	Is Monday early enough?
1268	Thanks for the number.
1268	I did not get the cooking set for Elena - I ordered the bongo drum.
1269	I spoke with Justin briefly this morning - he wants to look into this and get back to me.
1270	Thanks!
1271	Thanks - I've asked Sara to give him a call now, too.
1272	I am on Continental Express Flight 4100 from Houston to Cincinnati Depart: Houston (IAH), 23-Dec-00 at 11:00 AM Arrive: Cincinnati (CVG), 23-Dec-00 at 2:26 PM My flight on Tuesday is the same as at Thanksgiving: leaving Cincinnati at If picking me up is a problem, just let me know and I can try to rent a car.
1273	I'll be in Cincinnati, OH and then traveling back to Houston on Tues.
1273	You can reach me at (513)541-8649 or on my cell phone (713)206-8080.
1274	Denis: Try Deb Korkmas at 713-853-5448.
1274	Happy Holidays!
1274	Mark
1275	Thanks Mark.
1275	I think this one went to a whole lot of people - I can't tell if it was on purpose or a mistake!
1276	Is there a retail location in Houston, TX where I can find an AF3.0HD?
1276	Thanks, Mark Taylor (713)853-7459 (office) (713)863-7190 (home) (713)646-3490 (fax)
1277	Yes, I think we were ok with the base language - it was just those last issues we were waiting on.
1278	Why don't you come in Saturday night & I'll take you to dinner?
1279	I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white #A32027) from Talbots.
1279	It was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the stores.
1279	I did not get the towels.
1279	Glad the computer is working better for you.
1279	It makes all the difference in the world to have it speed up.
1279	For me it actually becomes more useful since I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to happen.
1279	My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.
1279	I wonder if people grow them outdoors when the weather warms up.
1279	The smell might work better with more room to disperse.
1279	This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I can stand it!
1279	Love, Mark
1280	That's fine.
1280	We don't keep particularly careful track of these things but pretty much estimate the percentages on a quarterly basis.
1281	Just so you can see what is happening.....
1282	Looks good to me.
1283	Do you know if Enron is trying to have any input in the selection process?
1284	I think this will do for now.
1284	Thanks
1285	Sounds good to me.
1286	I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!
1286	I don't remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.
1286	Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.
1286	There's really no way I can get away next week.
1286	I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't know about the evian spritzing.
1286	Maybe next time.
1286	Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?
1286	I could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister......
1287	That's a great idea - I'll see if I can line up a boat - anywhere in particular you'd like to sail?
1287	(BVI makes sense if there's a newcomer along.) Where do you fly into to get to Charlottesville?
1288	I'll definitely take the room.
1288	How (and when) do you plan to get there?
1288	Do you rent a car in DC and drive or fly into Charlottesville?
1289	Approved.
1290	We can try - an we'll ask the planners to put that in the design.
1290	But Mark H. has indicated a desire to get rid of as many of the tall walls as possible and he approves all of the construction requests personally, so we may not succeed.
1291	Approved.
1292	As per our telephone call.
1293	Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit?
1294	Seems to me that L/C's are the way to go then, rather than asking for cash or another asset as collateral.
1294	(Another option would be to mix and match - taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.) Lenders frequently set up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control over how much "debt" is supported by the asset base while still giving the borrower some flexibility.
1294	As you can imagine, most other extenders of credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.
1295	Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

1297	Nora - I got your voice mail & will try to call you soon - I'm stuck on a conference call.
1297	I tend to agree with you - this seems to me to be contrary to our policy.
1297	On the other hand, it also sounds like a request we would want to make if we were on the other side.
1298	Sorry Andrea - I just tried to open this and it turns out to be the Spanish version.
1299	Thanks for the update - the fax came in and was delivered to Jeff Hodge by mistake - I'll leave it at your desk.
1300	Here are some early drafts I worked on.
1301	Re: assistant searches, I think you would be well advised to coordinate closely with Janette Elbertson.
1302	I have a conflict with the Friday morning call this week.
1302	Any chance you will be covering it?
1302	I know you guys are busy this week.....
1303	I'll let you know when I figure out what our Firm ID and Password are.
1304	I just heard that there is a farewell party for Rainer on Friday afternoon - don't know any details.
1305	Ohmygawd!
1305	An e-mail message from Hal!
1305	Now I know we really ARE in the 21st century.
1305	I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.
1305	Ted will get there Friday eve.
1305	I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat.
1305	morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.
1305	Otherwise I don't think we have specific plans.
1305	Looking forward to it!
1305	Mark
1306	Sounds good to me - let's say dinner on Thursday and then either lunch or dinner - your choice - including Ted on Saturday.
1306	We have no plans at all so far so we're flexible.
1306	Mark
1307	Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation after it is executed.
1307	There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a patch-work of policies created by the operating units.
1307	Tana and I would be happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind.
1308	Linda said she had an extra room booked - do I need to call the hotel directly or work through Linda?
1309	Peter Welcome to Enron!
1309	I usually get to the London office a couple of times a year and will look forward to meeting you there.
1309	If not, hopefully we'll see you at the Law Conference in the Spring.
1309	Most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise.
1309	Are you consulting me regarding the regulatory issues and section 10.2?
1309	If so, it would help if you told me what 10.2 says.....
1309	Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.
1309	Mark
1310	Hey Jim, Thanks for the note.
1310	Nothing much new to report here.
1310	Ted was in South Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.
1310	He's still trying to talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out what I really want.
1310	I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the continent that's warm.
1310	Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.
1310	Let us know when you find a place to live Mark
1311	try userid EOL67313 password WELCOME!
1312	I hope you have access to e-mail in KW.
1312	I'm down with the flu so we won't be able to make it.
1312	I was really looking forward to this for a number of reasons - including the chance to get together with you.
1312	I didn't have your phone number or e-mail address at home so I had a friend drop my work computer off on his way home tonight.
1312	I've left a message for Don at home - sorry about late notice.
1312	Mark
1313	shouldn't the people who need filing cabinets order them for themselves?
1314	You are set to move as soon as the current construction phase is completed - we hope that will be by March 1.
1315	In case you need to know....
1316	I may have missed it, but a VERY quick look at CNN's site showed no reports of computer virus activity since November.
1317	Not sure why you weren't on this distribution....
1318	Can you follow up with Anthony Dayao?
1319	I should be down for sick time for Mon.
1319	through Thurs.
1319	last week.
1320	Works for me.
1321	In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels downtown you might consider: The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I think) and the Driskill.
1321	Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have been updated.
1321	For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.
1321	The Stephen F. Austin was just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear they did a nice job.
1321	Both are primarily business hotels so they may have good weekend rates.
1322	Sounds good to me.
1323	Still available?
1324	FYI
1325	FYI
1326	I'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.
1326	It would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so we can book the correct size boat.
1326	You can always change the amount of groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.
1326	I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra room - it looks great from the website.
1326	Will you be golfing or should we make massage appointments?
1326	Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).
1326	My guess is it's an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty late.
1326	Tell Amanda I said Hi!
1327	Very funny - although I have to say I thought yours was the least humorous of the bunch.
1328	Fred - Here is a draft NDA - you will need to fill in the address for the customer.

1331	The EnronOnline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the GTC's when EnronOnline transactions are confirmed.
1331	They have suggested a sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the GTC's which can be accessed on the website.
1331	Any thoughts?
1332	As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the last several months.
1332	While so far we have been able to find places for everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file cabinet space on the floor.
1332	In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.
1332	Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.
1332	Once we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to allocate the available file cabinet space.
1332	Most if not all of us will have to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.
1333	Apparently my first attempt wasn't delivered to you guys.
1333	Sorry about that.
1334	Sheri - I'm not sure this is an issue for me.
1334	Aren't you in Lance's group now?
1334	Mark
1335	Here is another draft from the business guys.
1336	Janette - Can you give us the straight scoop?
1337	I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.
1337	She relates the following points: Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for the new building generally While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes) Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing this work for the legal department Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk about how you want to move forward.
1338	Tana - Do we have NDAs in place with the following companies that would cover discussions with them concerning wireless connectivity for EnronOnline?
1338	Agent Go Aether Systems JP Systems
1339	Do we have our other desired changes incorporated at this point?
1340	I hope you've had the VCR going.
1341	Any thoughts?
1342	Sounds good to me.
1343	Looks like I will NOT be able to have my cell phone on during our meetings - but here is the number if you need to get a message to me.
1344	Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she is working on in Mexico.
1344	Can you take care of this one?
1344	It looks like it is a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.
1344	Sara can probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that would be ok.
1345	FYI
1346	FYI
1347	When we meet this afternoon I'd also like to discuss the Canadian traders using EnronOnline average prices as an index for financial trades.
1348	Apparently this came yesterday but I didn't see it since it didn't come directly from David.
1348	Sorry about that.
1349	Yes, I'm planning to be on the call.
1350	This looks like a pretty good list.
1350	My suggestions would be to substitute Elizabeth Sager for Leslie Hansen who is on maternity leave and to add Denis O'Connell in London for credit derivatives.
1351	Please arrange for the promotion for Sara Shackleton from Sr. Counsel to Asst.
1351	General Counsel effective March 1, 2001.
1352	This was the last e-mail from Leslie on the topic.
1352	We talked afterwards and I thought she was going to talk to Andy about this but never heard back.
1353	Thanks for your note.
1353	Enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the trading that may be done by employees - even when they are not involved in a trading function.
1353	No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.
1353	The only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron.
1353	This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.
1353	I believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.
1353	I am sending her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further information, please contact her.
1353	Mark
1354	Gentlemen: Several points regarding the below: We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).
1354	Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
1354	If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for a master agreement.
1354	Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started.
1354	The e-mail from Dow indicates: "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the confirmations sent by Enron."
1354	All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them should stop immediately on legal grounds.
1354	The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.
1354	Does someone here have it?
1354	Let's hope it works out better this time.
1354	Mark
1355	All four look fine to me.
1355	To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Robert Bruce/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: "Chinese Wall" Classroom Training This is the first of four e-mails I am forwarding for your review.
1355	Mark Haedicke said you should review them before they go out.
1355	Janette Elbertson Enron North America Corp. Legal Department - EB3326
1356	FYI
1357	I think the "Wes" we were looking for the other day may be Wes Colwell who I think may be in charge of accounting for ENA.
1357	If not, maybe somebody on this list will know something about FAS133.
1358	Sounds good to me.
1359	Looks good to me.
1359	Please make sure Holly puts it on the group calendar.
1360	Yes, a standard presentation that shows generally what traders see when they use the system would be good.
1360	We should definitely avoid being too technical.
1361	They don't have the exclusive line (brand new) boat for our week but they do have this one.
1361	If you can get in the night before we can actually stay on the boat and leave early in the morning - effectively getting an extra day of sailing.
1361	If you want to check it out online, their website is www.moorings.com and the boat is a 463.
1361	There's some good stuff on the site for people who've never been before - Bill might find it comforting.
1362	I have taken a stab at a Legal & Privacy Statement for the Broker version of EnronOnline.
1362	Please take a look and let me know what you think.
1362	Justin - I don't know if or when they expect to launch something like this in Europe but I expect it won't be long.
1362	Mark G. has been working on the Broker version of the ETA (the "BETA") and a Fee Agreement which we can send along.
1363	Subj.
1363	test
1364	Many changes.
1365	Here's my stab.
1366	Approved.
1367	Becky - please take Mark Haedicke off of the distribution list for this meeting.
1368	Stephanie: This is like a very complicated game of musical chairs.
1368	Right now there arpeople in the offices that have been designated for Michelle and Gail.
1368	Wecan't move you guys in until we move them out.
1368	We can't move them out yetbecause we don't have any more places to move people!
1368	There is a design that has been drawn up to create some additional space (essentially by shrinking a lot of other spaces) which I hope will be built out by mid March.
1368	That's the best I can do right now.
1368	Sorry for the confusion.
1368	Mark To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Moving Date to 38 Janette Elbertson advised that you are the planning person for the space over on 38.; Gail Brownfeld, Michelle Blaine and myself will be moving over tand some point in the near future.; Would you be able to tell me if a definite date (or ballpark date) has been scheduled?; Thank you for your|
1369	Approved
1370	I'm in all week - just give me a call.
1371	Approved.
1371	Do we have extra monitors/keyboards already on the floor?
1372	Any idea how I should handle this?
1373	Just wanted to make sure you had received this.
1374	Just wanted to say hello.
1374	I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how things were going.
1374	Have you moved out of the hotel yet?
1374	I know how depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.
1374	Even though the hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very nice, it was still just a hotel room.
1374	I was so glad to get out of there into an apartment - major quality of life improvement.
1374	We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.
1374	Ted wants to leave town to do something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.
1374	Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft.
1374	Lauderdale is even too high for Ted.
1374	Ted's brother is working on a project here in town so we had him over the other night for dinner.
1374	Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.
1374	How do you just forget something like that?
1374	Luckily they went to the gym ahead of time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and bought his brother a steak on the way home.
1374	That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty much the whole thing has been given back.
1374	I'm still going to buy a new car - looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.
1374	Hope you are doing well!
1374	Mark
1375	The cruise is a western Caribbean cruise on a Carnival Lines ship - leaving from Galveston on the 17th.
1375	I'm actually looking forward to it.
1375	I may not be partying with the best of them (or have a body that would entitle me to even try) but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now.
1375	As for Europe, Ted is thinking London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Finland, Iceland and Norway (think blond and English speaking).
1375	Personally, I'm reasonably flexible, but I'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in France or relaxing in a Tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.
1375	Berlin, Prague and Budapest appeal since I've never been to any of them.
1375	Or maybe I can get over to Barcelona just before your cruise with Ted - maybe with a few days in the wine country or Madrid beforehand?
1376	FYI
1377	Every time I try to go to the "next step" and choose a hotel room type I get the hotel selection for the Sonoma weekend instead of whichever trip I'm looking at.
1378	Let's talk at our group meeting tomorrow about the changes we should be making to our forms based on the CFMA and our conversation with Ken Raisler.
1379	Wow - I suppose it might be mine but I have no idea what it is!
1380	My comments below.
1381	As soon as you like.
1382	My guess is this was a holdover from last year's list.
1383	Ann Ballard in the Corp. legal dept.
1383	called me about these guys today.
1383	You might check with her to see where things stand.
1384	This is one I did for steel.
1384	It should probably be beefed up to include reference to an ISDA master to be signed up front.
1385	Here's one Carol did.
1386	FYI
1387	FYI.
1388	OK
1389	I think this is probably OK.
1389	You should probably just check with Samantha & Tana to make sure they aren't planning something then.
1389	Since it is Good Friday, it might be a little slower than usual.
1390	Greg: It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.
1390	There is nowhere else on the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and calls.
1390	So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.
1390	On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already covers the treatment of holidays: ...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the preceding business day)...
1390	which makes the deleted language redundant.
1391	If they can figure out a way to do it, more power to them - but there are only just so many characters available in the short description line.
1392	I wish I could - unfortunately I will be out of town on vacation next week.
1392	Thanks for asking!
1393	I'm not sure if Carol's request ever made it to you - she is asking for a flat panel monitor - approved.
1394	Thanks for your note - here is the form.
1394	I think we should be able to find someone internally so let's at least try that first.
1395	Mary - here are the confirms I mentioned.
1395	Mike - can you send us a red-lined version from the original Annex A form?
1396	Let's look at the internal candidates first.
1397	It's OK to open AIG Energy Trading Inc. for US financial gas & power.
1398	I'll be out the 26th but in the 27th - the afternoon would probably be better for me since it will be my first day back after vacation.
1399	OK
1400	Thought you might be interested in this message that went out to all Enronemployees.
1401	That works for me - Brent & I are both on 38 - my office is 3892.
1402	Sorry for the delay - the general rule is that we will pay for a reasonable usage plan (huge numbers of minutes don't count as reasonable) but the phone itself is your own.
1403	I guess it looks OK to me.
1403	I'm surprised that they will have the ability to identify their own company as a counterparty.
1403	Don't we limit the companies they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?
1404	FYI
1405	Marcus - I understand you are the new physical power online lawyer - lucky you!
1405	Here's one that the EOL people are anxious to get covered.
1405	I'd be happy to sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to talk to Tana a bit as well.
1405	Mark
1406	Shari Stack has resigned but Marcus Nettelton has been appointed to take over from the physical power side.
1406	I'll sit down with him today and get him up to speed.
1407	I think the "sm" is their attempt to designate "enymex" as a service mark.
1407	To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: (01-91) Exchange Selects GlobalView Software Inc. c forCustomer Interface Infrastructure what exactly is an "enymexsm"...
1408	Jim will fill in when Tom isn't here - I'll figure out a way to get him the key, etc.
1409	The next step is for Chad to contact the Credit Group in RAC.
1409	They will do the credit analysis and send a credit worksheet to the Swap Group paralegals who will prepare the first draft, run it by a lawyer and get it ready for the customer.
1410	I tend to agree with you, but Nora Dobin is the lawyer who knows the most about the DealBench system - you should probably check with her.
1411	I suggest you work through Matthew Dawson in the London legal department.
1411	They should be able to help you.
1412	I will be on vacation from Monday the 19th through Monday the 26th (returning to the office on Tuesday the 27th).
1412	My cell phone and pager will not work either at sea or in the countries I will be visiting.
1412	I can be reached via Maritime Communications Network at (877)225-7447 - you will need to give my name and the name of the ship - Celebration.
1412	Since the rates are around $10 per minute, I don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will call in when in port.
1413	I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related to EnronOnline.
1413	To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the system.
1413	If that doesn't work I would try Savita Puthigai (x31787) or David Forster (x31861) on the EnronOnline team.
1414	David - I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but thought I ought to send it on to you.
1414	I will be out of the office (vacation) until the 27th and didn't want to lose the entire week.
1414	Mark ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one from you regarding a possible conflict - my understanding is that we're just assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that case I tend to think there's no problem.
1415	I have not yet done the performance reviews for several people in the group.
1415	They are due by the 28th.
1415	Please schedule 45 min.
1415	for me with each of Sara, Mary, Brent, Carol and Bob Bruce on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning.
1416	I'll certainly take them if nobody else does.
1417	I hadn't heard from you in a while - just wondered how you were.
1418	Any chance you're attending again this year?
1418	It would be nice to catch up.
1419	I highlighted the items I am concerned about (hard copy in your tray) - please check and make sure they make sense for us to pay.
1420	Sounds like a great idea.
1420	a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?
1420	If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.
1421	Yes - Thanks!
1422	Thanks for the message back - I'll see you Friday!
1423	How does this process usually start?
1424	I think it's a nice idea.
1425	Chris - Looks OK to me.
1426	Sorry about that Vance - I just missed it.
1426	I don't see any problems here either.
1427	Erica - I have no legal objections to the presentation.
1427	I do have to wonder if it is wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of the success of EnronOnline to the company's business on the platform itself.
1427	Mark
1428	Here's a draft of the bullet points you requested:
1429	Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.
1429	The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.
1429	Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.
1429	If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.
1429	That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
1429	My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.
1429	In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.
1429	I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.
1429	Mark
1430	Harry - are you the right lawyer to look at this?
1431	Thanks Bill - appreciate your help!
1432	Doc - I'll be in town through Sunday morning.
1432	Any chance we can get together for dinner Saturday eve.?
1432	Mark
1433	Thanks Doc - sounds like fun - see you Saturday!
1434	Paul - Sorry for the delay.
1434	I see no problems with this in the current format.
1434	There might be an issue if the description of the product included the word COMEX or any other trademark of the exchange.
1434	I'm not too concerned about the presence of "COMEX" in the long description since presumably that will not appear on Reuters.
1434	Mark T.
1435	That's probably OK - just a little further into the gray.
1435	The main concern is that we not be "marketing" the product with reference to the exchange - in our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX lookalike" or something similar.
1436	Bill - Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just got your message this morning.
1436	Don't worry about sailing skills.
1436	Among the rest of us we have that pretty well covered.
1436	We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any serious damage.
1436	We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in the world to sail around for a few days.
1436	Navigation is easy (you can always see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to handle).
1436	The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in fact the critical skills for a trip like this.
1436	We sure don't want anyone on board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!
1436	If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com.
1436	Under "Destinations" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.
1436	Under "Charter Fleet" we'll be on a Moorings 463.
1436	Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.
1436	I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the airport.
1436	About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food and drinks.
1436	Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will take care of most of that.
1436	Any particular beverage requests?
1436	Beer, wine, liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?
1436	And finally, just a bit if extra info: 1.
1436	Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.
1436	We will have a local cell phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.
1436	If you need to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in Tortola (284)494-2332.
1436	They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if a call comes in. 2.
1436	A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you think you'll need.
1436	US Dollars are the currency.
1436	3.
1436	You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.
1436	4.
1436	Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow on the boat) and try to carry everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.
1436	That's about all I can think of right now.
1436	Feel free to ask any other questions.
1436	I'm starting to get excited now too.
1436	It's hard to believe it's less than 3 weeks away!
1436	Mark
1437	Please arrange.
1438	I don't think I knew we were making a mid-week drop at the airport.
1438	We need to remember that as we plan where we'll be.
1439	No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs trades in the relevant commodities.
1439	In fact, we used that language to mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms when they first signed up for EnronOnline.
1439	To the extent we want to eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their agreement.
1439	From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for GTC-governed transactions without asking the customer first.
1439	Whether or not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will leave to others.
1439	Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available......
1440	Bill, Thanks for the info.
1440	Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs who will get you into a van or bus to the base.
1440	It's a little harder to get to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).
1440	It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.
1440	Mind sending yours along?
1440	Mark
1441	Yes, silly me.
1441	But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day of his flight.
1441	It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.
1441	I assume you're still at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.
1442	I'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for US deals.
1442	If you guys want to, I have no objection.
1442	We came up with some language to insert into the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the GTC and incorporating it by reference.
1442	Bob Bowen has the final version of the language (I think it varied slightly between various commodities).
1442	Just as a 'heads up' we are also starting down the road of doing away with confirmations altogether for certain US EnronOnline transactions.
1442	Maybe we should chat about that and I can give you all the details.
1442	It's going to be a lengthy and painful process.
1443	Some interesting articles in this one.
1444	Thanks for the credit card number - I'm sure it will come in handy some day.
1444	I was actually planning to pay for the Moorings portion of this as a graduation present.
1444	Is that OK?
1445	I need your birthday and address to finalize the info for the Moorings.
1445	Finals going OK?
1446	Ken - I have a question about the interpretation of this paragraph of the EnronOnline Legal & Privacy Statement.
1446	Maybe we can talk about it when we talk about the clearing issue.
1446	14.

1447	Thanks for the info.
1447	And I sure hear your -- especially re: crim pro!
1447	On the evidence front, I did the same thing you did -- took it for bar purposes -- but I never cease to be amazed at how often it comes up in my non-litigator's practice.
1447	So don't despair, it may yet be helpful.\ I'm really looking forward to sailing too.
1447	Just two weeks!
1447	Mark
1448	Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.
1448	Exempt commodities are all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities.
1449	I'm afraid I already have plans but thanks for the invite.
1450	We have reservations with Eric, the golf pro, on Friday afternoon at 3:00.
1450	He thinks 4 or 5 holes will takes us 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
1450	We don't have to play just holes 1 through 5 but can pick and choose -- based to some extent on where other people are playing.
1450	Saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 2:00 with a manicure/pedicure to follow at 3:00.
1450	My massage is at 2:00.
1450	Amanda decided not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party.
1450	She is going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at Boar's Head for 11:45.
1451	Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve.
1451	so no golf and I had assumed he would be with Amanda on Saturday.
1451	We may miss out on tea.
1451	Any idea what the hours are?
1451	We won't be done with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.
1451	You won't be finished with your nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq and Amanda's do).
1451	I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.
1452	very clever
1453	The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.' Since we needed something for Fri.
1453	afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the golf I went ahead and made the reservation that way.
1453	The manicure was Amanda's idea.
1453	Never having had one, I just assumed they dried them for you.
1453	Would you rather have a facial?
1453	I didn't ask about the morning.
1454	Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.
1454	I haven't gotten a virus yet but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!
1454	My fairly new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys.
1454	They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one.
1454	Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.
1454	I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.
1454	The last few days (18 - 21) I'll be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.
1454	I may be able to send that number before I leave.
1454	Love, Mark
1455	I thoroughly agree about tea -- if you can reschedule your manicure the timing would be perfect.
1455	And you're right about Sunday afternoon too -- I'm sure by then we'll be ready for a rest.
1455	Do we have plans for Sunday eve.?
1455	Do we care?
1456	I think we're committed to Keswick - haven't we paid for Sun.
1456	night there already?
1457	Bill: I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.
1457	It's not required reading but I thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing.
1457	Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are surprisingly useful).
1457	There's a lot of information in there.
1457	If you want to focus on just a few, the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to visit are: Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to be there The Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, good snorkeling nearby Jost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace & Love in Little Harbor and Foxy's in Great Harbor Sandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch or quick swim stop Cane Garden Bay - a little tricky getting in but well worth it - the quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, etc.) Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called The Last Resort Cooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option The Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop here Bitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to go There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and then back into the BVI when we go back over there.
1457	Kind of a lot of trouble, particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in. We've done it before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.
1457	Of course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.
1457	So stay tuned.
1457	We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.
1457	One alternative is to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min.
1457	walk to the airport.
1457	Or we can drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!
1457	I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.
1457	They aren't that important unless you check bags.
1457	Please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day.
1457	I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.
1457	Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing: Call or e-mail with any questions.
1457	Mark (713)853-7459 (work)
1458	Unfortunately I already have plans.
1458	But thanks for the invite!
1459	Since we will all be swamped trying to get out of here on time tomorrow, I think we should defer the group meeting.
1459	I will be out of town on the 16th, so please check your calendars to see if 10:00 on the 9th will work as a substitute.
1460	I'll be there!
1461	An extra $200 is just a drop in this bucket.
1461	St. Regis sounds good to me.
1462	You always make me laugh.
1462	Why don't you just pay for you.
1462	You've been footing the bill for Amanda & her friends all these years; it's your turn to take a break!
1462	By the way, I don't remember pointing out that she is spoiled - thinking it often enough, but not pointing it out.
1462	Of course we both know how my tongue loosens and my memory locks up in direct proportion to the volume of alcohol consumed.....
1463	The recent amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act essentially codified the prior regulations on this point.
1463	If this technique was effective in 1998 it should still be effective today.
1464	Taffy did a great job setting all of this up so the visiting attorneys had places to work and use the phone and their computers.
1464	I don't know that it is part of her job description -- she just saw the need and filled it.
1465	I got this from Stewart today......
1466	FYI
1467	You may already have this but I thought I'd send it along.
1468	From marshallconsultants.com SENIOR MEDIA RELATIONS PROFESSIONALS with the savvy to deal with varied andsensitive issues needed for the leading organization in one of North Americs top spectator sports.?
1468	Work will require heavy travel to sporting eventsacross the country ) in some cases as many as 30 weekends per year away from home base.?

1468	Email Justin Meyer
1469	As you already know, it's that time again.
1469	Since I am leaving on vacation Friday morning, please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no later than noon tomorrow (Thursday) so that I can approve them and get the process started before I leave.
1469	Sorry for the inconvenience.
1469	Mark
1470	Can you please see if you can get me out of this?
1470	I have to talk to Ken Raisler with Brent & Julia at 2 and with tomorrow being my last day before vacation it will no doubt be too hectic to do an interview.
1471	She's right - there are a couple of high class resorts that require long pants and a collared shirt but we can easily avoid those.
1471	The first few years we went sailing down there I always took long pants and even a sport coat "just in case."
1471	The sport coat NEVER got used.
1471	I usually wear a pair of khakis on the plane since they are sometimes cold and have used them a couple of times down there over the years but for the most part it's a tres casual part of the world.
1472	p.s.
1472	Did you get the cruising guide I sent?
1473	Approved.
1474	Glad you got the package.
1474	I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter Principle is in operation in my life.
1474	I know how all the pieces move but I can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out professionally.
1474	So if you want someone to use to provide nearly unlimited examples of how to make mistakes in playing (while nevertheless following the rules), I'm your man.
1475	Oops - I didn't notice that your first message this morning went to Linda & Amanda also.
1475	I guess we'd better bring a pair of long pants.
1476	Here is a first draft of an amendment agreement.
1476	Please feel free to rip it to shreds.
1477	Peter: My only concerns would be: (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same entity for netting and setoff purposes.
1477	(2) It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in Canada.
1477	We are pretty restricted in that area in the US.
1477	As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada.
1477	(3) If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA.
1477	Let me know if I can be of any help.
1477	Mark T.
1478	I don't have copies of any of the FASB pronouncements.
1478	I suggest you find one of the accountants who handles these things.
1478	I don't know who that is so i would start wit Paige Grumulaitis -- she seems to know most accounting answers and when she doesn't, she knows who to ask.
1479	Ken Raisler will be here on Monday, May 21 to conduct several training sessions for the weather and steel trading desks.
1479	If you can work it into your schedule, please try and attend one or more of these sessions.
1479	Brent will have further scheduling details.
1479	Mark
1480	Sorry I haven't been able to respond.
1480	I have been swamped trying to get away for a vacation and in fact am leaving in the morning.
1480	I will have to get back to you when I return which will not be until the 22nd.
1481	I was just cleaning out my e-mails (well, a few of them anyway) and ran across this.
1481	I hope you already knew about it but if not maybe it's not too late to have input.
1482	I got another one.
1483	Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.
1483	I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.
1483	Is it yours?
1484	And another.....
1485	Approved.
1486	I got another one.
1487	And another.....
1488	Please check your records and make sure your e-mails intended for me are addressed to the correct Mark Taylor.
1488	There are two of us here at Enron and the other Mark is getting some of your EOL approvals e-mails.
1489	Here is the first draft from the EnronOnline folks.
1490	Stacey, Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions: 1.
1490	Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one. If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.) 2.
1490	German Energy Markets 3.
1490	Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate: Christophe's panel discussion on new markets E-commerce panel I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.
1491	Yes, I think I did approve this by a reply e-mail earlier this week.
1492	approved
1493	Is this one OK as well?
1494	The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the making of reservations for reward travel.
1495	approved
1496	Tony - Here is the resume of the candidate we discussed last week.
1496	Mark
1497	As per my call.
1498	Here is a draft of the US version.
1498	Please let me know if it works for you.
1499	As per my call.
1500	I've got three undeveloped rolls of film in my car that I keep meaning to get developed but always forget until I'm not in the car.
1500	I'll get around to it one of these days.
1500	My address is: 1322 Rutland St.
1501	Homer - The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month.
1501	As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month.
1501	Is that a real issue for us here?
1501	We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month): Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction.
1501	In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).
1501	That is a commercial call.
1501	Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.
1501	If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.
1501	Mark
1502	Here are my pitiful attempts at photos from the trip:
1503	Here are my pitiful attempts at photos from the trip:
1504	There would have been more of these if I could just learn to keep my fingers out from in front of the lens......
1505	Can you help them with this?
1506	Can you help them with this?
1507	I haven't heard anything from anyone but you and the EnronOnline team.
1507	I suggest we go forward as you suggested in your June 4 e-mail and deal with the mid-month to mid-month issue if it ever actually arises.
1508	Let's discuss this.
1509	As per our call.
1510	Let's discuss this.
1511	Can you coordinate with Holly?
1512	Veronica - The a/c people didn't make it Saturday because off the flooding.
1512	They called yesterday to reschedule and will be there this coming Saturday morning sometime after 8:00.
1512	Let me know if you won't be around so I can let them in. Mark "Veronica Brock" 06/11/2001 08:24 AM To: mark.taylor@enron.com cc: Subject: A/C Arrangements Mark, Do you have a number where I can call the technician in regards to checking the a/c system?
1512	I don't know whether I need to make arrangements or if you will.
1512	Please advise.

1513	Thanks for your note.
1513	You're lucky with the computer -- I also have road runner service but mine has been out for several days.
1513	Good luck with your clean-up!
1514	Thanks for your note.
1514	Do you have a lot of people missing in action this morning?
1514	In addition to Brent (no surprise there) I'm missing Susan (again, no real surprise - they weren't even flooded but the roof leaked) and Sara (who was out of town and couldn't get a flight back until this morning.

1515	(article re: Broadband)
1516	February/March 2001 Issue Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time.
1516	It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products.
1516	Crucially, both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.
1516	In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network.
1516	Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at Enron.
1516	"When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.
1516	The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development.
1516	Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases.
1516	"There is a premium in the price for firm delivery," says Thuraisingham.
1516	He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker.
1516	In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market.
1516	"most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.
1517	Broadband Networking News Mark Holmes 03/27/2001 Enron Hits Back Quickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications conglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electronics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand (EOD) service.
1517	Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electronics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental to Enron 's broadband customers.
1517	The deal is a positive development for Enron after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service.
1517	"The exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service," explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of Enron Broadband Services.
1517	"The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing, but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete," notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warburg.
1517	"I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving traffic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company, which is what they did."
1517	The failure of the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery business.
1517	"I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron ," Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tells Broadband Networking News.
1517	"I think they will probably [get] one or two anchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."
1517	The deal with Electronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network.
1517	Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand.
1517	This is Enron 's core telecom business.
1517	The content deals, while important, are not being factored into most analysts' forecasts on the company.
1517	"I am confident that the content delivery business will be successful," says Ray Niles, a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
1517	"The fact of the matter is they did get another deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not very successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage."
1517	"The reality is that no one had any earnings (from Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yannello adds.
1517	"It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It is disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."
1517	Enron, which produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbuster deal.
1517	"We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannello says.
1517	"That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $25 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Blockbuster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $25 telecom valuation."
1518	He told me, but I think it's still supposed to be under wraps.

1520	Thanks for your note.
1520	I came through pretty much OK but my garage was flooded and my house turned into a little island there for a few hours.
1521	I think I am probably the right person.
1521	Glad to help.
1522	This looks good to me.
1523	You probably already have this but just in case.....
1524	Approved
1525	Approved

1527	You will need to grant permissions to all group members both in the "Outlook Today" box at the top of your folders list and in the "Calendar" box.
1527	1.
1527	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and then "Folder List") 2.
1527	Left click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up 3.
1527	Left click on the "Permissions" tab 4.
1527	Add all of the swap group members as "Reviewers" to give them read access Repeat the above process but starting on the "Calendar" line of your folders list.
1527	Once everyone has done this, we will all be able to access each other's calendars by using the File Open menu.
1528	Chris - any chance you can show what the specific changes are?
1529	I got your message and the e-mail.
1529	I'll be happy to go pick them up.
1529	Once I have them I'll let you know and we can arrange for you to get them.
1530	FYI
1531	It really was unbelievable.
1531	Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast. The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house. It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in. Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble. Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside. The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped. I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no standing water anywhere. By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone. Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges! I didn't see it myself but I hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. You missed a big one!
1532	(i) It constitutes an "eligible contract participant" as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended 7 U.S.C.
1532	?1a(12) and (ii) it constitutes an "eligible commercial entity" as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended 7 U.S.C.
1532	?1a(11).
1533	1 - NOT a bulkhead 2 - Prefer an aisle 3 - if it is a 2 - 2 - 2 configuration, prefer one of the center two seats
1534	Just wanted to let you know that I plan on attending the June 25 meeting along with Jonathan Marsh and perhaps one or two others from Enron.
1535	I have your travelers Checks.
1535	Are you mobile yet?
1536	I have to agree.
1536	It sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation.
1536	If we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here, we should be willing to pay SOME kind of premium, even if it is fairly small.
1537	I'm happy to take a look at the proposed language and coordinate with the lawyers in London and Singapore.
1537	The difficulty in making the Long Description language the same around the world is that the underlying GTC's are necessarily different because they are governed by different laws.
1537	We'll see what we can do.
1538	Hope you had a good vacation.
1538	Thanks for forwarding all of my mail.
1538	Now that I've been migrated to Outlook it may actually get worse instead of better.
1538	My assistant is trying to see if there isn't something the IT people can do.
1539	FYI
1540	I have inserted my changes below.
1541	I have left a lengthy voicemail for you with my comments -- the comments aren't that lengthy, just the voicemail.
1541	Please call if you have any questions: or page me at 1-877-855-2081
1542	Louise Kitchen has asked to be included and receive copies of our answers.
1543	I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."
1543	My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.
1543	That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.
1543	I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.
1543	The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.
1543	Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.
1543	That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."
1543	Do I have this all wrong?
1544	I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there.
1544	I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon.
1544	I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them.
1544	Don't worry if that's not possible.
1544	I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock.
1544	Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.?
1545	If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone # 44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.
1545	And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.
1545	But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers.
1546	Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.
1546	If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.
1546	We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
1546	We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.
1546	Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.
1546	Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).
1546	The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.
1546	This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.
1546	The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.
1546	Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.
1546	If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.
1546	Hope this is helpful.
1546	Let me know if it makes sense to you.
1546	Mark P.S.
1546	-- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.
1546	There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.
1546	The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.
1546	My name usually has my phone number next to it.
1546	We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.
1547	We agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the EOL people to make sure that it works on the system.
1547	I haven't heard back.
1548	Dale - I know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals.
1548	We have asked Stephanie Panus, one of the other paralegals in the group, to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along.
1548	Tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and I am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week.
1548	Mark
1549	Yes, I was working with Justin Boyd and Ian Brungs in the legal dept.
1549	I think they sent the revisions to Arfan.
1550	Since we are not an FCM or an IB, I think we can let this one go.
1551	looks fine to me
1552	Rats - I thought I had picked a day when we were all going to be here - your day off was not listed on my group calendar.
1552	Sorry!
1553	Thanks Chris.
1553	I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.
1553	Bottom line, I don't think we will be advocating the MFA position.
1554	Kelly: Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.
1554	Here's what I've done: Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.
1554	But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.
1554	The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.
1554	I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.
1554	I have no feel for the timing on the Proj.
1554	Mgr.
1554	position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch.
1554	Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.
1554	I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.
1554	On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.
1554	Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!
1554	I'll keep you posted on the others.
1554	If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.
1554	At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.
1554	Mark
1555	I will not be able to attend.
1556	We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.
1556	It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.
1556	No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.
1556	Janet Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.
1556	The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions.
1557	We should talk about this when you have a minute.
1558	This is fine with me.
1558	In the past, Dave wanted to see all of the ETA and PA amendments that we negotiated with EnronOnline users.
1558	I take it these should go to you now.
1558	If it comes to you from me, Leslie Hansen or Mark Greenberg, you can assume that Legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval.
1558	Let us know if you no longer want to receive these.
1559	Could one of you please take a look at the red-lined language in the attachment and let me know if it is ok to approve it.
1559	Thanks!
1560	I'm coming to New York this weekend and will be there until Tuesday.
1560	Any chance we could get together for a drink while I'm in town?
1560	Mark
1561	FYI
1562	Thanks -- I agree.
1563	I have the pager with me but don't know if it's working.
1563	Would you mind sending a test message?
1563	Did you set up a lunch for me for tomorrow with David Mitchell?
1563	It isn't on my calendar - or at least not the calendar I can access from the road.
1563	Hope you had a good weekend!
1563	Mark
1564	Everyone I've talked to was thoroughly impressed.
1564	I'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from Cheryl on Friday indicating she wanted to talk about it...not sure yet what that means.
1564	I'm out of town today and tomorrow - if you have time to stop by Cheryl's office & ask, that might help.
1564	My only concern with Kim at all is that she probably can't start until September.
1564	Probably worth the wait though.
1565	This is a test e-mail page.
1566	I will be happy to attend.
1567	I'm afraid I will have to be on the phone for this one.
1568	David - Apologies for my silence.
1568	I need to check with Mark H. and make sure he is still on board but I think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and schedule something for early September.
1568	Mark
1569	FYI
1570	No problem.
1571	This looks ok to me but I thought I should run it by you first.
1571	Any objections?
1572	As per my voice mail.
1573	FYI - I will stick my head in today.
1574	I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.
1574	You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).
1574	I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).
1574	My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.
1574	With that in mind I have also booked jr.
1574	suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.
1574	They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).
1574	Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.
1574	The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.
1574	Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.
1574	That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.
1574	On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!
1574	They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.
1574	What's your preference?
1575	looks good to me - do I need to approve this in the system?
1576	Let's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can - that may not be until September but if she can make it sooner that would be great.
1577	Here is the first of the no more confirms agreements.
1577	Can you please handle this one?
1577	Even though it came to me over two weeks ago I didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and EOL people called asking for it (entirely my fault) so there is a certain urgency to it.
1577	I also have counterparties for Francisco, Sara and Frank to get started on, but I thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues.
1578	Here is the Aquilla no-more-confirms agreement.
1579	Have we been officially sanctioned by the LME?
1579	If so, please send me a copy of any official statements of sanction.
1579	Depending on exactly what they say, we may have to report the situation to other exchanges here and possibly the CFTC.
1579	Thanks!
1580	Here is the no-more-confirms document I mentioned.
1581	here it is
1582	Here is the first of the no-more-confirms agreements.
1582	Power and Gas have already made their changes to the form so now it's our turn.
1582	Sara, Mary and Francisco also have counterparties they are working on.
1583	Here is the first of the no-more-confirms agreement.
1583	Power and Gas have already made their changes so now it's our turn.
1583	Sara, Brent and Mary also have counterparties they are working on.
1584	When: Monday, July 23, 2001 2:00 PM-3:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
1584	Where: EB2126
1585	FYI
1586	FYI
1587	Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.
1587	At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.
1587	I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.
1587	The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable.
1588	I asked for a return date for you of September 12 which is the day I'm coming back.
1588	But since I will be going to Houston and you will be going to NYC we won't be traveling together anyway.
1588	Would you rather stay an extra day or two?
1589	Will you guys be around the first weekend in August?
1589	I have to be in nyc the 1st & 2nd on business - thought I'd check and see what you were up to.
1589	Mark
1590	Here are my comments:
1591	Your reservations went through on the card you wanted.
1591	I asked for 9/12 as your return date and 9/26 as Amanda's.
1592	Veronica, The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.
1592	That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.
1592	That's ok with me if it works for you.
1592	Mark
1593	Let's plan on it.
1593	My only question is whether I'll be able to come on Friday eve.
1593	or have to wait until Sat.
1593	a.m. Do you have plans that would make one day better than the other?
1593	I have a 4:00 flight back to Houston on Sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the Newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me.
1594	Tom Gros and the Commodity Logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so.
1594	The demos are scheduled for 1:30 to 2:30 and 3:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon in EB5C2.
1594	Please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested.
1595	I already have a meeting scheduled at 11 on Monday.
1596	If this doesn't work, I can just send you the three whole presentations.
1596	Let me know.
1596	Mark
1597	Unfortunately, it's each one comes from a different presentation -- here are all three: Slide 3 Slide 9 Value Proposition Slide 31
1598	Here is the language for the risk control slide.
1598	Sorry I can't send it to you as a slide but what they sent me was actually 31 slides that Ken and I've distilled down to one.
1598	Enron Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) Market Risk Management Policy approved by Board of Directors Trading Limits Value at Risk daily reports -- stress testing Application of Extreme Value Theory Credit Risk Management Counterparty credit exposure aggregation and management Counterparty Value at Risk models Segregation of Duties; Independence of RAC optimizes focus on risk identification and performance measurement
1599	Here is the Doug Leach/Russell Dyk e-mail.
1600	Do I assume correctly that dinner is at home in NJ rather than at home in NY?
1601	What should we do about keeping track of names, phone numbers etc. for me?
1601	Is it time to start with one of the programs now available?
1602	ISDA's interview is on Wednesday afternoon.
1603	How did it go?
1604	Our agreements with EnronOnline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties (i.e. non-Enron companies).
1604	We can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products, but can not give the lists to anyone else.
1605	FYI
1606	We do know which companies use the system.
1606	I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.
1606	My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number.
1607	Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.
1607	Hope you made it back to town ok.
1607	I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.
1607	The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.
1607	Did the kids get away even close to on time?
1607	Thanks again!
1608	A spoon is a good start.
1608	I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?
1608	In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on.
1609	Sure - just send me the numbers -- or maybe a website or two.
1609	We run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time.
1610	Sorry for the delay.
1610	I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.
1610	Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00?
1611	Sorry for the delay -- these look fine to me.
1612	Can you add yourself to my rolodex?
1613	This came from the EOL info web site as it is.
1613	Maybe the PowerPoint experts can go there to get a better version?
1614	Do you know anything about this?
1615	Joel -- I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.
1615	I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you.
1616	I've checked with Alan and I think Mike R. is probably the right guy all the way around.
1617	I didn't see your name in any of these e-mails.
1617	Do you get involved in Trade Commission issues?
1618	Monday afternoon is much better for me.
1619	Is this something you are still handling?

1621	Here are the forms for the paralegals.
1621	I didn't have Marie on my list since she was with EBS reviewed her for the first half of the year.
1622	The project for converting our Lotus Notes database to Oracle is now underway.
1622	The technical people need a list of the upgrades we want as soon as possible.
1622	Tana will be stopping by within the next few days to solicit your input.
1622	Please give this some thought now so that you can be ready with suggestions for her.
1623	Thanks for a great weekend.
1623	Don's family was a lot of fun and what an incredible guest list for lunch!
1623	I wish I could have been better company.
1623	Love, Mark
1624	Please call me:
1625	Hi Justin -- I'm afraid I don't really know what this is all about.
1625	It sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing.
1625	Can you fill me in?
1626	I think it would be a good idea if you would print these out when you get them and bring them in at some point so we can go over them.
1627	Oops.
1627	Sorry, I'll bring them by.
1628	That's fine with me - I've booked it.
1628	Just let me know if you need to change the time.
1629	Janette -- would you please revise Mark's group list to delete Mark A Taylor and add me as Mark E Taylor?
1629	Thanks!
1630	Wow -- you must really get in early!
1630	Thanks for forwarding these things.
1630	I've asked Janette to revise her distribution list.
1630	Mark
1631	I think Holly talked the e-mail gods into making the change a month or so ago.
1631	The other Mark T. and I have gotten each other's e-mails for a long time but the switch to Outlook exacerbated the problem because we were totally indistinguishable in that system's address book.
1631	It's gotten a lot better since the revised names were put in.
1632	Yes, that makes sense to me.
1633	Good catch!
1633	I was thinking that Thanksgiving was the 29th -- oops.
1633	I'll get a revised quote.
1633	Any ideas for who wants to go?
1633	This particular boat has three cabins and heads.
1633	If we have another person (Jim?) or couple (the Johns?) we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive.
1633	And if there are even more, we could get a larger boat with four cabins.
1633	We just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved.
1634	Kay -- please revise your distribution list to remove Mark A Taylor and add me as Mark E Taylor.
1634	Thanks!
1635	Brad Richter and Jay Webb are now in charge at EnronOnline.
1635	Brad is responsible for the commercial side of things and Jay handles operations.
1636	Andy is still at Enron.
1636	He's working on the gas trading desk.
1637	Attached is a three page summary of our retail swaps interview in New York prepared by the CFTC.
1637	Please take a quick look at it and let me know if you have any comments.
1637	Mark
1638	I was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail.
1638	All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.
1638	There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.
1639	test message w/e
1640	using mataylo1
1641	Sorry for any confusion.
1641	You can use either mark.taylor or mark.e.taylor@enron.com for my e-mails.
1641	mtaylor@enron.com actually belongs to a colleague named Mitch Taylor so I don't know how it got to williard.com -- or where all those messages you've been sending ended up!
1641	All very confusing.
1642	yes
1643	I seem to remember that we talked about you doing Anne's review.
1643	I hope it's not just wishful thinking.
1643	Here is the form for her.
1644	I would like to attend.
1645	Here are the quotes from the Moorings.
1645	One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).
1645	The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.
1645	If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.
1645	I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc. Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?
1645	Other potential sailors to suggest?
1645	Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?
1646	If you have not sent me a current project list within the last week, please do so no later than noon tomorrow using the attached format.
1647	This is the current incarnation of project offline.
1647	They are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of EOL for them.
1647	I think Anne has been the point person for them.
1647	It is not related to the back office deal.
1648	Marie -- I'm afraid I don't have anything on physical bandwidth at all.
1648	It might make sense to check with the lawyers in EBS -- I would suggest you start with Cynthia Harkness and Robbi Rossi.
1649	1.
1649	EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.
1649	It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following: (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared; (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.
1649	3.
1649	EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.
1649	Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them.
1650	For future reference, please do not send schedules like this to the entire group.
1650	I'd rather these go out one by one.
1651	Nothing on my calendar yet.
1651	Andy Edison is setting it up and he knows to include you.
1652	II made my pledge some time ago so am concerned to hear my name is on the list.
1652	I'll try again.
1653	Bob -- Here is our first draft of the pop-up box language.
1653	Please circulate among the appropriate members of your group and let Barbara or me know if you have any comments.
1653	Language for the revised Password Application will follow.
1654	I haven't sent out the language draft yet because of another concern I thought of as you were leaving: the language as drafted doesn't allow us to give the names of these signers to potential third party posters.
1654	Any thoughts?
1655	remove
1656	Tana -- Please send the requested info to Jane.
1656	Thanks!
1656	Mark
1657	I have tickets to the Astros game on Friday (tomorrow) eve.
1657	Any interest?
1658	We're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.
1658	I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.
1658	I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time."
1659	Are you guys working on this already?
1660	I have found a couple of other people who are interested in going, but tonight is Ted's last night in town before moving to Ft.
1660	Lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game.
1660	Just let me know.
1661	Looks ok to me - please make sure it gets on the calendar.
1662	Looks good to me
1663	remove
1664	I'll be getting into Newark on Saturday the first on Continental flight 206 at 2:21 p.m.
1665	EnronOnline is pleased to announce that it will soon be making available to its users products posted by various non-Enron providers, initially natural gas transportation and storage products.
1665	If your company is interested in this new EnronOnline feature, please click the "yes" box below as your company's authorization for giving potential product providers your company's name as a prospective counterparty.
1665	Not at this time YES By authorized signatory
1666	Any entity, whether or not an Enron entity, that posts its products on the Website will be a third party beneficiary of this Password Application and the ETA to the same extent as if it were an affiliate of EnronOnline, LLC.
1666	Enron may give Counterparty's name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty.
1667	Do you have a copy in a format I can revise?
1668	Richard -- Has Credit done a review for AAA yet?
1668	We will need their input before we can evaluate the form.
1669	Holly - Please print these out for me.
1669	I need to mark them up and send back to Kal.
1670	Are we sending drafts by e-mail?
1670	I can imagine we probably are.
1670	If so, let's run a test by sending a real draft to one of us internally to open and see if there is a metadata problem.
1671	Create Limit Order Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit.
1671	If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.
1671	You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.
1671	*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission.
1671	Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.
1671	[m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression.
1671	[m2]This is the key!
1671	- we are changing our price, not showing their price.
1672	I'm going to be up near Kingston on Labor Day weekend.
1672	Just wondered if you were going to be open and if you rent sailboats by the hour, either bareboat or skippered.
1672	Mark Taylor
1673	I have checked and "Counterparty" is a defined term in the PA.
1674	Yes
1675	Here is the next one
1676	And another
1677	As we discussed.
1678	Here is one of the EOL - no-more-confirms amendments that the confirm desk is very anxious for us to get in place.
1678	Brent, Mary and Francisco have each don one or two already so they may have some insights into how to massage the form.
1678	The attached version has already been revised by the physical power and gas folks.
1679	Here is the next no-more-confirms amendment.
1679	I was hoping to wait until we had comments to the first set before working on these but the confirm desk is anxious that we move them forward.
1680	I seem to remember that you have had some experience dealing with the Texaco folks so maybe it makes sense for you to handle this one.
1681	FYI
1682	I feel sorry for the people coming across the Atlantic this week.
1682	One more reason to thank Amanda for switching our routing!
1683	Credit may require additional terms for specific counterparties.
1684	In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat: The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.
1684	The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.
1684	These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code."
1684	From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).
1684	From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).
1684	I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.
1684	It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.
1684	You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.
1684	Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.
1685	Please follow up on this for me - I shouldn't have to approve things for Martha since she's not in our group.
1686	I marked my comments on the document and left it in your office.
1687	Please give me a call about this - I'm not sure it makes sense to say that the index varies each day.
1688	Since this is for someone in the Governor's office, I have no objection.
1688	I think we need to be careful when regulators who might have an interest in regulating the system are asking.
1689	See you there.
1690	I'll be there.
1690	Large/0413/105657
1691	Frank Sayre will be working on this matter while Cheryl is on vacation.
1692	Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?
1692	There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.
1692	I assume we are only showing one side of this market.
1693	When: Friday, August 31, 2001 11:00 AM-12:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
1693	Where: EB3892
1694	Thanks Dave - this is it.
1695	This is a swap confirm.
1695	Do you have an option?
1696	I spoke with Joe Collins (see below) this morning.
1696	They are definitely thinking about the Commodity Exchange Act implications.
1696	They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.
1696	I gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction.
1697	Thanks for the note.
1697	I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.
1697	Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min.
1697	after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.
1697	Mark
1698	I will be out of the office until September 13.

1699	OK by me.
1700	Is there a call-in number for this meeting?
1700	(I'll be in NYC.)
1701	While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance: EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - Barbara Gray (x36832) Private e-marketplaces - Anne Koehler (x33488) Commodity Logic and hub issues - Mark Greenberg (x58897) Tana Jones (x33399) may also be able to answer some questions, particularly relating to EnronOnline counterparty approvals, and is pretty good at tracking down the appropriate lawyer if you can't.
1702	Requirements for Electronic Trading Facilities for Exempt Commodities Transactions must be principal to principal (no brokers) Parties must be Eligible Commercial Entities Same as Eligible Contract Participants ($10 mil. total assets or $1 mil. net worth) except: Must: have demonstrable ability to make or take delivery of the underlying commodity, or incur risks, in addition to price risk, related to the commodity, or be a dealer May not be a(n): investment company commodity pool employee benefit plan individual The facility must: Register with the CFTC giving: Name, address, person to receive notices Commodity categories to be traded Certifications that: Executives meet certain qualifications The facility will comply with exemption conditions The facility will notify the CFTC of any changes in information provided Identity of any clearing organizations to be used Give the CFTC access to trading protocols and electronic access to the system Provide reports to the CFTC regarding executed transactions as requested by the CFTC Maintain records of all transactions and participants for 5 years and give the CFTC access to the records Publicly disseminate price, trading volume and other trading data as required by the CFTC On special request, deliver to the CFTC such other information as it may request Transactions on such facilities are subject to the anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation jurisdiction of the CFTC
1703	Here is the list of the counterparties they want to put these agreements in place with and the lawyers that have been assigned to them.
1703	As you can see there are a number that have yet to be assigned.
1703	Would you please pass these out equitably among yourself, Frank, Mary and Francisco -- particularly those in town next week who will have a chance to move them forward.
1703	Kim Theriot is very anxious that we make headway on these.
1703	The counterparties marked with an asterisk are the most urgent.
1703	I will forward the docs I have received from Stacy and Janet as separate e-mails.
1703	Thanks!
1703	Mark
1704	Better check with Stacy to make sure they are done with this one.
1705	Barbara and I will both be out of the office next Thursday.
1705	Can you attend the Net Works staff meeting for me and fill me in on what happens?
1705	Thanks!
1705	Mark
1706	I'll let you guys decide who takes first crack at this one.
1707	Here's another which Janet hasn't seen yet.
1708	I was looking through my e-mails for these and couldn't find them.
1708	Have you guys already started these?
1708	I may have misplaced them.
1708	Please coordinate with Sara since I will be out next week.
1708	Thanks!
1708	Mark
1709	Please print these out for me and put them in the Commodity Logic file.
1710	I hope this isn't too late.
1710	If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.
1710	I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.
1710	I'm thinking of something to the effect of: Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.
1710	For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.
1710	Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.
1710	That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.
1710	The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as: 'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.
1710	The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.' If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.
1711	Yes.
1711	Louise was concerned that Dynegy was already doing this to manipulate a Canadian index to which we contribute daily volumes/prices.
1712	It would probably be a good idea to involve the power traders in this as well since it is not just an EnronOnline issue.
1713	Thanks - I have it.
1713	Do you remember how I'm supposed to check for messages on it?
1714	I'm in London today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in Houston on Thursday.
1714	Since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.
1714	But if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.
1715	Well deserved!
1715	It's been fun watching the company recognize what we in legal have known all along.
1715	(713)853-7459 phone (713)646-3490 fax
1716	Please see the attached memo from Sullivan & Cromwell.
1717	Thought you might find this interesting.
1718	Just to let you know I'm in London at the office here - staying at a hotel called 47 Park \St.
1718	and OK.
1718	If you need to reach me, dial 011 and then:
1719	Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office in London.
1719	Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.
1719	I received your fax and it looks fine.
1719	I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3 because of the cross reference to section 10.3.
1719	Please check the cross reference to section 10.3.
1719	Thanks.
1719	Linda p.s.
1719	-- if you can get through you can reach me at: Hope everyone is ok - we are watching on CNN.
1720	I got your note and relayed it to Linda.
1720	Our prayers are with you.
1721	I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.
1721	I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.
1721	Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.
1721	I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).
1721	I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.
1721	I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.
1721	The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.
1721	With any luck there won't be many.
1721	We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.
1721	I'll be in touch.
1722	Holly said you had been trying to reach me.
1722	I've tried to call several times but still haven't been able to get through to you on the phone.
1722	I tired to send this yesterday but it may not have gotten through.
1723	I'm in London.
1723	I had a 2 week vacation planned with Bill in Greece but he is unable to join me so I think we'll do that another time.
1723	Are you in London?
1723	Germany?
1723	If so do you want company?
1723	Call me at 020 7491 7282, suite 18 or 020 7881 500 471 or reply to this e-mail and Mark will get a message to me.
1724	Thanks for your note.
1724	I am stranded in London and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and I can get a seat.
1724	Looks like that means Sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me, too on Friday night.
1725	Thanks for that, Tim.
1725	I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the Marshall Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.
1726	I'm fine.
1726	I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.
1726	Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.
1726	Linda and Amanda are here, too.
1726	I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.
1726	Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.
1726	They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.
1726	I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.
1726	The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.
1726	I hope the flights are running by then.
1726	Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.
1726	Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.
1726	If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.
1726	It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.
1726	Hope you are doing ok through all this.
1726	I'm just sort of numb.
1726	Mark
1727	It looks like I'll be able to get back on Sunday.
1727	I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) but of course all the flights were cancelled yesterday and today.
1727	With luck they'll be back up to full schedules by Sunday when I have a reservation.
1727	I'll let you know if that changes.
1727	It's interesting to hear what your reactions were since they very closely parallel my own.
1727	I heard as I was coming back into the office after lunch on Tuesday and there was a small group standing around a computer screen watching an internet news feed.
1727	My first reaction was that it had to be some kind of elaborate internet hoax and I still have a sense of disbelief.
1727	I dread my next trip to New York when I will have to see the skyline with my own eyes.
1727	Linda and Amanda are also stranded here and they tend to spend a lot of time watching the news.
1727	After the first hour or so I just couldn't bear to watch and preferred to check in now and then for updates.
1727	But then what else was there to do except sit and be stunned.
1727	Even today it's still hard to concentrate on much of anything.
1727	I guess in a sense I'm lucky that I have work matters to keep me busy.
1727	Unfortunately, some are directly related to the tragedy.
1727	There's no doubt the world changed on Tuesday and this will always be with us in some way.
1727	All sorts of odd thoughts keep coming to mind.
1727	I have wondered several times if Dad remembers when he and I went into one of the towers (it must have been when they were quite new) and tried to get to the top to see the view.
1727	We were told there was no public observation area so we just took an elevator up as far as we could get and got out on a floor that was still under construction and went over to the windows to marvel at the view.
1727	Remember the view from my apartment in New York?
1727	And I was on the QE2 the last time it will ever go past those buildings (forgive the bad grammar but you know what I mean).
1727	We're going to try and have as good a time as possible here.
1727	I'm working during the days and joining Linda and Amanda for dinner in the evening.
1727	Tomorrow we're going to see a West End musical.
1727	Saturday we'll probably go to a couple of museums.
1727	Hope you are keeping well.
1727	Love, Mark
1728	Please let everyone know that they should use the following fax number for me at the office:
1729	From what I have heard, this looks pretty good.
1729	But I wonder if paragraph 1(c) is correct.
1729	Is this what was agreed or should this refer to any spread transaction including a NYMEX, COMEX or Platt's price and another price (whether one of those 3 or not)?
1729	And finally, I don't understand the penultimate paragraph at all but since you guys are closer to the discussions it may make sense to you.
1729	Can you guys confirm this with the traders and report our comments and/or agreement to ISDA?
1729	Thanks!
1729	Mark
1730	While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.
1730	I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.
1730	If so, you may care about this.
1730	My impression is that the Houston commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.
1730	If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let Sara Shackleton or Barbara Gray know as soon as possible.
1731	Sara will be responding from Enron.
1731	She is conferring with the traders this morning.
1732	If you haven't heard back in an hour or so, you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses.
1732	Tana can show you where they sit if you don't already know.
1733	I think Sara Shackleton was the last Enron lawyer to have worked on this.
1734	I was working in the NY office on 9/4 and here in the London office since 9/10.
1735	I am stranded in London - there are worse places these days - but hope to get back tomorrow (Sunday).
1735	Glad you are well.
1736	After a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security -- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in Houston.
1736	I talked to Amanda after I checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport.
1736	Did you have any trouble?
1737	I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.
1737	Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).
1737	Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.
1737	I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.
1737	I will get it for you when I get home.
1737	The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.
1737	In a sense I felt safer in London than here.
1737	Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.
1737	While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.
1737	Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.
1737	The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.
1737	The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.
1737	I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.
1737	On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.
1737	From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.
1737	Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.
1737	For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.
1737	I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.
1737	It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.
1737	The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.
1737	Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.
1737	Good luck!
1737	Mark
1738	Sounds like a plan to me.
1738	Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.
1738	You might try these: In Sedona: Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa) In Scottsdale/Phoenix: Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews) The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool) The Boulders (also highly rated) At the Canyon El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night) In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon): The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon
1739	Looks good to me.
1739	One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.
1739	According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.
1739	If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.
1739	I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).
1740	If you have not already done so this week, please remember to update your work reports for me this afternoon.
1741	I'll be on the call.
1742	Thanks for making my morning.
1742	I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.
1742	I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.
1742	I think that's why they can't dock in ny.
1742	Has Amanda made it back yet?
1743	What about Noble?
1743	Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet?
1744	Example 1 Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a "Loss" to Party A from the termination) Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a "Gain" to Party B from the termination) There are no Unpaid Amounts The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99 Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss) Example 2 Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39 Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain) Let me know if you need any further explanation.
1745	I hope you can all join us for happy hour tomorrow from 6:00 at Christopher's Wine Bar.
1745	Christopher's is located at 2516 Times Blvd.
1745	in Rice Village.
1746	While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.
1746	The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.
1746	The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.
1746	I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?
1746	The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.
1746	If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.
1747	Go for it.
1748	Hopefully just a nuisance.
1749	Looks OK to me.
1750	The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.
1750	I have trouble with the second one.
1750	This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.
1750	Can you call me on this one?
1751	Sounds good to me.
1752	Do you have time to look at this?

1754	Thanks for your note.
1754	Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.
1754	The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.
1754	We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.
1754	This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.
1754	This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).
1754	But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.
1754	Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.
1754	In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.
1754	One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.
1754	As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.
1755	Is P&G approved to trade derivatives online?
1756	I can't be on this call - do you have time?
1757	FYI
1758	No luck here.
1759	If you want to plug me in to your call with Fred to describe the enhanced limit order system, just let me know.
1760	Are the provisions we care about in Title 9?
1761	Sounds like you have this under control.
1761	I agree with your approach.
1762	Please coordinate with Sharon.

1765	Nobody won on Wednesday so the jackpot is up to $33 million.
1765	I'll get us some tickets for tomorrow's drawing.
1766	I just saw the reference to the Gala in the Oct. DW mini calendar.
1766	Congrats!
1766	I'm already looking forward to it.
1766	PS If you're around this weekend, it looks like great sailing weather!
1767	Thanks Sami.
1767	It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.
1767	It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.
1767	Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out.
1768	Joel: Thanks for your note back.
1768	Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.
1768	Do you know yet where you'll be located?
1768	Mark
1769	Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.
1769	Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.
1769	If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.
1769	Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.
1769	As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.
1770	David, Thanks for your note.
1770	Glad to hear you and yours are well.
1770	We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.
1770	I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.
1770	Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.
1770	Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.
1770	I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.
1770	They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.
1770	I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.
1770	Thanks for getting into that.
1770	It sounds like exactly what we needed.
1770	I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.
1770	I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.
1770	Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.
1770	Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.
1770	Mark
1771	OK by me.
1772	Do you have time to work on this?
1773	Thanks Suzanne.
1773	I'll take care of it and give RBS a call tomorrow.
1773	Mark
1774	WELCOME!
1775	Thanks Vela.
1775	My office address is fine.
1775	Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be: 1.
1775	I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.
1775	What happens if it jams in a blow?
1775	2.
1775	Are the heads both electric?
1775	Will they operate manually if you lose power?
1775	3.
1775	The boat seems remarkably well equipped.
1775	What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
1775	4.
1775	How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?
1775	5.
1775	Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.
1775	Any hope of a manufacturing change?
1775	Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft.
1775	Lauderdale!
1775	Mark
1776	Thanks for taking this one.
1777	Sara: How much protection do the agreements give us?
1777	I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.
1777	Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.
1777	I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.
1777	I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.
1777	It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.
1777	Sorry for rambling.
1777	Mark
1778	FYI Looks like we may get free passes to the boat show!

1779	for your assistance.
1779	Sincerely, Lisa Lees Manager EnronOnline Operations
1780	Sara: I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.
1780	I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.
1780	I thought we had until next year sometime.
1780	My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.
1780	Scary, hunh?
1780	Mark
1781	FYI
1782	I hope it was ok to respond to this - because I did.
1783	I'm afraid I have a conflict that day.
1784	Sure.
1785	I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.
1785	If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft.
1785	I'll let you know if it gets to that.
1785	Otherwise I think we're under control.
1785	Mark
1786	Please arrange this for me.
1787	I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.
1787	We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.
1787	We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.
1787	There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.
1787	(It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)
1788	Since they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.
1788	Tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for.
1789	Can you help Bryant with this?
1789	Mary and Sara are both out tomorrow, Brent is supposed to get the form for the Commodity Logic matters finished and Francisco can't really take anything new until Monday.
1789	I don't think Anne and Barbara have enough ISDA experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly.
1789	If you are swamped, maybe you can get this started (I doubt if they even have credit approval yet) and somebody else can take it over next week.
1790	This wasn't on my calendar - were you aware?
1791	This one has sound so be careful.....
1792	I have forwarded these on to Chris Long (who will get back to me on Monday) and left a message for Ken to let him know I will send it on to him as soon as Chris signs off.
1793	Any idea where this stands?
1794	I have received my WorldCom calling card.
1795	I believe credit is trying to decide what to do considering the recent changes in the airlines' positions.
1796	Both of you are listed in Lotus Notes on this one.
1796	Not sure who has had most recent contact.
1796	I someone working on a no-confirms agreement for Chase already?
1797	Any comments to the letter?
1798	It appears this was handled by the Calgary office.
1798	Greg Johnston will give you a call.
1799	That's what I'm hoping, but if not Barbara said she would work on it.
1800	FYI
1801	I'm not sure which version this is but you'll no doubt be revising anyway.
1802	Anne Koehler is probably the best person to talk to.
1802	She has indicated she will have some time in the morning.
1803	We've actually completed this as far as I know -- negotiated the agreement and signed it last week.
1804	How can I tell if someone outside Enron is still using an old address?
1805	Thanks Mark.
1805	I'm not sure who Kim Humbarger is but the topic is at least familiar.
1805	I'll get in touch with her.
1806	That's a relief.
1806	Thanks!
1807	Please remember to get your work report updates to me by the end of the day.
1808	yes
1809	Do I have the receipts for these?
1810	I have a friend who is an allergist but I'm not sure he's any good.
1810	If nobody else comes up with a suggestion I will be happy to give you his name.
1811	OK by me.
1812	To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.
1812	If you have any questions, Tana can probably help.
1813	I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.
1813	He has my name and number if he has any further questions.
1814	Marie - can you please check on this and let Richard know where we stand.
1814	Thanks!
1815	My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.
1815	Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.
1815	Do people eat late in Ft.
1815	Lauderdale?
1815	In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting: Bistro Mezzaluna Armadillo Cafe (Davie) Left Bank Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs) Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach) Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.
1815	All get good marks in Zagats.
1815	Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.
1816	I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.
1816	Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?
1816	Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.
1816	Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat.
1816	and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places?
1817	Has our draft letter gone to the CFTC?
1817	I assume it already has, but unfortunately it turns out Vicki's comments were not in the version of the letter that I forwarded to you.
1817	I have taken a look at them and am not sure they are critical but thought I'd better get them to you in case we send a revised letter down the road.
1818	I was going through some old e-mails and found this one - is this something you have already handled?
1819	Hi George.
1819	I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
1819	I was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read.
1819	I'm living in Houston these days.
1819	I was actually in London on 9/11.
1819	My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.
1819	I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.
1819	I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.
1819	Mark K. is in NYC.
1819	I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.
1819	I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.
1819	I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.
1819	Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.
1819	Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.
1819	Hope you guys are doing well.
1819	Mark
1820	Here is the revised performance evaluation for Cheryl.
1821	I agree with Susan that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in NYC and Houston that the ENA ISDA should be used.
1821	Ms. Zivic had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people).
1822	I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.
1822	My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences.
1823	Since I have to attend the Enron Net Works staff meetings Thursdays at noon, might it be possible to pick a different day?
1824	Are you still taking care of the Portland guys?
1824	Do you have time to look at this?
1825	As long as this remains an internal only document, I do not have any problems with it.
1826	Let's get together with Sara and Mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms.
1827	I don't see why not.
1828	Please see me before responding to Alan.
1828	Thanks, Mark
1829	Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.
1829	Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.
1829	A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.
1830	Here is the revised review (password - oberon).
1830	I have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure I will be able to get out of them at any particular time.
1830	Does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not?
1831	Are we getting this?
1832	Can you take a look at this for the London office?
1833	I may not be able to get there today - can we do the credit card by phone?
1833	Since I bid on several items - can you tell me how much you need?
1834	Is it possible to restrict delete ability?
1834	We need to have a lot of people with write access but they don't all need to be able to delete entire records.
1835	Yes, thanks!
1836	Can you please give me a call to discuss travel plans?
1836	I need to make some reservations today if at all possible.
1837	Please switch to Wednesday, Nov. 7
1838	Thanks for the list.
1838	Francisco Pinto Leite will look at these and get back to you.
1839	Anne's been working too hard.
1839	She meant Financial masters.
1840	Any thoughts on how we provide legal support for Swapco?
1840	Should that be covered by the Services Agreement?
1840	Can lawyers who work for ENA represent Swapco without a conflict?
1841	Contact Stephen Douglas re: Bill Bradford deal.
1841	Otherwise none.
1842	Thanks.
1843	If Man is not holding margin in violation of the Customer Agreement, it doesn't seem to me like we should send the letter.
1844	I ma leaving for the evening but was hoping we might get together for a bit tomorrow some time to go over where things stand on Swapco and what needs to be done.
1844	Can you leave a voice mail for me on 713-853-7459 letting me know what your schedule is like for tomorrow and when would work best for you?
1845	Risk Management & Trading Corp., a Delaware corporation
1846	I will not be able to attend.
1847	Can Swapco buy an existing bank account from ENE, pay $5000 and sign a bank account sale document in the process?
1848	Add Christian Yoder and Carol St Clair to list.
1849	Under normal circumstances we would not need an Enron Corp. resolution and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an Enron Corp. Board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.
1849	The other resolutions we can get in place easily.
1849	I think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean we need to issue the Golden Share today?
1850	Under normal circumstances the Enron Treasury group would invest cash on deposit in something like overnight commercial paper obligations or something like that.
1850	Can we let them do that with ERMT's money?
1850	Would we need a written authorization to ENE to do that (we don't usually do that for other subsidiaries)?
1851	I'm not sure.
1851	There was a comment by Sally Beck at the last meeting that she was trying to figure out which of her direct reports should be attending so maybe it has something to do with that.
1851	I don't really know what changed though.
1852	We have a few items to add in the Services Agmt.
1852	as services to be provided: Risk assessment and control services including, without limitation, credit, underwriting and market risk analysis.
1852	Risk management services including, without limitation, position and limit reporting and price curve validation.
1852	Transaction confirmation, settlement, scheduling, dispatch and volume management.
1852	Human resources support including, without limitation, payroll, compensation and benefits.
1852	Public relations, legal, corporate records, and regulatory and government affairs.
1852	Travel and aviation.
1852	At the end of the current section 2.1(vi) please add "including, but not limited to, SAP."
1852	Finally, we need to include Enron Corp. and Enron Net Works as parties providing services (e.g. Enron Corp. is where risk assessment is, Net Works has all of the IT).
1853	Louise just wants global natural gas and power.
1853	I think we should throw in "related products" just to be safe.
1854	Can you take a quick look at this?
1855	FYI
1856	One more thing we need to consider is office space.
1856	Can I just add that in as a "service"?
1857	Thanks Stuart, I'll add it in. Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?
1858	Thanks - can you guys draft up the Schedule I on a cost-plus basis?
1859	We have reservations at Damian's at 7:30.
1859	3011 Smith Street Directions fromt he Hobby area: Take I-45 N toward downtown Exit number 45 SCOTT ST/ DOWNTOWN Keep LEFT on the ramp then go straight to go onto ST.
1859	JOSEPH PKWY.
1859	Turn LEFT onto SMITH ST.
1859	10 or 11 blocks to just before the corner of Anita/Smith restuarant is on your left.
1859	(713)206-8080 (cell)
1860	You can confirm that it is not regulated and send a copy of cert.
1860	of incorp.
1860	which Deb Korkmas should have if Tana doesn't
1861	Louise and John have asked for execution copies of all the Swapco documents.
1861	All I need for the Services Agreement is the Fee Schedule.
1861	Any progress on the License?
1862	sure
1863	I think he's asking the wrong question.
1863	Can you help him out?
1864	Would one of you please give me a call in my office.
1864	I can't get through on Stuart's cell.
1865	These documents need to have the correct directors names added so they can be signed first thing in the morning.
1866	These are the good ones.
1867	Just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like I'll be able to make it to NY this weekend as previously planned.
1867	I'll let you know if that changes.
1867	Mark
1868	Thanks David -- I appreciate that.
1868	I'm thinking when this all calms down, I'll just take a couple of days off and come up to the city for fun -- not wait for a business trip.
1868	I'll give you a ring if anything really interesting comes up.
1869	Yes, we might as well get one.
1870	John Lavorato, Mark Haedicke and Mike McConnell
1871	That's what he goes by.
1872	Thanks for the offer.
1872	At this moment, looks like I'm not going to make it at all, much less tonight.
1872	I'll let you know if that changes, I'm proceeding minute to minute here.
1873	Thanks for your message.
1873	Is there a number where I can call you?
1874	Thanks for your note.
1874	We're hanging in there.
1875	I can get the NETCO document signed but don't know anything about CGNN.
1875	Who should I give that to?
1876	I honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed.
1876	I expect these are part of other efforts where I am not on the "need to know" list.
1876	If you know another Enron lawyer involved in those efforts I suggest you try them.
1877	Net Works is not a marketing affiliate.
1877	We can make changes if they want us to.
1878	Thanks for the note -- not to worry about the music.
1878	I didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway.
1878	Thanks for the thought.
1878	It's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch.
1878	Mark
1879	TEST
1880	Congrats on having your letter published.
1880	I've always wondered -- do they edit the letters much?
1881	Thanks for your note.
1881	I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.
1881	I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.
1881	Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.
1881	Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.
1881	I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.
1881	Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B. I hope she is doing better.
1881	It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.
1881	In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.
1881	Things had gotten very bad.
1881	Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.
1881	At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.
1881	It's nice you have Key West to get away to.
1881	You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.
1881	It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.
1881	I was supposed to go to Ft.
1881	Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.
1881	That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.
1881	I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.
1881	With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.
1881	I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.
1881	Tell Don I said Hi.
1881	Mark
1882	I haven't had any complaints from the post office.
1882	In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.
1882	It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement.
1882	It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.
1882	When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.
1882	Has there been a problem?
1882	On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.
1882	I'll keep you posted.
1882	Mark
1883	Sorry about that.
1883	I have been a bit preoccupied.
1883	I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.
1883	It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.
1883	You should have them tomorrow.
1884	Here are the documents we discussed.
1885	I think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for - just be very careful to try and minimize expenses.
1886	A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters): 1.
1886	How many (who?) have responded to this?
1886	Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
1886	2.
1886	Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).
1887	Does your analysis change if the license is expanded to include both source and object code licenses with the right to the licensee grant sublicenses?
1888	let's cancel
1889	No gifts, thank you -- just a social hour.
1890	In my view an assignment is the common legal method for accomplishing a sale and purchase of a derivative transaction.
1890	If they want to use sale terminology that is fine but the assignment language should also be there.
1891	If you need to reach me this weekend, I will be at my parent's home in Cincinnati: (513)541-8649.
1892	Hey Mike -- here are my details: Mark E. Taylor '78 1322 Rutland St. (713)863-7190 (home) Let me know how I can help.
1893	I thought of another item to add to the list: Cruising World 2002 wall calendar -- available on Amazon.com for 11.95
1894	Yet another idea: A flashlight that has a magnet on the side (or some kind of clamp) to keep in the trunk of the car.
1894	This one might be good for Tim, too.
1895	Thanks for the idea -- I may need it sooner than I expected.
1895	It's nice to know there are jobs out there but I think I can hold out until I find one somewhere better than Boise -- if you thought nobody wanted to visit Houston|
1896	There have been some ongoing disputes with AEP I think we should look into before cooperating fully.
1896	I'll check with Elizabeth Sager and get back to you.
1897	I called the Moorings about a Miami charter over New Year's and they said they are shutting down the entire location as of 11/30!
1897	When I asked about any other locations that might still have boats left, she said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time.
1897	Sorry.
1898	I think there is a real possibility here.
1898	It would be extremely challenging commercially.
1898	How do we convince customers to participate?
1898	Two distinct areas: (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.
1898	New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?
1898	Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.
1898	Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.
1898	But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?
1898	This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.
1898	Issues: Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
1898	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
1898	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
1898	Contract hurdles: Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
1898	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
1898	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).
1898	If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?
1898	It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.
1898	That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.
1898	Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?
1898	If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.
1898	(Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?) Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.
1898	If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.
1898	When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.
1898	Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.
1899	Here is the Electronic Trading Agreement we discussed.
1900	Sally still ahs not received the list.
1900	Do you have it in a form you can e-mail to her?
1901	Just to let you guys know...
1901	I'm working like an animal here but at least I'm still employed.
1901	Every now and then I kinda wish I'd been one of those laid off last week instead of the one who had to tell people they were no longer employed but I don't have enough to retire on any more so I guess I still need the job!
1901	Hope you guys are doing well.
1901	Any plans for New Years?
1902	Sorry Joe, I haven't seen this one.
1902	Have you tried Elizabeth?

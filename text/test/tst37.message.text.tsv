14	Girl, so now you see!
14	Karen just has issues!
14	So how are you doing?
14	I was on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today.
14	We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion.
14	The weather was great compared to Texas.
14	Texas is so hot!!
14	How's Christian doing?
14	My boys are doing pretty good, just growing so fast.
14	Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance.
14	See ya!
15	Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.
15	I came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.
15	I was furious and I still am furious.
15	Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i came back.
15	I really don't want to talk to him right now.
15	I'll keep you posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!
15	See you later.
16	Hi Calvin I spoke with Rickey (boy, is he long-winded!!).
16	Gave him the name of our credit guy, Russell Diamond.
16	Thank for your help!
17	Hi, How's it going?
17	You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week.
17	We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week.
17	Sometimes the Tuesday night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys, that sometimes we spend Wednesday recuperating (i.e. getting the boys and myself to bed early).
17	It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep them.
17	Girl, what did you think of that Jon P. Kee song that Joe and that girl were singing on Tuesday.
17	The choir really wasn't into that one.
17	We just could not muster up a good sound!
17	Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony?
17	If so, let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to the tent!
17	I'm 75% sure that I will be attending.
17	Talk to you later.
18	I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a room at Embassy Suites for $39 per night.
18	It's supposed to be at I-17 and Greenway, wherever that is.
18	I'll belive that when I see it.
18	I probably will not bring the kids, it just seems like such a hassle.
18	I can understand Mom not wanting to miss work, so it seems like it will be a girls weekend.
18	I have not checked on flight arrangements yet, but I'll let you know.
18	I still want to leave on Thursdat night, so we have time for site seeing.
18	How much was the ticket?
19	I think we should all stay in the same room, especially if we get a suite at embassset suites, with a pull-out bed.
19	We checked it out and I can get there are 7:30 p.m.
19	on America West on Thursday.
19	The rate is $305.00, a little pricey.
19	Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal dinner?
19	I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see.
20	Give me another couple of days, we're still checking.
20	Did I tell you that Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she could pay for Shawna's wedding, as well as take care of her business.
20	So you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding, (girl, you know how that goes, now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of money?) You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real estate, or something like that.
20	Ralph West came to our groundbreaking ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette.
20	He is awesome.
20	I told him I enjoyed his sermon, and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the next day.
20	Do you have acrobat on your computer?
20	I'll try to send you picture to see if it comes out.
20	Talk with you later.
21	Hi Dexter!
21	Here you are!
22	So nice to hear from you.
22	Everything here is hot, hot, hot, 107 degrees today.
22	Nothing new going on here, the boys are doing great, just getting really big.
22	I'm taking Kendall to the Dr. today to see if he has an ear infection, he was up most of the night last night (rats!).
22	Jordan is so cool, he taking gynmastics again and loving it.
22	Kendall is my little roughneck!, he reminds me of myself, he's hysterical.
22	I am so glad I have them!!!!
22	The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun, I think it's just going to be Mom, Me and Nelle I think.
22	I'm leaving the kids with Todd.
22	Todd has a new job where he works 12 hour shifts.
22	In fact, he's working with Ken Cowan, but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am, It sucks when he's working nights, but he really likes it.
22	Anyway, we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to roll.
22	Anyway take care, talk with you soon!
23	I have booked my flights, I leave on Thursday, November 2nd at 5:45 p.m.
23	and arrive in Phoenix at 7:31 p.m.
23	on Continental.
23	I leave on Sunday at 11:27 a.m. and arrive in Houston at 3:00 p.m.
23	How was the picnic?
23	We finally got some decent weather yesterday and its supposed to continue through the weekend.
23	See you later.
24	Hi Susan Attached, please find the list of contracts with contract numbers.
24	Please provide as soon as you can, and if you don't mind, can you please give me an estimated time.
24	Many thanks
25	Russell, will you please update me on the status of the Alliance Pipeline Corporate Guarantee?
25	We need to have this guarantee as soon as possible, as we would like to begin flow on September 13, 2000.
25	Thank you
26	Hey Melba, This is the description I need for the new product: The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and ANR Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois I need this product set up ASAP, so let me know.
26	Thanks so much and sorry for the rush!!!!
27	Melba Please set up the following new delivery points: 1) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Midwestern Gas Transmission Company located in Will County, Illinois 2) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America located in Grundy County, Illinois 3) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Nicor Gas Company located in Grundy County, Illinois 4) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company located in Will County, Illinois 5) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois I'd like to have these the Natural Gas Pipeline point set up yet today, as I think we will probably start to trade this point tomorrow.
27	Thank you.
28	Hi Rev. Jackson How's it going?
28	I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?
28	Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.
28	I'll be leaving at 5:00 directly.
28	See you tonight!
29	Good afternoon Rev. Jackson.
29	So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured out.
29	Hope your day is going well.
29	Sometime, please tell me what "A Day in the Life of Rev. Jackson" is like at SWCBC.
29	Do you see alot of people all day long (during the day)?
29	So often, it's hard to picture the church as being active all day long.
29	It just seems like people attend meetings and services about twice a week in the evenings.
29	Funny, how we get perceptions in our heads.
29	My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my "book" here at work and it sure feels good.
29	I've always remembered what you told me during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind.
29	The one that I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in perfect peace".
29	I take that with me everywhere I go.
29	Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.
29	Appreciate it!
30	Hi Jewel, Sorry, I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day, but things have been extremely busy around here, and plus, there is very little room for privacy.
30	In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.
30	Back in the day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.
30	I think it's one of those things that once you "get your foot in the door", you can move on from there.
30	Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.
30	As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he has time to visit with you.
30	I think that by simply expressing an interest, and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.
30	Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.
30	They're actually pretty good about that!
30	I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.
30	Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!
30	Take care!
31	Judy, I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the following contracts: Wisconsin Power & Light 96045691 Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you, just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).
31	Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.
31	We have no idea what it is, and we're looking for the non-performance language associated with it.
31	Thanks!
32	Here are the rates that Midwestern and NGPl gave to me about a week ago.
32	I'll double-check the rates this afternoon.
32	Talk with you later
33	Just tried to call you.
33	Please call me before you leave, and yes, you probably need to leave, but where will you go?
33	If you go straight hme, emotions are running too high for it to be a safe environment right now.
33	I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right now.
33	You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we normally would not do.
33	Please do not put yourself in that position!!!!
33	Please call me!
34	Hey Home, Just a note to tell you thanks again for being my "roaddog".
34	It really helped me out!
34	You're the "bomb"!
35	Hey baby, Getting back to the Alliance issue, what is happening.
35	I know I have my nerve because I was supposed to provide a list.
35	Sorry, I forgot, but anyway.....................here's a list: PGLC Dave Wear 312-240-4554 Duke John Alrich 713-260-8578 You know the rest.
35	Call me when you get a chance
36	Girl, you know he's lying.
36	He's a trip, but it was a good sermon.
37	Thanks for the note.
37	Will you work tomorrow and the weekend?
38	Where are you going?
39	I just sent you along e-mail, let me know if it came over, I hope so, it took me 20 minutes to type it!
40	Thanks for the note, that was very sweet of you.
40	I always believe in helping wherever I can, b/c the next day it'll be me!
41	How are you?
41	Hope everything is going well.
41	Did you receive my response to your last e-mail?
41	I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not.
41	Nothing new going on here.
41	I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th.
41	I really haven't made any plans, but maybe we'll go visit my family in Omaha.
41	It's really hard for me to plan, b/c I may have to work some of the week.
41	I'm not sure yet, so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be interrupted.
41	Church services were really good this past sunday, Pastor preached a good sermon.
41	Talk with you later
42	Girl, you are good, how much do I owe?
43	Hi Nellie, What's happening?
43	I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.
43	I made the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is $159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can split it three ways.
43	Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.
43	Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.
43	I spoke with Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from her yet, nor am I holding my breath.
43	She said her colors are burgundy and gold, if I remember correctly.
43	Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group.
43	This class is called the "Hope Team" and it gets the kids ready for competition.
43	I did not realize he was that good, although I could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).
43	I called to inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!"
43	Well, anyway, we'll see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.
43	each day.
43	We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it.
43	Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.
43	I was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).
43	I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.
43	Let me know what you're hearing?
43	Talk to you later.
44	Hi, Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here, just huge price moves.
44	Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.
44	As far as Alliance gas is concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.
44	So make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already know about it.
44	Anne's number is 403-517-6270.
44	She will be calling each Morning.
44	My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.
44	Please look at the Nigas Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.
44	My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2 days.
44	If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).
44	P.S.
44	I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara # 436296.
44	He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise.
44	His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.
44	I'll be back on Wednesday.
45	When I remember to put a new book oif checks in my purse, do you want me to make it out to you or give you cash!
46	Okay, I'll send it via the mail.
46	I like your new hair style, it looks good!
47	Can we make sure we set up that appointment today?
47	Let me know.
48	yes, cool!
49	Chicago is $0.125 an Dawn is $.245.
50	That's so sweet of you to let me know, but we will not be there this weekend, we just went about two weekends ago.
50	I'm thinking about taking the kids to this farm out in my part of town.
50	My understanding is that it is open to the public, but I'm trying to get the name of the place.
50	Diane Cook has taken her kids there, so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info.
50	Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!!!
50	(He'll probably be scared to death once we get there!) I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday.
50	What costumes did the kids where?
51	Yes, that's fine!
51	--- Is it inside the terminal or do I have to drag around on a bus to find it.
51	You know the cheap ones are like that!
52	Here is a copy of my itinerary.
52	Please forward acopy of yours so that we may coordinate.
52	Thanks
53	Hey baby!!!
53	Here you go!!!
54	Sorry, forgot the attachment!
55	November, 2000 prices
56	Sorry, I arrive on Continental 1505 at 7:31 p.m.
56	and I leave on Sunday at 11:30 p.m.
56	on Continental.
57	Hey girl, I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!
57	It's been up and down over here, but I'm hanging!
57	Hope everything is going well with you.
57	Did the kids enjoy Halloween?
57	My kids sure did.
57	I did not realize that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.
57	I wasn't going anyway!
57	Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be back on Sunday afternoon.
57	Talk with you later.
58	Girl, I'm on my way to the airport in about 15 minutes!
58	I'll leave the phone on!
59	Hey Girl, I'm back and I had a wonderful time.
59	Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to get around in. The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a result I have a little cold and sore throat.
59	The wedding was very nice.
59	The wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.
59	The reception was "the bomb".
59	It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, money.
59	I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.
59	She had a reception for around 150 to 250 people.
59	I'm not good at looking at a crowd and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.
59	She had a buffet dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.
59	It was really nice.
59	Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was nice.
59	She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.
59	We went shopping and sight-seeing.
59	We even went to go find the grade school that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix many, many years ago.
59	It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know what word I'm trying to say).
59	Did you go to church Sunday?
59	If so, how was it?
59	I really did miss not going to church.
59	How was the rest of your weekend?
59	Kids and Steve doing okay?
59	I can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.
59	Talk to you later.
59	I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me when we get the kids wound down!
60	Boy, it looks like this is really going to be a tight, tight, race.
60	As far as your other issue, I would just say very professionally, that "there are 3 subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about, and they are voting, religion and salaries."
60	and just keep it at that.
60	You also might want to add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects."
60	That way, you've communicated your desires in a concise, professional manner.
60	Talk to you later!
61	Girl, isn't that sad about the election results and the recount.
61	It's really terrible.
61	Everybody over here is watching it very, very closely.
61	They really want Bush to win in a bad way.
61	I'm tired of hearing about it!
61	How are things over your way.
61	My day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I was shocked, but appreciative.
61	I think I might go car shopping this weekend if the weather is nice.
61	Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million dollar house?
61	Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it probably was correct!
61	We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days.
61	I want to see this house!
61	Talk to you later.
62	Hi Mark, I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance Pipeline.
62	As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.
62	As with any new pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.
62	I would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.
62	Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.
62	I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.
62	Thank you
63	When you here from Hope, please let me know what she says about Greg's house and get the address and I'll print out the MapQuest.
64	Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.
64	You know how they have the news on around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a wrong or right issue".
64	Always trying to rhyme!
64	Can you believe that idiot.
64	I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.
64	I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.
64	If you're an authority on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.
64	He's something else.
64	He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!!
65	What's up with this guy.
65	I guess he called Mr. Palmer.
65	How did that come about!
65	He really feels as though he's been mistreated.
65	I don't understand him!
66	Hey girl, What's happening?
66	Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that I will never, ever go back over to that church again.
66	It's a nice, small church, but those folks crack me up.
66	Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.
66	This time, those fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey.
66	They're fools!
66	I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!
66	So, just remind me, I will never go back over there.
66	I sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool!
66	Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.
66	Last night, Todd cleaned out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.
66	I was a little unnerved, especially with the kids.
66	I had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.
66	I was a praying sister.
66	That really scared me.
66	Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this morning!
66	Oh well, talk with you later!
67	Hey Rev. Jackson, Hello sir, how are you?
67	Well, I tell you Pastor really outdid himself yesterday.
67	I really enjoyed his sermon.
67	He really has a knack for weaving a story and making it applicable to today's events, etc. Tasha and I got so tickled, watching you sing that song.
67	You did very well.
67	We said, "Look at Rev. Jackson, he's jammin".
67	Well, anyway, talk to you later!
68	So hello, What happened at rehearsal last night?
68	I did not make it, partly because I was tired and I had several errands to take care of.
68	I needed to stop by K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed, and just did not want to be out late.
68	Let me know!!!
68	Talk to you later.
68	P.S.
68	is everthing else going okay?
69	Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.
69	In fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.
69	Are you free?, are they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.
69	What did they say?
70	That's news to me!
70	I don't think I like Razoo's.
70	I'll have to see if I'm available.
71	So, I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !
71	Robin and Anna have the strangest way of doing things.
71	I asked Robin at least two weeks ago, and she said she had to get with Anna, and now she's telling you that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to me.
71	Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again, because at this point, I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night, and he'll be tired on Saturday (although that's no problem).
71	But, like last time, I don't want to go if you can't go.
71	Let me try and call her and we'll talk later.
71	So are you free on Saturday?
71	Also, everything is going okay over here, the market is down severely this morning, so we'll see!
72	Hey thanks for the info.
72	Ann, from Alliance, said that 160,000 MMBtu/d went to Peoples, so, it's all making sense.
72	Thanks again!
73	I can't do anything on Tuesday nights, but let me know about Monday.
73	I just need a couple of days notice.
74	Hey guys, Here is the activity sheet for November.
74	All activity is for the Balancing Agreement only!!!!!
74	I am planning to inject approximately 15,000 MMBtu per day for the rest of the month and that should put me in a pretty good position.
74	Please respond when you have a minute.
74	Thanks
75	Sorry, it took so long!
75	It's kind of hard to say, but just say that during an altercation ......, but you do not have to say with who, I really don't know, but let me know what you come up with.
75	How much detail are they looking for with the Police report!
76	This is super fantastic!!!
76	See, it all pays off!
76	I can't wait to talk with you and find out more about it!
76	Let me know if you are rolling tonight!
77	We sold Steve a package of 10,000 at the Nipsco city gate.
77	Thanks for your help!
78	It's about time, but well worth the wait.
78	He's is soooooo cute!
79	Bobbi, Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November, 2000.
79	I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both the firm and interruptible.
79	Those schedules will probably be revised once we get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".
79	Thanks
80	Attached are the Chicago prices.
80	The Michcon and Consumers are coming later.
81	No, but let me see what I can come up with.
81	It's early now, so it will be about another hour before they start to show up here in the office.
81	I'll let you know.
82	Greg set me up a nice little sheet.
82	So here is the updated version with new volumes!
83	Please see attached!
84	Girl, you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .
84	Now you know I don't know.
84	It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead.
84	He probably won't spring it on you Sunday, because we did not do that good without you there.
84	I am so tired from last night.
84	Everything is so rushed, and I did not get the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m. I'm tired, so I know they are.
84	On top of all of that, the market is up another $1.00 today (yeah!!), but we have to stay late tonight to go over our positions as a group.
84	My boss said that we will all stay until it's done, so make arrangements.
84	Naturally, Todd is working the evening shift, so I'm trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter.
84	They just live right down the street.
84	So we'll see!
84	Talk with you later!
85	Hi Melba, While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a new product called: NGPL North Shore Gas Company.
85	The description should be: The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North Shore Gas Company .
85	It should be mapped to Chicago.
85	I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.
85	Thanks for your help!
85	P.S.
85	Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.
85	Thanks
86	Please attached!
87	What's happening?
87	I know you've been busy, I remembered that Thursday night is Ciera's (spelling?) review night.
87	Everything is well here at work and at home.
87	I 'm leaving early today, probably, around 3:00 p.m.
87	We've had a pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week..
87	Next week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest, so it will really be a busy work week.
87	I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today, whether it be late tonight (you know they're open until 11:00 p.m. I think) or right after work.
87	I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha if I make it out.
87	Do you want to go in on it, I was going to spend about $25 (believe me, she is looking for a gift!).
87	Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party?
87	We're still going to mine, but girl, we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field.
87	My regular babysitter could not do it.
87	Anyway, holler at me!
88	See Attached
89	How are you doing today?
89	Boy, isn't it cold!!!!!!
89	I don't think I will be at choir rehearsal tonight because of work.
89	Isn't the Christmas program Sunday?
89	I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.
89	We've only had two non-dedicated practices for the program.
89	We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not being able to get in tomorrow morning.
89	It's supposed to rain or lightly mist tonight between 11:00 p.m.
89	and 8:00 a.m. The streets are supposed to be treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you might want to talk with your supervisor to come up with a contingency plan for the weather.
89	Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!
90	Hey Daddy, What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!!
90	Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight.
90	So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.
90	So needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.
90	The boys are going over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I will just stay downtown.
90	I understand that you guys had some bad weather as well, I know Mom was out of school.
90	I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it so much.
90	Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.
90	Todd bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.
90	It's really cute.
90	On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.
90	It was just a new experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.
90	Anyway, I'll send your tape.
90	See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis Love Bernie
91	Scott, Finally, here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April, 1999.
91	Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs. $2.74 on 10,000 MMBtu per day.
91	If this is true, please pay the difference of $0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April, 1999.
91	If your understanding is different, please let me know, but otherwise please pay the difference.
91	Thank you for your patience, and sorry it took so long to resolve.
92	Hi Darla, Could you please help me out?
92	Someone from Nicor called me last week and said we had a discrepancy for September business.
92	All he said was that there is a difference of $176,836 that we owe them.
92	Can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is?
92	Thanks for your help.
93	I really don't remember the name, but it was a man.
93	He specifically quoted dollar amounts of $9,475.808.18 vs. $9,298,971.71.
93	Hope this helps!
93	Thank you very much1
94	The lady's name is Charlene Jackson.
94	I don't know here, but give her a call and check it out.
94	See you Sunday!
95	I heard they closed the schools because of too much snow!
95	What's it look like?
96	What's happening?
96	How's your day going so far?
96	Mine is pretty good so far, we'll see at 2:10 p.m.
96	when the Nymex closes.
96	Are you doing rehearsal tonight?
96	I still need to get me a good black dress, I really liked your red dress.
96	I need something on that order .
96	See you later!!!!
97	Yes, I'll see you there!
98	Call id you have any discrepancies.
98	Thanks
99	Oh Hope, So nice to hear from you!
99	I think about you all the time.
99	I miss not seeing you every Tuesday!
99	Are you considering coming back any time soon?
99	If not, I certainly understand, we are so "messy".
99	We just finished "Take it to the Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year.
99	We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day.
99	A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that morning.
99	I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe.
99	I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that big, and it sits so high, whoa!!
99	I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and everything is going great for you.
99	We'll have to get together and do a "afternoon at the park" with the kids.
99	Take care.
99	Love ya!
99	P.S.
99	Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often!
100	Hi Dan This memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 3,000 MMBtu's per day to National Steel for the above referenced time period.
100	Deliveries will be at the NGPL Nipsco City Gate.
100	Call if you have further questions.
100	Thanks
101	You go girl, you're in my prayers!
102	Hi Monique, We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.
102	Natasha and I attend the same church and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same place.
102	What a coincidence!
102	To top it all off, I received an e-mail from Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to send her an e-mail".
102	Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.
102	I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, and a black liquid eyeliner.
102	Please let me know if you have these items in stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!
102	Thank you so much.
102	Patrice
103	sounds perfect, -- do you need cash or is a check okay?
104	Thank you, my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out.
104	Thanks again!
105	Hey, I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there you were.
105	Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see where it ends up.
105	Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.
105	He still is extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.
105	I suspect that there is alot that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.
105	But I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.
105	I'm going down there next month.
105	We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.
105	Todd wants to drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.
105	He's drive us crazy!
105	Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are you off?
105	I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, but she's hanging in there.
105	See you later!
106	Hey Greg, Please forward to Ms. Bobbi.
106	Thank you
107	I already purchased the vehicle.
107	Thank you
108	Hi Melba, Will you please create a new product that reads as follows: The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois.
108	I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.
108	I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.
108	Thanks Melba!
109	Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal tonight!!!!!
109	Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in the audience, but did not see you.
109	After church let out, I was gone, I was home by 1:15 p.m.
109	That never happens!
109	I looked for you guys and I said, oh well, I'll catch them later.
109	By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway, Yes I'm having it on a Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and Jordan has his heart set on it.
109	It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy!
109	So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m.
109	and be out of there by 8:30 p.m.
109	It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday or a Sunday.
109	I'm just inviting about 6 people.
109	so it'll definitely be small Let me know if you're interested.
109	See you soon!.
110	Thank you.
110	You may call the other product NGPL Nicor GDD.
110	Thanks again!
111	Just wanted to confirm that you guys are available on Friday night for Jordan's party.
111	You never did call me back!
112	It will be at 6:45 p.m.
112	Todd had such a fit because it was on a Monday, which I prefer!
113	Hey lady, Just in case you are interested, I changed Jordan's party to this Friday night at 6:45 p.m.
113	same place.
113	Love ya!
114	Cool girl, that'll work out fine.
114	It sounds like Hope will be attending also.
114	Kenny can't come, so that was disappointing, but I'll see him on Saturday for his daughter's party.
114	Talk with you later.
114	We need to talk!!!!
115	Hope, You're the Best!!!!!!
116	Oh no, nothing urgent, I just feel like i take one step forward and two steps backward, you know the drill!
117	Hi Priscilla, These deals are a mess, I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, can't remember all the details.
117	I will speak with our Calgary office, as well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you ASAP.
117	Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith is out of the office until Monday.
117	Thanks,
118	Well, go with Startech's invoice.
118	Thanks
119	Hey Gang, I've called the trader at Sempra and she is researching and will let us know something, hopefully, this afternoon.
119	Thanks
120	I'm thinking that I have probably missed you, but anyway, it was so nice to hear from you.
120	We're haviing Jordan's birthday party tonight.
120	So thwat's what we'll be doing this weekend!
120	Talk to you soon!
120	Love Bernie
121	Grant, Please review and let' discuss how to resolve.
121	Thanks
122	Hey girl, You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.
122	I called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.
122	I cracked up!
122	Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.
122	That reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.
122	I answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She said, oh that's for me".
122	I cracked up!
122	Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice.
122	Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?
122	He's back down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.
122	He's turned into a nice looking young man.
122	I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.
122	She seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.
122	I'll call her back one of these days when I have more time.
122	Missed you at Jordan's party.
122	Silly me, I didn't figure it out until Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.
122	I initially thought it was from Shayla.
122	Well anyway, you rolling?
123	Hey Kenny.
123	Thanks for checking on me.
123	My trip to Omaha was okay.
123	On one hand, it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in. It's not real good, but he feels optimistic.
123	You know he has prostate cancer and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.
123	He's very, very weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out.
123	Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).
123	He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.
123	He is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in half the time.
123	It's really sad.
123	He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good spirits I guess.
123	To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.
123	It's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that I would not worry.
123	It's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering.
123	He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, along with lots of prayer.
123	Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't want her to do it.
123	Daddy says he's going back to work.
123	Please pray for Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.
123	Talk to you later!
124	How did it go with Lil' Steve.
124	Were you able to get his fever reduced?
124	Poor thing, I hope he's feeling better.
124	How Siera?
124	Well, anyway, just was thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line.
124	Are you rehearsing tonight?
125	Sorry, I got a little trigger happy!
126	P.S.
126	Kelli is going to send the Midcontinent volumes & prices.
127	I plan to withdraw 500,000 for the month, I will revise sheet as we revise the volumes, but the plan is to withdraw 500,000.
127	Thanks
128	I bought a car, please do not e-mail me anymore!
129	Hey girl, Where are the pictures, they were not attached.
129	I'll call you this afternoon.
129	Patrice
130	Hi Daddy, I was thinking about you earlier this morning.
130	Glad to hear that you are not in any pain right now.
130	We just need to keep pressing to find the right combination of medicine.
130	My experience has been to be very persistent with the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.
130	I've learned alot with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not communicate.
130	I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for pain and discomfort when, most times, there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done.
130	I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your "breakthrough" on the radio.
130	I told her, if only the audience knew what you were talking about!
130	I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were closed,I forgot about the time difference.
130	I 'm probably hesitating because I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this is the right place.
130	What are your thoughts?
130	Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt". Hope it's not too painful. Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening. Is this your home e-mail or your office?
131	Hey girl, How's it going?
131	Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days.
131	I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home until 11:00 p.m.
131	By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight and I was sick about keeping them up that late.
131	Last night, I went to the grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and cheese and green beans.
131	After we relaxed for a while, we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.
131	I was exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.
131	I woke up around 1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.
131	I was tired.
131	This evening I made a nail appointment.
131	My nails look like "do-do".
131	I would like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for that.
131	Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.
131	Talk with you later!
132	Alright, I'll check into both places.
132	I thought you were going to the Dr. today?
132	After I typed this, I said to myself, I guess I could have re--read your original memo.
132	Anyway, how often do you check your e-mail at home, because I can start using this to talk to you?
133	Do you all have any rodeo tickets?
133	I'm thinking about going to stand in line?
133	I want to see Destiny's Child, what about you?
134	Just checking up on you to see how you're feeling.
134	Are you feeling alright?
134	How did the last test go?
135	Did you check with Steve about the rodeo on February 18th?
135	I want to try to get tickets this evening.
135	Talk to you later.
136	That is WONDERFUL!!!!!!
137	Hi Shielah, I agree with changing the deal to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily-Daily Flat for the December 22-26 time period.
137	Please ask Julie to change the ticket, I always get confused.
137	Thanks
138	I don't know where that came from, it's old, but it reminds me of that song, "Hey Little Walter!"
138	My dad called last night and he had a terrific day on Sunday.
138	GOD is good!
139	Hi I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively.
139	Hunter will be out of the office on Tuesday, and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on that same afternoon.
139	Thank you for the invitation!
140	Hi there!
140	Just checking on you.
140	Did you make it to practice last night and did Lucretia's husband keep the kids?
140	(smile).
140	If so, what time did you get back home, I know it was late.
140	I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids.
140	They did not have much, and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.
140	I was looking for western shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a Western store on Gessner.
140	Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.
140	Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.
140	I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear.
140	I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on my headphones.
140	It sure helps alot.
140	I can get away with it, because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear headphones to hear, so it looks good.
140	Plus, the boss doesn't mind.
140	We listen to music just about all day anyway.
140	Have you heard the Chester D.T. Baldwin tape.
140	I think it's one of my favorites.
140	Speaking of gospel, is your family still planning on doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion?
140	I was wondering about that!
140	Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her business.
140	Talk with you later!
141	Just in case, I have not made it real PLAIN, you deliver an AWESOME Video, It is extremely professional, easy to follow, and concise!
141	Keep up the GOOD WORK!
141	Thanks again!!!
142	Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?
142	Were you trying to e-mail me yesterday?
142	I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as well?
142	I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.
142	They seem to be fine.
142	Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.
142	You know I always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.
142	The number is 713-851-6240.
142	When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but anyother time, it's most always on.
142	And of course, my pager number is on my business card.
142	Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.
142	Talk with you soon.
143	So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.
143	I can't wait until we can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.
143	We're always so busy, "A woman's work is never done".
143	I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.
143	I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, President's Day?
143	I'm off and can't wait.
143	I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child.
143	Love you!!
144	As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA.
144	and just renting a house on the beach.
144	I've never been there, but have heard a few good things about it.
144	I'm trying to get more information before I go ahead and book a house.
144	Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.
144	God is good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.
144	Have you made any plans yet?
144	If you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.
144	Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY.
144	They all seem to get along real well.
144	So my girl, has good taste.
144	I knew she had it in her.
144	I really, really like my Tahoe.
144	I wish I had bought it sooner.
144	It took me about a month to get used to it, but now I'm rolling.
144	Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.
144	I would love to get together again.
145	Yes, it is working, you're up early this morning, it's not even noon yet.
145	You must be feeling good today!
146	In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of this transaction.
146	The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.
146	The transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel of 1%.
146	Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct procedure.
146	Thanks for your help.
146	P.S.
146	I do agree with your last e-mail .
147	Hey, How's it going today?
147	I've been thinking about you and Siera.
147	Did things go alright last night.
147	Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow?
147	I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk to you tonight.
147	Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.
147	I thought that was funny, he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.
147	He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because I was a generous contributor.
147	I then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.
147	By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.
147	That's interesting.
147	I can only imagine what happened there!
147	Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?
147	I have some, but it's old, and I had been thinking about buying something new.
147	I might go to Sharpstown and have a look, but that is not set in stone.
147	It depends on what type of time I have and what type of mood I'm in. You know we're supposed to wear our African attire on Sunday.
147	You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m.
147	I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.
147	I'm tired of going to the same places.
147	We need some variety.
147	Gregg needs to get some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings.
147	And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.
147	If we have to sing "In the Sanctuary" one more time, I'm going to throw up.
147	I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off.
147	It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.
147	See you later!!!!!
148	Sorry, it took so long to respond to the e-mail.
148	Hope, you guys are doing well!
148	Yes, I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees!
148	We really need to get something out pretty soon to the people.
148	Grandpa says people are calling, (I wonder if its just one or two people), but nevertheless, we still need to get something out.
148	Talk with you soon!
149	Hi Jeannie, Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time employment.
149	I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within the company.
149	I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a strong interest in part-time employment.
149	Please let me know if anything comes up, and also if we need to meet.
149	I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm interested in part-time employment.
149	I've casually mentioned this to him in the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.
149	Thanks for your help!
150	Thanks for the "words of encouragement".
150	I just sent an e-mail to my Human Resources Rep and will wait to get a response.
150	I am so READY!!.
150	I've set up a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again since I really have made up my mind.
150	Talk with you tonight!
151	Hi Jeanie, What is your schedule looking like for this week or next in the late afternoon?
152	Sorry, can't do it on Thursday, but what about Friday sometime?
153	Thanks for the schedule.
153	If the game with Seattle is still available on Thursday, April 5, I would love to use the seats.
153	Thanks for your help!!!
154	So nice to hear from you.
154	I miss not being able to see you and talk with you on a regular basis.
154	I hope the kids are dong fine.
154	Jordan went to children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor.
154	He just starts smiling when I mention her name.
154	That little mannish boy already likes girls, I think.
154	Anyway, things are going okay, I'm still leaning toward trying to find a part-time position next year.
154	This job is so very hard!
154	Take care!
155	Hey Sugar Bear!
155	I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay for you.
155	I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.
155	How's Erika doing?
155	You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron Burr) from the church.
155	You remember he was the one that used to sit on the front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.
155	You remember him, anyway they hauled his tail out of there.
155	It was terrible to see someone hauled from the church, not matter what the situation is.
155	Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!
156	Hi Marlo, This deal was done on Enron Online, so do we need to get further information from Enron Online?
156	Please let me know?
157	I'm sorry, I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m.
157	I thought I had responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay, but I checked my e-mails and discovered that I did not respond.
157	Anyway, my fault, what's good for you next week?
157	( I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back, instead of just putting it on my calendar.) Thanks
158	Hi Roni Charnella had asked that I send you information regarding scooters.
158	The outfit is called Scoot Around North America.
158	They have a web site at www.scootaround.com.
158	Their phone number is 1-888-441-7575.
158	Hope this works out for you.
158	Take Care!
159	Hey Bobbi, Here is a revised nomination sheet for March, and also, I know you'll be shocked, but I sent the contract to the lawyers for approval, so we should get it back shortly!
159	See ya
160	Test message, I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it, my e-mail is acting up, so before I re-type this, I want to see if you get this!
161	Hey Girl, Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.
161	I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.
161	I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.
161	By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!
161	See you!
162	No, I don't know her number.
162	but Anessa is , huh!
162	Just call up to the church and give them your count for dinner for the kids.
163	Yes, I'll ask her, but I also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally!
163	Do you know what song?
164	Daddy, I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.
164	I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for you guys.
164	Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from me, nobody else is (smile).
164	After all, I owe you one!!
164	Love Bernie!
165	That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.
165	If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.
165	I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.
165	I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late night.
165	See you later
166	Yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are "I Believe in You and Me" by Whitney Houston and "Kissing You" by Faith Evans
167	Hey Girl, Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he choir really enjoyed themselves.
167	Rickey Dillard is a fool!
167	He's alot of fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.
167	Everyone says he used to be gay, and not he's changed, but......
167	I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.
167	I haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking the question.
167	Did he do his radio program yesterday?
167	Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding, Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.
167	I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, instead of me, all I had was the reins, at first I said "the hell with this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.
167	Talk with you later!
168	I just called my other friend, her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 281-484-2380.
168	She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You, but said its a really sexy song, Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas.
168	She's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs.
168	Take care!
169	Yes, she'snot familiar with the music, but said she would listen to the music and see what she thought, but I have put in a call to my other friend, but I know she would do it if her schedule was open, but she does is professionally, and I know there would be a charge, I should hear something today from my other friend.
170	I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.
170	You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday.
170	She said Kathy Florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape!
170	It must have been awesome!
170	Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?
170	How are things going with Steve's party and have you set a time yet?
170	What does he want/need for his birthday?
170	I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, socks, etc.) Talk to ya!
171	Phillip.
171	The following four deals are the only ones that need to new mid for NBPL: The rest of that list is misleading, etc. etc. etc.!
172	Hey Nella, When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.
172	He said that everything was okay financially for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.
172	He sounded okay with me asking about it.
172	He even said "You are so sweet with words".
172	He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.
172	How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.
172	We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.
172	In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.
172	They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.
172	All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.
172	Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.
172	Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.
172	I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.
172	This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10 minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.
172	Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.
172	So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.
172	I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!) She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.
172	Talk with you later
173	Please sign me up.
174	Please sign me up.
175	Jesus, Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.
175	It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.
175	I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.
175	Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.
175	I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.
175	The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.
175	Thanks
176	Please let me know why my VAR is $2.2 million.
176	My position is 108.3 short, so I need to know why the VAR is so large .
176	Hunter would like an answer as soon as psossible.
176	Thanks
177	What's Happening?
177	How's it going?
177	I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.
177	I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.
177	Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.
177	This daylight savings time is nice.
177	It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.
177	Did you find any houses that you liked?
177	How long were you out?
177	Talk with you later!
178	Val, What is this e-mail about, did you mean to send it to me?
178	Send me some of those funny jokes that are going around.
178	Talk to ya later!
179	Bobbi, Here is the final for March, 2001, I'm preparing the April, 2001 sheet as well!
180	Well, hell, I forgot the attachment!
180	Here it is........
181	My id is pmims
182	Well, hell, I forgot the attachment!
182	Here it is........
183	My id is pmims
184	I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management Deal.
184	Please review and let me know what you think!
185	Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.
185	I know you're very busy.
185	Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll hail a cab over to Mom's house.
185	Everything here is going okay.
185	I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.
185	I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.
185	As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc. Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.
185	Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.
185	See ya!
186	Hey Lizzie Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus $0.01.
186	I have revised both tickets.
186	Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla.
187	Yes, We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning, we'll be back on Monday.
187	Take care and Happy Easter!
188	I certainly will, I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!!!
189	Hey Robert,, Sorry I was out on vacation, and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his headhunter, but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week.
189	Take care!
190	Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.
190	That is awful, such young people.
190	I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.
190	If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.
190	If you need help with the kids or anything.
190	Also, sorry about the choir, what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.
190	Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter.
190	That's a shame!
190	You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.
190	That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.
190	You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
190	We need to shop together more often.
190	Yes, I will be at choir tonight.
190	See you then!
191	No---thank you.
192	Hey what's Happening?
192	Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!
192	We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater, should be very good!
192	Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.
192	I'm assuming her last name is Brown.
192	Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).
192	Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.
192	She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.
192	They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.
192	I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.
192	I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.
192	I just hope he thinks she's cute.
192	Oh well, talk to you later.
193	I just spoke with Sharon Mahon and she asked me to tell you hello.
193	Did you know that she was expecting a baby girl in August?
193	She's five months pregnant and getting married on this Sunday to Tyrone.
193	Can you believe it?
193	She seem's happy.
193	Did Barbara ever talk with my friend about singing at the wedding?
193	What did she decide?
193	Talk with you later!
194	Good afternoon, Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impression was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.
194	I called Horace this morning and asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him out on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't lie).
194	He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.
194	Robin said he was just crying while he was talking.
194	He said he's in "time out" now.
194	I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept talking.
194	He said he's really having family problems surrounding this church thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.
194	He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting with the deacons.
194	I asked him what is going on with the deacons, and he said it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his office.
194	I let him go after that.
194	Now isn't all of that interesting.
194	I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.
194	She married Tyrone this past Sunday.
194	That revival is this week isn't it?
194	Talk with you later!
195	Hey girl, Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.
195	So little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to say!).
195	Is he cute?
195	I can't wait to see him.
195	Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.
195	I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.
195	Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.
195	He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.
195	I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.
195	That was hilarious.
195	Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.
195	I cracked up.
195	The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".
195	However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.
195	I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.
195	The Hilton Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.
195	Tell me that dates again.
195	Talk with you later.
196	Our Michcon and Consumers Guy is iyt having a baby, so here's what he left me for Michcon and zero for Consumers.
197	Lizzie, what is the difference between the two prices [Mark Hall]
198	Hi Darla, I've put in a call to Nicor.
198	The objective was to pay them $0.01 for the swap between Peoples and Nicor.
198	Thw other ticket involved is 664363.
198	If I'm not mistaken, I think we have accomplished that.
198	I'll let you know.
199	Please call so we can discuss!
200	Darla, I spoke with Michelle at Nicor and I believe that everything is correct.
200	I corrected the tickets back on April 12, 2001.
200	Please let me know if this issue is settled or if we need to do more.
200	Thanks
201	okay, how many people are you all expecting?
202	Kenny, is there a fee for reserving Tom Bass Park?
202	If so, how much and are we going to split the cost?
202	I believe that I will have approximately 15 guests..
202	Tasha & her family----4 people ( 2 kids) Hope & family --- 4 people (1 child) Me and My family -- 4 people (2 kids) Ora & family --- 3 people ( no kids) Angie - possible 3 to 4 people (possible 2 kids) Todd's friends from Dynegy - (2 adults)

204	Hello!
204	How are things going?
204	I'm pretty tired this morning, I went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 8p.m.
204	and did not leave until 11:30p.m.--pretty exhausting, but Todd is out of town today and I wanted to squeeze that in before he left and I'd have to get a sitter.
204	Anyway, is everthing going well with the house?
204	Hope so.....My daycare notified us yesterday morning when Todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on June 1st.
204	Talk about not getting much notice.
204	Anyway, needless to say, that is my new crusade!
204	Talk with you later!
205	Hi Scott, I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.
205	Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.
205	I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.
205	Thanks
206	would it be possible to leave it on ENA paper, it seems that would be the easiest
207	Test
208	Dan Hyvl went back to the original trader and wants to double-check, but it seems pretty likely that everything needs to be done under Crestar.
208	Hold tight!
209	Hey you go ladies
210	i'd be delighted!
211	yes
212	Yes, your correct, I'm sure that we are going to have the same issue.
212	I'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me.
212	I know he had to contact the Calgary trader to get a resolution.
212	I'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says.
212	Thanks for reminding me again!
213	Here is my best attempt at month-to-date volumes, holler if you strongly disagree!
214	Hi, I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.
214	We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.
214	I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.
214	I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.
214	I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.
214	I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.
214	I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.
214	She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.
214	I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing, he is not ready yet.
214	but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.
214	I just hope he understands.
214	I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.
214	I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.
214	It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.
214	The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.
214	He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.
214	Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.
214	If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.
214	Talk with you later!
215	Hi Lizzie, Will you please call this lady at TransCanada, Tracy in Gas Accounting at 402-505-8800.
215	She says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect TransCanada counterparty.
215	They are not deals in my region, so I thought it best to have you handle, as opposed to passing her around..
215	Thanks
216	That's fine, but I think I got off kinda cheap, so let me know if I need to contribute more!
216	It was so much fun!
217	Dear Dan, This e-mail shall confirm the sale of natural gas to National Steel from Enron North America: Date: May 25, 2001 Price: $4.22 Delivery Point: Nipsco
218	Hi Liz, Thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline.
218	This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information.
218	Also could you please add Lisa Kinsey and Mark Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas.
218	One last request, could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations.
218	Thanks again.
219	I called you back at 10:31, i'll try again in about 15/20 minutes.
219	You should carry your cell phone in your purse in case you need to call me.
219	Then you van hang up and I'll call you right back!
220	I just found out we have a toll free number 1-800 97ENRON, they tell me you have to select the Enron Bldg and my extension is 5772!
221	No, I didn't make the party.
221	I just kind of fizzled out!
221	Anyway, hope you're feeling better and hope we can roll today so we can catch up chile!
221	I'll call before I leave.
222	Yes, I thought we had sent you the contract already.
222	The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates, and not specifically Peoples or Nicor, if I'm not mistaken.
222	Is this going to be a problem?
222	I'm sorry, I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!!!
223	So sorry everyone, I inadvertently sent you prices from the May 1, 2001 model.
223	Thanks for your patience!!!
224	Please prepare a wire transfer to Crestar in the amount of $873,572 for the above referenced time period.
224	This wire transfer should be made effective June 1, 2001.
224	Thank you for your help!
225	Hi Lizzie, Will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st.
225	The sitara ticket Number is 761773.
225	I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on (a good deal for Enron), so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period.
225	So as a result, to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations, would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations?
225	If not, no big deal, it would just make less work for everyone concerned.
225	Thanks
226	Hey Jimbo, I will be on vacation that entire week.
226	Sorry!
226	It's so funny, I never take vacation and the one week that I do, that's when I'll be gone.
226	Anyway, you can have my space!
227	Hello, Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.
227	Was is just Fantastic!
227	(smile).
227	Any brotha's and sistah's over there?
227	Hope you had a great time.
227	I would love to see pictures sometime.
227	I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.
227	I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.
227	It has the gold cap to it.
227	Also, I would like some black eyeliner.
227	Just call me whenever you have it.
227	Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.
227	Just let me know when you have it.
227	Thanks!
228	Guess what, i will be on vacation starting next monday for a week.
228	Maybe we can hook up this weekend?
229	Stephen, You are THE BEST!!!!!!!!
229	One hundred thanks!!!!!
230	Hey Rob, We have one more comment for you to consider: We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on this guaranty".
230	We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.
230	How about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.
230	Our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days.
230	Your turn!
231	Girl, This is a Geoff Storey deal, I'll work on it after trading.
231	Thanks
232	Hi Glen, In an effort to expedite the execution of the parental guarantee for Cilcorp, would you please consider reviewing and utilizing Enron's form of guarantee.
232	I have attached a copy of the gurantee for your consideration.
232	Please call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.
232	Thanks
233	Hey good morning, How did things go last night?
233	I hope everything went well.
233	I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.
233	What is Hope's phone number.
233	I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it better not make me look fatter!).
233	Write back when you have a chance.
234	I'll probably be there at around 7:15 or earlier if I need to, what do you think about that time?
235	Hey lady, Does the below referenced language work for you?
235	Let me know.
235	Thanks
236	Hope, Hope, Hope, The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!
236	But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!
236	Is that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?
236	How much is the dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.
236	(p.s. I'm not worried about the cost, I just want to look good!) What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled.
236	That'll be so cute!
236	I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him.
236	I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as well.
236	That boy is a mess!
236	Talk to you soon!
236	P.S.
236	Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!
237	Hi Stuart, Please remove me from your mailing list.
237	Thanks
238	Girl, that's extremely reasonable!
238	I'll order mine early, where are we purchasing them from?
238	P.S.
238	Please send "Tarsha" a picture of my dress.
238	I think I accidentally deleted the picture of my dress, doggonit!
238	(You know I need to brush p on my e-mail skills.....they laugh at me all the time.)
239	Hey Rob, Last time, one more change, if you will?
240	Hey Lizzie, That deal should have been booked to Nine Energy Services, LLC.
240	Can you please change that in Sitara.....thanks!
241	Hi Vonda, Here are the October offers for your consideration.
241	Thanks
242	Hi Vonda Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece.
242	If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.
242	Enron offers the following: Period: November, 2001 - March, 2002 Region: Trunkline South Texas Pool Demand Charge: $0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.

245	I'm excited!
245	How do you feel about it, how did Robin feel?
245	I know we'll be jamming!.
245	I just hope we don't have to sing too many V. Michael McKay originals alllllllllll the time!
246	So sorry about that.....We do not have a date for you b/c the contract does not exist as of yet.
246	Legal said that we could just end that sentence right after the word "transactions".
246	take out the language that says "including without limitation the Enfolio....... Once you make that deletion, how long do you think it will take to have it executed and a copy faxed to me at 713-646-3390? Thanks, we're almost there!!!!!!
247	Thanks so much.
248	Hi John, Once again, so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.
248	We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.
248	I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.
248	Please call if you have further questions.
248	Thanks
249	I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!
249	(you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!
249	Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!
249	We've got much greater concerns right now!
249	Love ya!
249	P.S.
249	I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available.
250	Tony, Per our conversation!
251	Good morning Rob, Thanks so much, it's been a pleasure working with you.
251	Once the document is executed, will you please have someone fax me a copy at 713-646-3390 (also have someone call me to let me know its on its way).
251	Thanks again.
252	Hi Dave, I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m. My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the 5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".
252	He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.
252	I'll keep pushing!
252	Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.
252	Thanks Patrice
253	Hey Guys, I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.
253	We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.
253	If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?
253	Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?
253	Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?
253	Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?
253	While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.
253	Will you please let me know how we should proceed.
253	I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.
253	Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.
253	Thank you for your cooperation.
254	John, are your responsibilities concerning Heartland Steel fulfulled if the contract is terminated?
255	Thanks, I love this e-mail!
256	Hey Debra, Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following: They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.
256	From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.
256	Thanks
257	I'm gathering the base contract as we speak, I'll get it to you asap!
257	Thanks
258	Hey girl, I'll be out of the office all next week, traveling and meeting with customers in Chicago.
258	Call me if you have any questions regarding Kaztex (or anything else) we have worked together on.
258	My cell phone is 713-851-6240.
258	If i'm not there, please leave me a message.
258	Thanks for all your hard work!
259	Hey Rob, I haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract?
259	Is everything okay?
259	I'll be out of the office traveling next week, and I wanted to get a status before I left.
259	Thanks
260	Spoke too soon....it's here!
261	Spoke too soon!---It's here!
261	Thanks
262	Hey Jason, I understand that you were out of the office on Friday, and I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will call you on Monday mid-morning.
262	The customer has called again on Friday, and I would like to get this thing resolved.
262	Please work with me on this issue.
262	I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore, but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately.
262	My cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime.
262	I'll be visiting customers, but please call and leave a message if I'm not available.
262	Thanks
263	John, Since Heartland Steel was sold in July, 2001, are you still involved in this deal?
263	Thanks Patrice
264	Get out of here!!!!
264	Is this an Enron company?
264	If so, I am so happy for you Lizzie, I will certainly miss you.
264	You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable!
264	(just like "old shoes") .
264	I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job!
265	Hey Lizzie, what is her address, I forgot, I need to send her a business card .
266	Hi Guys, Attached please find Enron's offer for additional supply for the November, 2001-March, 2002 period.
266	Please call me with any questions you may have at 713-272-9825.

267	Thanks
268	Thanks so much!
268	What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron?
269	Hey girl, I'm trying to print this document....is this something you scanned?
269	Why don't you fax it to me real quick and I'll sign immediately!
270	no i have not received yet, what time did you send?
271	Did you know......The Royster Clark Nitrogen facility was originally built and constructed by Nicor Gas Company in an effort to stabilize pressure at the East Dubuque location of their system.
271	Royster Clark is currently listed as the largest industrial consumer of natural gas in Illinois, burning 30,000 MMBtu/d.
271	Quote of the Day: There is no "I" in TEAMWORK.
272	Hi Bob, Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.
272	Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.
272	I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).
272	As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.
272	Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).
272	I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.
272	P.S.
272	Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?
272	If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.
272	I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.
272	Please reply when you have a moment.
272	Thanks
273	Hey girl, I don't know what in the heck I was talking about, Nicor Enerchange did send me the correct version.
273	Please review and let me know what you have for them.
273	Thanks, Patrice
274	Update: I spoke with Jeff Hodge and was able to obtain a Bill of Sale document from CSN.
274	Jeff is currently reviewing this document and will let me know how to proceed.
274	I'll let you know more when I hear back from Jeff.
275	Thank you!
276	Hi Pat, Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements: At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.
276	I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.
276	The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following: 1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?
276	2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?
276	Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.
276	I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.
276	Talk to you then.
276	P.S.
276	As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.
276	Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.
277	Hi Bob, Per our conversation this a.m., here are the notional sales prices for Nicor City Gate deliveries for the following: Five Year Price out of January, 2004 = $3.67 estimate Ten Year Price out of January, 2004 = $.3.92 estimate (Please keep in mind that these are ESTIMATES!!) If you need these prices further broken out by year, please call me.
277	I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week.
277	Thanks Patrice P.S.
277	You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under, is it Corn Products International?
277	Write back, because I need this information for the contracts, etc.
278	Hi Dave, Attached, please find Enron's offer for Trunkline East Louisiana volumes for the winter months ending in 2002 and 2003.
278	Please feel free to call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.
278	Thank you
279	Hey girl, What's going on?
279	It is truly a slow day over here.
279	So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.
279	Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law.
279	She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.
279	It was nice, but long.
279	The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.
279	The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45.
279	I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.
279	But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night.
279	I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire.
279	After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.
279	The top that I bought set it off so nicely.
279	It was black, light brown and gold!
279	I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot.
279	Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
279	When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty. Made my evening. Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word. But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly. He was pissed! Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there. How did your evening go last night? We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight. Todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart. I said fine, have fun. I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too. Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much. All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities. Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment. Oh well, talk with you later! Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!
280	Girl, what is PMO?
280	I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit the send button and there you are!
280	Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations?
280	I certainly hope so.
280	I know planning a wedding is alot of work.
280	Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor.
280	I had a good time with my boys this weekend.
280	They are crazy.
280	We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.
280	After that, we went to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.
280	What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.
280	Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.
280	$65 a pair for the kind that I liked.
280	But since I was there, I said, what the heck?
280	After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).
280	I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.
280	We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.
280	Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.
280	How was your weekend?
280	See ya!
281	Hi Pat, I spoke with our attorney this afternoon, and he is in the process of contacting your attorney.
281	It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron, did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into.
281	Long story, short, our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision.
281	Thanks
282	Girl, that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned.
282	I have no idea, all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work.
282	I really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am.
282	I love the "hood" aspect of the neighborhood, I love the "colored" folks, and so on.
282	I need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for.
282	All I know, is that I'm not getting any younger, and why not enjoy a new house now, what am I waiting for?
282	Girl, I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well, but it has to be done!
282	Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m. When I answered the phone, I recognized her voice immediately, and I got scared that something had happened.
282	That heifer called to tell me that Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft drink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck Fruitopia meant) and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true, because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one, that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question.
282	You are the adult here, not Jordan!
282	She also said Jordan kind of smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this.
282	ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!
282	Now on the other hand, Jordan will have to be punished for lying, but my goodness, can you believe it?
283	Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class: The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant) Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies, CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.
283	The fuel is 2.67% Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect Lebanon - often constrained Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7

287	Hey Sister Sims, You were really singing those hymns last night!
287	How long did choir rehearsal last?
287	I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.
287	I do need to look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......
287	How is Siera doing in school these days?
287	I hope everything is going well for her.
287	I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan and see what's going on over there.
287	His teacher is really very immature.
287	She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.
287	You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk.
287	Write back
288	I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.
288	I'm going to look up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go together.
288	I'll let you know what I find out.
289	Hey Pat, I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).
289	Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).
289	The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).
289	This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.
289	You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.
289	Per the contract, Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.
289	I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.
289	Let's talk!

290	Hi Lisa, Will you please add Petro-Canada Oil and Gas to the list of counterparties for Mid-Market.
290	Thanks
291	Melba, On location #1--I want the name to be NGPL/MANHATTEN--is this too many characters?
292	yes
293	Please see attached.
294	Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?
294	It is the Westin.
294	Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?
294	As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).
294	Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.
294	Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.
294	I'll be in the office until around 10:30.
294	Thanks
295	Please call me when you arrive.
295	Thanks
296	Hi Gene, As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.
296	These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.
296	These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.
296	Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.
296	If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".
296	I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.
296	Please call me at 713-853-5772 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts.
296	Thanks
297	Hey Debra, Here are the changes back from Cilco.
297	I have no problems with the changes, let me know what you think.
297	P.S.

298	These changes, in addition, to the others are fine.
298	Thanks for your help!!
299	You are sooooooo crazy!!!!
299	I'll call you after trading!
300	Hi Jan, So nice to hear from you.
300	I am glad you are finally "enjoying life".
300	I wish I could join you now.
300	With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).
300	Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".
300	I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.
300	The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.
300	I really like what I'm doing.
300	My boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.
300	Jordan is doing pretty good in school, I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.
300	Kendall, what can I say?
300	My Kendall is something else.
300	He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!
300	Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.
300	Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.
300	I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.
300	Anyway, take care Love ya!
301	Come again, what you talking about?
302	Thank you dah-ling!
303	They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.
303	As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.
303	I'll ask them to send us a draft.
303	Call me when you get a chance.
303	thanks

347	Hi Debra, Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".
347	Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.
347	I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.
347	I will be on vacation Tuesday and Wednesday,so I would appreicate your help.
347	As always, tomorrow I can be reached on my cell if you need me.
347	Thanks P.S.
347	Did you get ahold of Mr. Hunt from Nicor yet.
348	Hi Pat, As we discussed the pricing for December, 2001 will be as follows (all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX): For Enron to perform full balancing, this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d.....
348	the price will be an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December, 2001 For Enron to perform the service, just as we are currently doing for November, 2001, whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity (you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d.
348	As I stated above, all the prices listed above are estimates.
348	As of this date, Enron will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals.
348	Please call so that we may discuss.
348	Thanks P.S.
348	The burns are as follows: Date MMBtu/d
349	You are so nasty!!!!!!!
349	Who is Henry (that get's on your nerves)?

349	When God put us together, he knew what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!

357	We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.
357	I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.

359	How are the proceedings coming along?
359	Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.
359	The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.
359	Thank God that did not happen.
359	I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do, I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.
359	Got any ideas?
359	By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?
359	Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.
359	I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.
359	We are some reading fools these days.
359	Write back!!!!
360	You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers.

360	If you are feeling apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that you have, so that you don't waste your visit by being overcome by emotions.
360	Call me when you get back from your visit.

360	Call me on my cell.
360	Love ya!
361	Hey, how are you, Yes, I'm still here, I'm doing well.
361	2001 was not a pleasant year for alot of people, and it was certainly no exception for me.
361	Along with my favorite company going bankrupt, my father passed after a lennghty illness.
361	But all is well for the time being.
361	Nice to hear from you.
361	Tell everyone I said hello.
361	Thanks for thinking of me!
362	Hey Tom, Not as of yet, but it sounds like maybe shortly.
362	Talk to you later.
363	Hey Pooky, The rest of the weekend was fine.
363	I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.
363	In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.
363	Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.
363	So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.
363	We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.
363	It was awful.
363	I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.
363	Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.
363	I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.
363	The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.
363	So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.
363	I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.
363	I know what you mean about your Dad.
363	In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....
363	Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.....
364	Hey "G", what's up?
364	I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there!
364	How's it going this morning?
364	I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.
364	It's on options and volatility.
364	Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me, I find the class a real challenge.
364	I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
364	Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff.
364	Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.
364	It's painful for me....whew!
364	Talk with you later.......how many days left now?
364	Love ya
365	Got it, let's talk tonight.
365	What time is good to call you?
365	or you give me a call!
366	Yes, you may us me...are you going to have trouble getting home?
366	How much snow is on the ground now?
367	yes, yes, yes, looking forward to it!
368	I did not realize there was a problem.
368	Pretty bad out there huh?
368	You really need to get a cell phone for bad weather, you could have been stranded.!
368	Glad you're there!
369	Hey Jimbo, Good morning, Will you please send me your address and fax number, we're going to try and get some contracts sent our sometime real soon.

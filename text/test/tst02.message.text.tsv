5	Congrats to you too.
5	Hope to see you out again soon...Thanks again for your help with Coal info.
5	Fletch
6	I appreciate it!
6	Hope all is well with you...we're doing fine now that the flu made its way through our house.
6	Fletch
7	We're still working on it for you!
7	I'll keep you updated as I know more.

8	Sally, Congratulations on your promotion!
8	Good luck with everything.

9	Patti, What do I do with this now?
9	How do I get the $50?
9	Can I wait and get a series of months reimbursed later or do I have to go through this every month?

10	Louise, I mentioned an idea to Jeff Shankman the other day about providing some charting and other types of tools to EOL users and he asked me to get with you.
10	He said you were already working on some additions to the website.
10	I would really like to participate in the development of these tools, so please let me know when I can get with you and discuss my ideas.
10	Thanks, Fletch Sturm
11	Louise, Yes, I'd like to get together as soon as possible.
11	I'm available this afternoon (Fri) or Tues.
11	next week in the afternoon.
11	Let me know.
11	Fletch
12	yes, that's fine Fletch
13	Jeff, Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have time(?).
13	I just wanted to brief you first.
13	I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings.
13	This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind.
13	Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in basis until 8:30?
13	I think it would be worth it.
13	I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's basis positions.
13	Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions?
13	Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions?
13	I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being "cluttered up" in different books (i.e. the P/L from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders.) Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?
13	It seems like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.
13	Talk to you soon, Fletch
14	I'll need to go another time...already have a meeting.
14	I definitely want to see the demo.
14	Fletch
15	Hey, Sorry I haven't read my e-mail in the past day and a half (too busy selling), but that sounds good.
15	Fletch
16	ok, cool Fletch
17	Sorry, I have a meeting today, then going out of town for the rest of the week.
17	I'll have to do it next week.
18	Bob, My one pass number is YY109954.
18	Thanks for the tip!
18	Fletch
19	that won't be a problem at all fletch
20	Kevin, Don't forget about us down here in the dusty old gas trading business!
20	Congratulations, Fletch
21	could you re-send to everyone and ask them to bring a copy of their one-month and summer basis positions?
21	thanks, fletch
22	thanks Coi Fletch
23	Congratulations Dave!
23	You're the king!
23	Fletch
24	Greg, I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.
24	I've used this to build a real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc. I think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether it is in Excel format or some homemade format.
24	For example, Hunter and I were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR.
24	We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc. If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors.
24	Let me know what you think!
24	Fletch
25	Sorry, just read this e-mail and don't think I did the trade you are referring to.
25	Let me know.
25	Fletch
26	Greg, Check out a company called Opus 360 for recruiting IT people (www.opus360.com).
26	It might be a good investment for the equity group too (OPUS).
26	Fletch
27	Please put this on my calander for Wed (5/3) at 3:30 in 30C1.
27	Thanks, Fletch
28	thanks for the note!
28	we're doing fine and trying to get some sleep here and there...i'll e-mail pic's to you...take care.
28	fletch
29	we're ok for now...thanks for checking fletch
30	Douglas, Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty of swap transactions.
30	Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.
30	Thanks again, Fletcher Sturm
31	NatGas is going to the moon on Monday!
32	Melba, The description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing...How about the following: Floating price A: Gas Daily midpoint for Henry Hub Floating price B: Gas Daily midpoint for __________ Buyer pays Floating price A plus applicable basis, seller pays Floating price B We should substitute your long description for "Gas Daily midpoint" above.
32	Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products.
32	Fletch Sturm
33	Sheri, Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.
33	I'd like to have her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the website.
33	I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't know about the others.
33	In addition, her trades (stack manager customer trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).
33	If you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.
33	Thanks, Fletcher Sturm
34	Scott, I'm receiving faxes from you guys everyday, and would just like to be taken off the global e-mail distribution.
34	Thanks, Fletch Sturm Enron
35	anytime after 4:30pm is fine...I am at EB-3233C Fletch
36	Rain, I'd like to coordinate this with the other fellas (Hunter, Scott, etc.) Let's see if we can all go to the same one!
36	Fletch
37	Rain, Please put this on my calendar.
37	Thanks, Fletch
38	Scott, Please take me off the global e-mail list...
38	Thanks,
39	yes, that would be fine.
39	fletch
40	sorry so late Fletch
41	Rain, Please sign me up for the class on Fri.
41	(8/11).
41	Thanks, Fletch
42	Melba, I'm sorry I haven't replied sooner, but there is a decision to be made about what type of product these should fall under...Gas Daily, or Basis.
42	We're afraid that if we categorize them as Gas Daily, then anyone who logs onto the site looking for basis would miss these products altogether.
42	The "US GAS DAILY HeHub - CHIC" is cleary the best description for the website.
42	I'll get back to you as soon as we make a decision.
42	Fletch
43	Please put this on my calendar if you haven't already.
43	fletch
44	Sorry, but I've been out of town since you sent this.
44	There have been a couple of errors pointed out to me since the publishing, most of which have apparently been somewhat obvious (i.e. not difficult to figure out).
44	I'll look into this one and get back to you.
44	Fletcher Sturm p.s.
44	Thanks for your support!
45	If you haven't received the details yet, here they are (Enron sells): If you need anything else, Fletch
46	Under the alternative "bumping" method, if the market is 3.75/5.25 and our EOL and ICE market's are both 4/5 in that case, would we pay brokerage if someone executes on ICE rather than EOL?
46	Fletch
47	Dale, I agree with your proposed changes fletch
48	Dale, The product that crosses monthly and daily swaps is the IF vs GD index swap that we currently offer.
48	I'll call you later...no time right now to write more.
48	Fletch
49	The following is a list of daily basis product names that we would like to create, all of which are US GAS BASIS deal type: GD/D TecoP-HHub (short for Teco Pool) I have put a call in to Mark Taylor regarding new product descriptions, but have yet to hear back from him.
49	Fletch
50	one more change...NL1 change to NXL1
51	also, if "NL1" appears anywhere else, change it to NXL1 thanks fletch
52	these looks good to me except for the lower case "h" in the Hub phys that we already talked about.
52	fletch
53	John, The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to Sitara and Tagg.
53	I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells me they should be ready tomorrow.
53	Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.
53	For now, we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.
53	Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format: The only product that will be different is the Nymex to daily swap which will be: Any questions or comments, Fletch
54	Brad, (see message below from Melba) Which one should we use, and how should it look on the website?
54	Remember, only five characters will fit in the name.
54	Maybe just CNGNo?
54	Let me know and i'll forward to Melba.
54	Fletch
55	Melba, Could you see to this please?
55	Thanks, Fletch
56	Here is the list for you to keep: Duke John Thomas (713) 260-8569 El Paso Bo Collins (713) 420-3466 Fletch

57	Fletch
58	Eric, The name I have at El Paso is Tim Bourne 713-420-3826.
58	Todd Geiger is my contact over there.
58	He's a Vice President and told me that Tim runs the trading group and would not be in the office until Mon.
58	next week.
58	Fletch
59	Eric, This guy is a friend of mine and he said he'll put in some good words about EOL and especially the new product that we're going to launch.
59	His name is Chris McDonald at Southern (678) 579-3298.
59	He runs the West gas trading at Southern.
59	Fletch
60	Yes, the plan is to roll the new products out on Fri., the 22nd.
60	fletch
61	good morning!
61	just wondering if you've talked to Gas Daily yet and if you need anything more from me...also, i'd like to see what you're going to give to them (G.D.) with regard to facts about the products, EOL, etc...
61	we'd like to launch the products on Fri and have the article appear on Mon because the audience should be bigger than Fri.
61	fletch
62	David, Yes, i'm interested in meeting with these guys, but i'm unavailable until Thu or Fri.
62	Let me know if I can sit in on a meeting.
62	Thanks, Fletch Sturm
63	Eric, I've been out of the office for two days, but just received this message and it's great.
63	Let me know what else I can do!
63	Fletch
64	Please put this on my schedule.
64	thanks, fletch
65	Eric, The products have been launched (Mon) and did trade a couple times.
65	As far as another article in GD, i'll check with John, but I think it's a good idea.
65	Fletch
66	good luck...I'm sure you'll do well!
66	Have fun fletch
67	Right shoulder complete...full reversal mode as of right now...bang!
67	Fletch

70	thanks, fletch
71	Terri, Hi!
71	Thanks for your interest in my book.
71	You should be able to get one at www.amazon.com the fastest.
71	If they're out, or say it will take a while, go directly to www.pennwell.com (this is the publisher.) Again, thanks.
71	Fletch Sturm
72	I'm in for dinner tonight for sure and golf Sun a.m. if you're able.
72	Oh EOG...how I love thee!
72	+2 1/4 Fletch
73	Janelle, That's a great product with a simple explanation.
73	I have blank deal tickets ready to be filled in!
73	Good luck.
73	Fletch
74	Ted, I'll be out of town this weekend (Oct 27/28), but you can put me down for the s/s on Nov 4.
74	Please send details.
74	Fletch Sturm
75	thanks for the follow-up, fletch
76	Please put this on my calendar.
76	Thanks, Fletch
77	We'll need another room.
77	These meetings are only for the MidWest traders.
77	The meeting with the guy from PJM is for the northeast group.
77	Thanks, Fletch
78	Dave, John Lavorato would like me to get back with him regarding exactly why we can't send out a pop-up window to advertise the new power products that we're launching this week.
78	Could you call or e-mail back?
78	He basically said he wants to do one, but I don't want to if it could crash all of EOL on our behalf.
78	Let me know.
78	Thanks, Fletch
79	please put this on my calendar.
79	thanks, fletch
80	Thank you very much for doing that for me!
80	Fletch
81	Jenny, It looks like I need to read my e-mail more often.
81	I'll start using it tomorrow (Mon).
81	Fletch
82	yes, that will work.
82	thanks fletch
83	At your convenience (not necessarily today), could you provide my wife with the addresses for the following people, please?
83	Her e-mail is sturmt@yahoo.com.
83	Thanks, Fletch John Lavorato Dave Delainey Kevin Presto yourself Rogers Herndon Dana Davis Rob Benson Jeff King Larry Valderama Larry Jester Matt Lorenz names below are NatGas people Scott Neal John Arnold Phillip Allen Mike Grigsby Jeff Shankman thanks again!
84	that's not our house for sale yet, but probably in the next 6 months or so...not in a hurry as it feels like real estate market cooling off somewhat.
84	thanks.
84	Fletch
85	Marc, Sorry, we don't have anything open right now.
85	Possibly in 6 months or so.
85	Fletch
86	Jeff, With little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation constraints, etc., it's going to be difficult for me to say, geographically, where I think the boundaries ought to be.
86	However, I think the market would always prefer a simple layout, something like MISO - West, - Central, - East, - South.
86	To me, I think that would cover the basic areas that trade differently in terms of price.
86	Fletch
87	Terri, Do you think we're close enough to book the deals.
87	Rogers and I keep forgetting that they're not in our positions everyday.
87	Fletch
88	jenny, i'd really like to be able to set my curves through Dec '03 without having to freak with that g.d.
88	contango weighting table in the MW4 file.
88	the market changes so fast during the day that i don't have time to switch between my MWSum and MW4 files fast enough to keep up with it.
88	i have a section in the MWSum spreadsheet where i keep all of the quick calcs on the calendars, so i could link that to the MW4 file like i'm doing through Oct '02.
88	come by tomorrow (Fri) and i'll show you what the h i'm talking about.
88	fletch
89	yes
90	Lloyd will
91	sorry, just got your e-mail...I actually don't have any in hand anyway.
91	thanks for your interest.
91	fletch sturm
92	Please put this on my calendar and remind me beforehand if you would.
92	Thanks, Fletch
93	Please put this on my calendar.
93	Thanks, Fletch
94	I'm pretty sure we're good to go.
94	Check back with you on the restaurant.
94	Fletch
95	Jeff, Thanks for inviting me to be in the Round Table.
95	I think it'll be a success.
95	I'm able to make it to dinner tomorrow night for the Tiger Team deal.
95	Fletch p.s.
95	did you close on your house yet?
96	no way just kidding...you get 'em...just tell TJ to put any vacation days you want to schedule on my calendar.
96	thanks fletch
97	great man...we just lifted a new pad too this past weekend...Bunker Hill fletch
98	yea...probably get a little relief from the inspection report though
99	Jenny, Thanks for the response.
99	I was under the impression that what you and I had worked out was more of a temporary fix and that there was another group working on a perrmanent solution for all of us.
99	I'm still obviously trading options, but would like you or JP or someone else in risk run a standard report for me each morning which shows my net delta positions by month and the subsequent gamma positions for certain $ moves in the underlying.
99	I could have Peter do it at night if it needs to be done before calc.
99	Just let me know.
99	Thanks, Fletch p.s.
99	sorry if it seems like this is being blown out of proportion
100	what does this mean?
100	Fletch
101	how about 3:15 or 3:30?
101	fletch
102	Please put on my calendar for every Tues., thanks.
102	Also, please notify my team that we will have a meeting with the marketing group every Mon at 3:30pm that Ed Baughman should be setting up with you.
102	That should be a weekly thing too.
102	Fletch
103	Attached is the form I'd like everyone to use for tomorrow's reports.
103	We will probably modify this and the ones to follow, so be prepared!
103	Fletch
104	you're cool
105	I'm not sure, but I think it's a data file for the charting software that I use.
105	Thanks, Fletch Sturm
106	please check Jeff King's VAR...it dosn't look right fletch sturm
107	just checking to see if you had any interest?
107	fletch
108	Ted, Please put her on the list of candidates for the next beginning rotation for Trader Track.
108	Thanks, Fletch
109	Caroline, Sorry I haven't checked my e-mail in a while, but that's trading...I'm more interested in Cinergy, but would like to see a deal done no matter where.
109	Let me know if I can help.
109	Fletch
110	Frank, This guy called me because he read the book I wrote about Natural Gas.
110	He has some kind of special treatment with the federal government in terms of gas purchases.
110	Sounds like a minority owned business to me.
110	Could you call him or refer him to someone at EES?
110	Thanks, Fletch Sturm Don Cooper
111	i'll be available fletch
112	ok, just send them to TJ when you can and ask her to put them on my calendar.
112	thanks, fletch
113	Please put this on my calendar, thanks fletch
114	Ted, Please mark me down for the dinner on Apr 10 Fletch
115	yes, I would be interested fletch
116	I would like to park in the new parking garage.
116	Please put me down for a "yes" to participate.
116	Fletcher J. Sturm
117	yeah man, it's going great...how are things with you?
117	fletch
118	Scott, Please take me off the e-mail distribution list...I receive the charts, etc. from others here.
118	Thanks, Fletch Sturm Enron
119	Phil, I don't have any specific recommendations, but I think PennWell Books has the best selection of all books on the subject.
119	Thanks for your interest, Fletch Sturm
120	John, Per Kevin, we've already sent our requests.
120	Fletch
121	John, Per Kevin, we've already sent our requests.
121	Fletch
122	Ron, I'm available today from 3:30 to 4:00 or 4:30 to 5:00 tomorrow if either of those works for you.
122	Fletch
123	sounds great to me.
123	fletch
124	I clicked on the link below and it didn't work...I'm RSVP'ing that I'll be there.
124	Fletch p.s.
124	who did the trade?
124	(customer/ENE market maker)
125	let's play ball!
125	fletch
126	thanks!
126	fletch
127	I met this guy the other day in my neighborhood.
127	He's the son-in-law of the people who live at the end of my street.
127	He seems like a good guy in person and looks like he's been close to trading.
127	He's local, so I thought it might not be a bad idea to bring him in. What do you think?
127	Fletch
128	I have decided that I would like this product to be set up the other way around where it is quoted as ComEd vs Cin.
128	I realize that it will show up as a negative spread, but I have other basis (spread) locations in mind that trade over Cinergy and can see how it will be confusing to some people in the industry.
128	Fletch (3-9684)
129	Thanks dude...it's all bearish right now as the price is headed lower.
129	Did you see the WSJ from this morning?
129	Check out the summary article on Beige Book.
129	fletch
130	Jeff, Thanks for the referral.
130	My book should still be available on amazon.com, barnes&nobel.com, and at pennwell.com If not, I don't know where else to get it.
130	Things are great with us...hope so with you too!
130	Fletch
131	thanks for your time!
131	fletch
132	Johnny, Please contact this individual and bring him in as soon as possible for a round of interviews with me, Kevin, Dana, Harry, Doug Gilbert-Smith.
132	Thanks, Fletch
133	Iris, I don't have a copy, but they have a lot up on the gas floor (32nd).
133	Thanks Fletch
134	Kim, Accomplishments are attached below...
135	not really...Edison Mission was selling next week this morning.
136	Maggy, I think as long as someone from legal will accompany me I'd be fine with it.
136	My schedule is fairly open this week after 3:30.
136	Fletch
137	I don't know...it depends on what you want me to talk about.
138	thanks Gregg, great info fletch
139	re:?
140	thank you for a great 1st half of the year!
140	fletch
141	ok, re?
142	disregard previous reply...will meet after 4pm any day fletch
143	Any truth to the rumor about Johnny leaving the group (not the company)?
143	Fletch
144	heard it down here from D. Gilbert-Smith...don't know where he heard it.
145	right, but he's in the gossip circle pretty deep
146	seems like?
146	If you think about it, it might not be a bad deal for Johnny to get "booked out" and go run the crude group or something like that.
146	he probably wouldn't fight it too much given those nightmares he still has about last year's second half!
147	I printed out what you sent me earlier, have not read it yet, and can only meet after 3:30.
147	That's the best I can do.
147	Fletch
148	golf @ houstonian early Sun am?
148	I might have an "in" with Frank (Pickles) at Amerex.
149	Lynn, I'm going to be on personal vacation that week so I'll be unable to attend.
149	Maybe next year.
149	Fletch
150	Kim, Don's looks good and I'm adding Maria's to it right now.
150	will send back to you in a couple of minutes.
151	thanks for your help fletch
152	It's too bad I don't have the authority to trade it...!
153	What do I need to do to get approval to trade crude?
153	I'm officially bearish now...would be selling wildly short right here @ $27.50 fletch
154	thanks for the update!
155	Laura (team leader), I'll be unavailable to work on the skit video this Thurs (8/9) thru Mon (8/13) as I will be in Pennsylvania on vacation.
155	I have plenty of time this tues or wed after trading or next Tues - Thurs after trading...let me know.
155	Fletch
156	I give through paycheck withdrawal every month.
156	Fletch Sturm
157	I'm fairly busy this week, but could manage half an hour today from 3:30 to 4:00...otherwise, it'll have to be next week sometime.
157	Let me know over the phone...I may not have time to check my e-mail for the rest of the day.
157	Fletch 3-9684
158	oh...that's new...Yes, I'd like to roll-over what I've been contributing the past few years.
158	thanks, fletch
159	thank you
160	Lloyd, I was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.
160	My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?
160	It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.) I talked to Rogers about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.
160	Let me know what you guys think...
160	Fletch

203	We'll see how she likes it.
203	As for lunch, it looks like we'll have to make it some other time as I have lunch with my group today, I'm leaving before lunch tomorrow, and I'm taking Fri off.

210	I need a hard copy this morning.
210	Thanks, Fletch
211	thanks...I'll look into it.
211	Fletch
212	This dosn't mention anything about an "adapter" for the CD, just battery.
212	I think your girl's on dope.
213	Dad, Thought you might find this interesting (read: confusing)!
213	It's publicly available on the net, so it's ok.
213	How many other companies are going to come forward with their problems or get in deeper trying to "quietly" clean them up?
213	Fletch
214	Please plan to attend a meeting today at 1pm to discuss the UBS transaction and what it means to our operation.
214	TJ will reply with the room information.
214	Thanks, Fletch
215	I don't know what my ID and password are for this thing.
215	Could you help?
215	Thanks, Fletch
216	Kevin, Put Russell down as 100%.
216	He's in San Antonio this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in Houston.
216	I talked to him last night and he had Jeannie Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m. I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.
216	As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.
216	He's in either way.
216	I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.
216	I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.
216	Did you receive a faxed signature copy from Carson yesterday/this a.m.?
217	Amy, If it's not too late, would you please give Mike Carson a copy of his executed document to him?
217	Thanks.
217	He forgot to make a copy.
217	Fletch
218	Tomcat, Sorry it's taken so long, but finally made contact with a guy at Williams regarding your interest.
218	His name is Michael Westbrock and he's the term ComEd trader.
218	I just forwarded your resume to him after speaking with him over the phone.
218	His e-mail is michael.westbrock@williams.com and his phone # is (918) 573-8752.
218	He said feel free to follow up with him directly later this week after he's had time to look into it.
218	Good luck, Fletch
219	All, Please plan to attend a welcome and overview meeting presented by UBS senior management on Wed.
219	1/23/02.
219	The actual meeting is from 10:00am (sharp) - 1:00pm (hopefully just as sharp :) at The Houstonian Hotel on N. Post Oak Ln.
219	at Woodway.

219	I will be going straight to the meeting from home the morning of, so if you need me call my cell at 713-562-4207.
219	Thanks, Fletch p.s.
219	if you know of other former Enron employees that have signed up with UBS and do not know about this meeting, please spread the word.
220	Mike, John Lavorato forwarded an e-mail to me sent by you requesting information on opportunities in trading at UBS.
220	I'd very much like to talk with you again if you're interested in East Power.
220	If you're interested, please send your resume to me and let me know if you could meet tomorrow (Fri. 1/25).
220	We're making personnel decisions here by the hour and I'd like to hear from you as soon as possible.
220	Thanks, Fletch
221	Greg, Wow!
221	What a deal!
221	I just wanted to thank you again for everything these past few months.
221	I can only imagine the toll all of this has taken on you and your family.
221	Everyone is very excited about the opportunity you and Hutch' have given us and we're confident we'll be successful.
221	Thanks again and good luck to us all!
221	Fletch
222	Kevin has asked me to be the commercial lead on continuing and expediting the development of the system for the traders that provided real-time pricing, curve shift, positions, etc. that was in the works last year.
222	Could you please provide me with the names of the IT people I need to contact and/or the lead on the project?
222	Thanks, Fletch
223	please send this to Tamara Jae Black for approval Fletch Sturm
224	Mike, Let's meet this a.m. 9:30.
224	I'm on the trading floor in the new building 6th floor.
224	Fletch
225	Mike, You must not have received my earlier reply in time...I have another meeting right now (10:30am), so can't meet until tomorrow.
225	I'll call you an hour before I'm available in the morning.
225	Fletch
226	Hunt, Attached is Mike Bridges' resume.
226	I talked with him on Fri.
226	and mentioned you might want to talk with him as well.
226	I don't love him, but could use him if the best fit is East Power.
227	Allan, My name is Fletch Sturm, formerly with the wholesale trading group at Enron, now UBS Warburg Energy.
227	I worked closely with Rogers Herndon in East Power for most of last year (you might remember me) and wanted to see if we could begin some sort of dialog in terms of an agreement to retain your services here at UBS.
227	Kevin Presto has asked me to be the main contact to you on behalf of perhaps both the gas and power tading groups.
227	I look forward to discussing this arrangement with you further at your earliest convenience.
227	My contact information is as follows: Fletcher J. Sturm Executive Director UBS Warburg Energy fsturm@enron.com (temporary) Thanks, Fletch
228	Fellas, Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.
228	I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.
228	In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.
228	Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.
228	Thanks, Fletch
229	Mike, We're still letting the dust settle up here.
229	Hunter may want to talk with you upon review of your resume.
229	Either way, I'll get back to you soon.
229	Thanks, Fletch
230	Victoria, Sorry I haven't been able to contact you by phone, but will try today.
230	Can you provide me with a list of the services and fee structures in place with Enron?
230	I'd like to see what we had before so I can compare with what we'll need going forward.
230	Fletch
231	Dan, Tomcat's a good guy who's eager to work his way up on an energy trading floor.
231	Thanks for your help on that.
231	I'm looking forward to buying you a few beers when you come down again.
231	Fletch
232	Mike, I've talked with Kevin about adding another term-trading position position on my desk (TVA, the one we spoke about), and we're still not sure at this stage if that's the best place to allocate talent just yet.
232	For sure, when business is up to the level it was before the crash last year, that's definitely somewhere we'll need to add, but for right now we're still assessing.
232	As I said before, the dust is still settling (i.e. shuffling people and positions) so I still need a couple more days to see what the best fit for you might be.
232	Thanks, Fletch
233	Hi...hope tennis went well.
233	Hopefully calling Frank Morello after this...anyway, Bill Nielsen's # is (281) 583-2937w (281) 744-4150cell p.s.
233	what did you think of Atlantis, other than fear of flying?
234	All, The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.
234	Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.
234	As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.) We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.
234	Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.
234	Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.
234	Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs.
234	(2/7).
234	Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.
234	Have a goodie.

236	Hi!
236	Haven't been able to get a hold of you today on cell or at home...
236	I'm going over to the Front-Porch for a game of Golden Tee before heading home.
236	I'll be on my cell in about 15-20 min.
237	What time is the meeting again on Fri?
237	10am or 10:30am?
237	Fletch
238	Let's meet today at 2:30pm if that's ok with you and the other guys including Larry and Maria.
238	I'll book it upstairs here and provide you with the room#.
238	Fletch Could you please book a room for 7 and reply?
238	Thanks, who is?
239	Mark, Has UBS decided to allow for true netting of cross-commodity exposure with counterparties under the master ISDA?
239	I'd like to know as this is an important pitch to our customers to trade financial products with us in power initially until we receive our physical license.
239	Could you get back to me before 2:30pm today?

241	What's up with that?
241	Also, could you forward the results from Rob Benson's portfolio's to me?

242	Good morning!
242	I talked with Frank's assistant yesterday (he was out all day) and she said that they can't send an adjuster out without first filing a claim.
242	To that end, she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim (it goes on our record) unless we know there's damage.
242	So, she suggested that I have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and, if there is damage, provide us with his estimate for repair.
242	Then we should file a claim if need be.
242	So, I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us.
242	If you think we should use Joel, I'll call him.
242	But, I feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion, if you know what I mean.
242	Talk to you later.
242	:)
243	Danielle, I'd like to meet with you sometime today (I have a meeting from 10:00 - 11:30) to discuss what we're services we're talking to PIRA about for both gas and power.
243	Please let me know what time you can meet.
243	Thanks, Fletch
244	Yes, 1:30 is good.
244	I'm on the 6th floor in the new building back by the windows in the trading area.
244	There are plenty of conference rooms around here.
244	I'll see you then.
244	Thanks, Fletch
245	If the e-mail I sent you didn't make it, check out this web-site for option-pricing model.
245	fletch
246	Dale, I don't know if you had time to sit with Mitch before he left, but he put this together.
246	It may or may not be useful.
246	Fletch
247	Mark, I posed this question to Mark Haedicke last week and he suggested I ask you: Will UBS allow counterparties that enter into an ISDA with UBS to net exposure between financial Gas and Power positions when calculating margin requirements?
247	If so, to what extent, and if not, why?
247	This would be a major selling point when we're trying to establish relationships with new trading partners and trying to build our financially traded products business.
247	Please help.
247	Thanks, Fletch Sturm
248	Steve, It looks as if we're going to be trading effective Mon (2/11).
248	I'm looking for some assurance that we'll have at least the basics ready to go with regard to position manager.
248	Can you update?
248	Thanks, Fletch
249	yes.
249	how about 1pm, you name the place.
249	thanks, fletch
250	Steve, My computer blew up after I sent back to you reply for meeting at 1:00 ish...are we on?
250	Fletch
251	that's great.
251	thanks, fletch
252	Yes, I do use it, but I'd be glad to talk to someone from Kobra.
252	Thanks for you help.
252	Fletch
253	yes, that's fine.
253	thanks, fletch
254	Danielle, Could you please tell whoever was coming to give me the Kobra lesson at 1:30 that I need to move it to 2:30?
254	Thanks, Fletch
255	thanks, fletch
256	If it's not too late, I don't even need a lesson at all...I'm using my discount broker live feeds.
256	thanks, fletch

115	figures
116	he first detailed allegations that Enron abused mark-to-market accounting to hide wholesale trading losses have emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided by a professor and former deriva-tives trader who reviewed the Enron case for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
116	Those charges, along with allega-tions that have surfaced that mark-to-market accounting was misused by Enron Energy Services, the company's retail energy and services unit, are expected to support the push by accounting rulemak-ers for much more disclosure on mark-to-market accounting practices and the impact of mark-to-market accounting on earnings trading firms' earnings.
116	In testimony Thursday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty of San Diego Law School, said it appears that Enron traders mismarked forward curves and manipulated the amount of profits and losses that would be reported in financial statements.
116	"In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives Enron traded," said Partnoy, who reviewed the case over several weeks at the committee's request.
116	"It appears that Enron traders selectively mismarked their forward curves, typically in order to hide losses."
116	"Traders are compensated based on their profits," he observed, "so if a trader can hide losses by mismarking forward curves, he or she is likely to receive a larger bonus."
116	Partnoy said mismarking forward curves was not the only problem.
116	"For each trade," he testified, "a trader would report either a profit or loss, typically in spreadsheet format. These profit-and-loss reports were designed to reflect economic reality. Frequently they did not. Instead of recording the entire profit for a trade in one column, some traders reportedly split the profit from a trade into two columns. The first column reflected the portion of the actual profits the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent financial statements. The second col-umn, ironically labeled the 'prudency' reserve, included the remainder."
116	Partnoy told the committee that in his estimation, "Enron's 'prudency' reserves did not depict economic reality, nor could they have been intended to do so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund that could be used to smooth out profits and losses over time. The portion of prof-its recorded as 'prudency' could be used to offset any future losses," he said.
116	He recommended that investigators question Enron employees who were involved in these transactions "to get a sense of whether my summaries are complete."
116	Alleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge

273	Ken Fowler is the man at TXU that someone needs to talk with about getting Feb. gas settled.
273	His number is 214-875-9516
274	cool.
274	have you gotten weekend nominations?
275	any chance of you coming over here, when you get a minute
276	rock on
277	thanks
278	he in question is a fag
279	Need market indications for trunkline stx basis and index for the term Jun02-Dec07.
279	If you cant find it, give me Trunk ela.
279	Thanks Joe
280	Hey, thanks for fowarding my resume.
280	Let me know if you have any questions.
280	Joe
281	What's the status of the Bridgeline Transportation and Storage?
282	Sure would like to be able to sell that inventory.
283	talking today
284	ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.
284	The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31.
284	ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.
284	Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg).
284	I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.
284	I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow).
284	Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.
285	Let me know when you have a minute.
286	Hey, got a call from Jeff Smiron.
286	Apparently he has an invoice he needs to send.
286	Do you want to call him and give him a fax so he can send it.
286	Thanks
287	just the messanger
288	I have removed the pricing from that ticket.
289	i ll send it
290	call me when you get this
291	cant make it on may 4, that is the date of the kids birthday party
292	Yep, still here.
292	Things are pretty slow, just waiting to get the hell out.
293	I received it and forward to Ed.
293	Sorry about your loss.
293	Let me know if there is anything else you nee dofr me to do.
294	Hey, can you see if these basis and index have moved since the last time we checked and refresh the nymex for me.
294	Thanks, Joe NYMEX indication on the nymex for jun 02/dec 07 is 3.651 Basis: Index: trunkline s texas is index-1/ index+1 for jun 02/ dec 07, and the trunkline, la index indication is index flat/ index +1 jun02/ dec07
295	we recieved gas from Duke Field Sevices(flow dates: dec4-31 on mrt) and deliverd it to Oneok per a sale agreement entered into pre 12/1/02
296	your assuming i am spelling it right
297	Here is a response from Shemin regarding the gas that we received on MRT from Duke Field Services.
297	I would like to know if I can seek the necessary approvals to pay Duke for the volumes.
297	Thanks Joe
298	got a call from duke.
298	They filled the position.
299	do you know where i can find the list of bankrupt companies
300	let me know more details.
300	i am interested
301	After speaking with Linda, it appears they have a claim against ERAC ( Enron Reserve Acquisition Company), a non bankrupt entity.
301	Ed, who do you think I should have Linda Roberts send a letter stating GLO's position?
302	Ponderosa Pines Energy Partners will be taking 25000mmbtu per day for the month of April.
303	Sent notice to Williams.
303	They imediately responded that they had credit issues and were waiting to hear from us about the letter of credit.
304	Thought you would want to look at this.
304	Thanks, Joe
305	Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report.
305	Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report.
305	I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price.
306	I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage.
306	They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond.
306	Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT.
306	I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached).
306	I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana.
306	I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions.
306	Thoughts?
306	Joe
307	well, well
308	Shemin, you still stand by what you said below?
309	HEADS UP.
310	Louis has brought up a good point.
310	Are we able to see positions non-PV?
310	also can we get a seperate nymex equivalent basis position
311	I will try to pay Duke Field Services $293543, ASAP
312	working on it
313	Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean.
313	I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions.
313	I am waiting for a response.
313	I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts.
313	I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas.
313	Any questions give me a shout.
313	Joe
314	Chance, take a look at this file it will give you an ideal of what formate we are looking for on a consolidated report.
314	We need the info non-PVed.
314	Also, the oxy Info needs to be seperated.
314	Info we need is: Wholesale Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv.
314	Index Wholesale Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv.
314	Index EES Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv.
314	Index EES Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv.
314	Index
315	Made some minor changes
316	Ed, I spoke with Linda this morning.
316	If we are intending to buy them gas for April, we need to know ASAP because nomination deadline for most of the Texas Inta-state pipelines ( ie:Lonestar) is tomorrow by 2pm.
317	Scott and Daivd, I sent this to Chance as well.
317	Look at it and let me know if you have any questions.
317	Thanks Joe
318	Ed,wants me to get this deal closed.
318	I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas.
318	He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both.
318	Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field.
318	Lets Discuss.
319	You need to let me know if you want to sell volumes.
319	I have to find a market.
319	Nominations are due Thursday afternoon.
320	Chip, I just want to follow up my voicemail.
320	If you can get with me by the end of the day or first thing tomorrow, I would appreciate it.
320	I am trying to get the Centana Storage resolved and need your opinion/approval on an issue.
320	Thanks Joe
321	This is the latest and greatest from centana.

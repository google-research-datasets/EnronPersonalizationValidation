0	Have you sent our form of guaranty since we're wasting time reviewing several different formats?
0	This should always be our first approach.
0	Also, you had best advise the company that we will not provide an unlimited guaranty (unless you've agreed otherwise).
0	SS
1	Per my voice mail.
1	Please call ASAP.
1	Thanks.
1	SS
2	Mark, I mentioned this problem several weeks ago.
2	Did you ever respond to Willie's most recent inquiry?
2	Sara
3	ECT and Sonoco entered into a one- year "plastics" swap which terminated on March 31, 1999.
3	Doug Friedman (plastics trader) has asked that ECT formally demand $60,000 from Sonoco for underpayment on the swap.
3	Sonoco has claimed the existence of a Market Disruption resulting from price reformation in the plastics publication "Monthly Petrochemical & Pleastics Analysis" which caused it to use a differenct Floating Price calculation.
3	ECT disagrees as to the existence of such an event.
3	Doug will contact me this week to review our approach.
3	Please give me a call.
3	Thanks.
3	Sara
4	I spoke with John Nassos.
4	He said that the company just hired a treasury/credit person last week (and that was the holdup on negotiating the ISDA).
4	Mr. Nassos has my phone number and all I can do is wait to hear from him or his outside counsel.
4	Sara
5	As you may already know, Shari Stack will be handling this for ECT.
5	SS
6	check voice mail message.
6	need GT&C to make this go.
6	ss
7	As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the underpayment of $60,000.
7	I need the attachment which I have identified as merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).
7	We discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).
7	Also, instead of the term "Sonoco Price", I would prefer the caption "Floating Price recognized by Sonoco".
7	Please call if you have questions.
7	Thanks.
7	Sara
8	I'll send you a FedEX tonight with my seminar enclosures.
8	Thanks.
8	Sara
9	Yes, I need the chart to reflect EACH MONTH during the term of the transaction.
9	Sara
10	Can you eat lunch at 11:45?
10	SS
11	This evening, ECT faxed comments to counterparty's proposed ISDA to both John Joel and Douglas Marshall.
11	We also resent the Credit Support Annex because counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one.
11	John Joel called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak.
11	I told him to schedule a conference call because ECT was ready and was faxing comments today.
11	I haven't heard from him.
11	SS
12	You should receive the FEDEX package today.
12	I also had a short page of bullet points for insertion (which I'll e-mail) but I was waiting to hear back from Chris Foster.
12	Thanks.
12	Sara
13	Did you have comments on the bullet points?
13	Sara
14	FYI.
14	Maybe this relates to your PG&E counterparty.
15	need to markup and return to Chris
16	Attached is a redraft of your letter.
16	RMT knows nothing about the execution or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a party to that transaction).
16	Also, we have been unable to internally trace the source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.
16	We are trying to trace this through Chase and expect an answer on Thursday (if we're lucky).
16	Otherwise, call me about the letter.
16	Sara
17	Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and conditions).
17	Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.
17	Most counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached Annex A. Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the "executed" confirmation?
17	Do we need to modify our language incorporating the Annex A?
17	Thanks.
17	Sara (713/853-5620)
18	Yes, I have received your message.
18	I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad at the Big G and it was wonderful.
18	Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.
18	We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.
18	The weather in N.O.
18	was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.
18	Things are rocking along here.
18	I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% convinced to do it).
18	It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the clinic myself but I can drive the following day.
18	Maybe they'll come up with something to help my brain.
18	Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.
18	I guess you heard that Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.
18	(So is Julia Heintz's mother, by the way).
18	Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died of liver cancer.
18	I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y. It snowed in Phoenix (it was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y. So, Carson, what's new with you???????????????????????????
19	Lisa Palmer and I had a conference call with the Xerox lawyer and commercial person.
19	The main issues are the following: No CSA (claim to have over 40 ISDA Masters none of which contain CSA's! and not set up to handle collateral) Rating downgrade is a Termination Event.
19	(Maybe they'll agree to our posting MUST have cross-acceleration (POLICY). Guess what else? NO NETTING (can't handle netting internally) Otherwise, Xerox is cool.
20	Just got off the phone with the lawyer.
20	We have only minor comments and he needs to check with his credit people regarding the collateral threshold.
20	I will wait to hear back before sending out a revision.
20	Sara
21	Per: You don't need to do a thing!
21	Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.
21	Have a good weekend.
21	Sara
22	We're still trying to trace the wire.
22	And Elaine is happy with my new letter (so far).
22	I'll keep you posted.
22	SS
23	Hey, Carson!
23	Sorry to hear about you and Melissa but I know that life can always get better (if you let it).
23	I've finally finished my two-year project of replacing most of my landscaping with "native plants."
23	Of course, I'm rarely home to enjoy them but everything looks great on the weekends.
23	I'm dying under a load of work here but I know better than to complain too much.
23	GO ROCKETS!
24	Irene: Due to the lateness of discussions at Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., I did not send any documents to you this evening.
24	However, I do have two different sets of drafts to send to you in the morning.
24	I have an ISDA without an annex (collateral built into the Schedule) and an ISDA with an annex.
24	We have had discussions regarding the use of Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds as acceptable forms of collateral and I may need some additional time to resolve the issues.
24	I will contact you early tomorrow to deliver docs and establish a timeline (if possible).
24	Thanks.
24	Sara
25	Under "Legal Issues ...", the fourth bullet point: capitalize the words "Exemption" and "Eligible Swap Participant".
25	I'll be in the office for the next few days if something comes up.
25	Sara
26	Rod: Will we agree to this?
26	Do you want to call this person?
26	or should I?
27	London traders are transacting from London in the names of both ECT(Houston) and ECTRIC(London) with DAPSA and Sempra.
27	The deal tickets are still being sent to Houston for confirmation preparation (rather than from London where the trade is actually consummated).
27	With respect to Sempra, we were previously advised that Sempra would not transact directly with ECTRIC absent a Master but this cannot be accurate because some Sempra deal tickets recite ECTRIC's name.
27	This message is FYI if there are no regulatory issues involved.
27	Houston will certainly document back-to-back internal transactions.
27	Sara
28	Dan: please see if the attached draft works.
28	My extension is 35620.
28	Sara
29	We have finally agreed as the content of letter and I may need Gary to sign it.
29	Do you happen to have a copy of an agreement signed between ECT (or RMT) and EI as to this deal?
29	SS
30	Attached is a copy of the letter that Dan is currently reviewing.
30	Sara
31	The draft you received has been approved by Dan.
31	If you would like this executed, please let me know.
31	Sara
32	letter on ECT letterhead and signed
33	Thanks so much for you help!
33	I can't begin to tell you how many phone calls I've had from people all over the world on this tiny matter.
33	Sara
34	I spoke with Joann Bigwood at Harvard and she will negotiate the agreement.
34	We will comment to their prior draft.
34	I'm in CA until Thursday.
34	SS
35	Tom Kabat, Senior Resource Planner, Resource Management Division for the City of Palo Alto, Utilities Department, gave me his card yesterday and said he wanted to get an ISDA started for future trading.
35	He asked if we had ISDA's with any other cities, that is, it might make his job easier.
35	Are you guys sending follow-up letters to the attendees?
35	SS Phone: 650/329-2659 Fax: 650/326-1507
36	Keep this for future reference.
36	Sara
37	FYI
38	(1) Susan sent PSE&G a sample ISDA on 5/5/99 (2) I spoke with attorney on 5/13/99 and am awaiting further credit info from the CP before turning around a draft.
38	By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Susan to follow up and report back to you.
38	Sara
39	Will you follow up with this guy?
39	Great seminar.
39	I enjoyed your talk.
39	SS
40	Sheer volume!
40	(has kept me from being up to date).
40	It's at the top of the list and I promise it by next week.
40	I do need to speak with you about this Duke issue which has apparently created some confusion over here.
40	Seems to me there are three issues here: (1) ECT's consent toDuke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC releasing the master to its affiliate, (2) credit's assessment of trading with two Duke entities and (3) issues particular to trading power in Argentina (if any).
40	Who is in charge of addressing Duke?
40	SS
41	jointly to Morris Clark and Steve Douglas
42	What is Merrill?
43	Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya Rohauer will know.
43	FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT International."
43	SS
44	I haven't sent it yet.
45	I'll call.
45	Sara
46	My fax number is (713) 646-3490.
46	SS
47	Per your voice mail, attached is a format for an ISDA collar.
47	This form has not been finalized by legal but contains the essential elements for a collar transaction.
47	You can eliminate the account info and set up as per usual ISDA format.
47	Sara
48	Karola Pearce (inhouse lawyer) just returned my call.
48	PG&E has created a NEW document (that is, we should ignore everything previously negotiated) and will FEDEX to us this week.
48	I hope we can negotiate the new document quickly.
48	Let me know if you have any questions.
48	Sara
49	Left voice mail for Miriam Radach at Sherman & Sterling.
49	I'll let you know when I hear back from her.
49	SS
50	Libby Rutherford would appreciate a short explanation from you regarding the cross default threshold.
50	She was interested in knowing which financials we were reviewing together with the explanation.
50	Our latest draft provides all parties with $100 million.
50	Libby's e-mail address is: rutherford@pg.com
51	I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).
51	She was unaware of any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.
51	Sempra does have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our respective companies have been transacting.
51	Of course, all confirms she reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).
51	Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate further confusion.
51	Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.
51	Sara
52	ADDENDUM: I received a phone call from the Sempra lawyer this afternoon.
52	She said that Sempra has no problems trading with ECTRIC.
53	Please follow up on NY Elec & Gas because they'll never call back.
53	SS
54	Prior trades already confirmed last week.
54	Sorry.
55	SUPER CONGRATULATIONS!
55	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
56	SUPER congrats!!!
56	Can I buy you lunch before the millenium?
56	SS
57	Did you understand my message?
57	Please give me a call.
57	S
58	It seems that Miriam Radach has been transferred to Sherman & Sterling's Washington D.C. office.
58	She is working with a NY associate named Jennifer Kumble.
58	The lawyers had a lot of issues to discuss with Tiger and should give us comments next week.
58	Have a nice holiday!
58	I'm going to Baton Rouge to watch the tigers (LSU!) play ball.
58	Sara
59	Let's catch up when you're ready.
59	1.
59	Received NEW draft from Pacific Gas & Electric.
59	Need to do ISDA comparison.
59	2.
59	Susan is out JUNE 1 and "Columbus Dispatch" needs to be finalized.
59	We sent blackline Friday afternoon.
59	Details will happen Tuesday morning.
59	3.
59	Let's talk.
60	FYI
61	Looks fine to me.
61	SS
62	Please put on my calendar.
62	SS
63	FYI
64	I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.
64	I would say for the most part that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers understand our position.
64	Big issues: arbitration (I need an explanation in order to go to our general counsel) Limitiation of Liability All else is negotiable.
64	SS
65	Since the Master is drafted for ECT/TBS, what does your message mean in terms of moving the ISDA, guaranty and side letter along?
65	As I mentioned to Ted, what EI or an EI project company does outside of the ECT swap is not something that I can track.
65	Thanks.
65	SS
66	I just received this message from Mark.
66	Let's talk and I can see what I can do.
66	I'm not aware of any written broker agreements used by ECT for trading other than those for futures and equities.
66	I can check on the physical side.
66	SS
67	I have an 8:40 am eye doctor appointment tomorrow morning.
67	SS
68	Attached is a draft list of items for review.
68	Some of the items require immediate document revisions; others require policy decisions before revising the documents.
68	Please edit and refine.
68	Mark suggested that we confer and come up with specific recommendations.
68	Once we create a list, let's try to meet on one or more occasions to discuss.
68	SS
69	Attached is my list of financial power deals.
69	Are there others?
70	I don't know why you never received this message!
71	yes
72	You should contact ECT's counterparties periodically throughout the negotiation process, as warranted.
72	Please call NYSEG to follow up.
72	Also, Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can review the ISDA together.
72	If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch with our counterparties, please chat with me.
72	Thanks.
72	SS
73	FYI
74	The draft is ready to go but we need one (1) item from credit.
74	Hopefully, this should be resolved within the hour!
74	Do you want a copy?
74	SS
75	Just received this message this very minute.
75	The draft already went.
75	Sorry.
76	Susan should have already checked with the counterparty.
76	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
77	Sorry for the extreme delay in getting back to you.
77	I have not forgotten and will get to this as soon as possible.
77	Sara
78	Trying to set up conference call with Tiger (will advise).
78	Enron Corp. lawyer out of town until tomorrow afternoon; trying to find another Corp. lawyer to review the guaranty.
78	Also, received e-mail from Harvard asking when I'd respond.
78	Is this just a routine request?
78	SS
79	I'm always in town.
79	Just let me know when you're going to be downtown.
79	Nothing new here either!
79	Just work, work, work.
79	I hope to get away for the fourth but one never knows.
79	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
80	As we just discussed.
80	SS
81	I will have the letter executed.
81	I changed references in third to last paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name wtih Robert Loughran, ext.
81	142.
81	Do you assume responsibility to transmitting to Canadian immigration or do we?
81	Please explain the process.
81	Thanks.
81	Sara
82	the lawyer, of course!
82	SS
83	am I nuts?
84	That will work just fine!
84	Just let me know where to meet.
84	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
85	It's OK this time.
85	The Determination Period in this confirm is confusing; exchange-based price sources should be tied to the delivery month/Determination Period.
86	With respect to this counterparty, you may continue to agree to these IDENTICAL early termination provisions until otherwise notified by credit.
86	SS
87	When do I get to see you?
87	What are you doing for the fourth?
87	When are you going to visit Miami?
87	When do you want to eat sushi?
87	SS
88	Per my voice mail, attached are replacement changes for paragraph 2 of confirms for the referenced products.
88	SS
89	When you return from your trip, please follow up with respect to your entry to Canada through Calgary.
89	We are revising your letter and Kevin Zemp will be available to assist you through immigration with the appropriate officers.
89	SS
90	I'm busy today and tomorrow.
90	But I'll book up to 60 days in advance (like the French Laundry in Napa) for you.
90	SS
91	I know that we try to limit the provisions but we should consider: 1.
91	confidentiality (in the miscellaneous section, perhaps) 2.
91	setoff where there is no early termination date (is this covered by NY/TX state setoff laws?) I'll try to meet with Carol and Shari next week to develop a list of issues/recommendations for you.
91	We may come up with more omnibus items.
91	SS
92	I am currently reviewing.
92	Jeff H. will respond re: necessity for Fallback.
93	Could I please have a copy of the final?
93	SS
94	Of course it works!
94	Had lunch just now with Carson Llewellyn.
94	He's in private practice in Houston and said things had slowed down a bit here.
94	Have a great weekend.
94	SS
95	I want to join.
96	I have three utililities almost ready to go; we were sorting through issues related to Canadian regulated entities.
96	SS
97	Thanks!
98	I have three Canadian utilities almost ready to go; checking Canadian legal issues.
98	Sara
99	It was and my apologies.
99	Sara
100	Don't worry
101	Per our conversation, I'll be happy to assist Lucy during your absence.
101	Sara
102	Per my voice mail, attached is the short letter I originally approved to explain the situation.
102	Thanks for your help.
102	Sara
103	Thanks for your help!
103	I'll let you know what I learn.
103	SS
104	Am reviewing now.
104	SS
105	I know they approved the opinion but it is redundant.
105	I'll show you what I think should be changed.
105	SS
106	Sure.
106	Also, this confirm needs to be tracked b/c counterparty needs to fulfill a condition for ECT.
106	SS
107	Attached is a suggested form of opinion.
107	Let me know if you have any questions.
107	Sara
108	left you a voice mail.
108	Have we ever done a basis swap with Phibro or the UK entitiy?
108	What is the payment date?
108	This deal concluded about a month ago.
109	After our meeting, I also agreed to provide suggested language for hedge funds.
109	It is attached.
110	Attached is an updated list of issues based upon our meeting of July 2, 1999.
111	Of course I received this except that it arrived at 9:40pm last night.
111	The mansion was FAB!
111	and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.
111	I am currently into Danish modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).
111	Star Canyon was outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems (which we had been trying to locate).
111	And, yes, we went to a museum with Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.
111	We also saw "Run, Lola, Run" which is a cool German film with English subtitles.
111	I wish you would show Mother how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo!
111	so that she could check her stock portfolio periodically.
111	I spoke with Daddy this morning but he had to cut me off as usual.
111	See you soon, dahling!
111	CALL ME when you get this message.
111	Sass
112	Left you a voice mail.
112	Check with Stacy or Jeff.
112	Is Janice back?
113	a basis swap?
113	A CFD is merely a swap!
114	Please put on my calendar with respect to "POLAND"
115	Let's schedule a time to talk.
115	Sara
116	Do I have to diall in for this conference call?
117	Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999 memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?
117	I would like to discuss your analysis and any further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.
117	I have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.
117	I'm not sure if we'll get there.
117	I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or externally.
117	Sara
118	Is that desk doing options (NOT SWAPTIONS!)?
118	Why are you asking?
118	There are many issues on the paper desk regarding options.
118	Sara
119	I want to have the Canadian lawyer finalize docs in a timely manner.
119	Please advise me of your plans.
119	Thanks, Sara
120	This applies to all counterparties!
121	Attached is a form (NOT OFFICIALLY APPROVED) for use with the omnibus.
121	It is different from the version which you e-mailed to me earlier.
121	SS
122	Attached is a "high volume" counterparty list for two categories.
122	With respect to the first category, Carol is handling BPAmoco and I am speaking with Cargill.
122	Should we address Neumin?
122	And should we actively try to replace existing ECT masters with ISDA's?
122	Sara
123	Anita: It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots going on!
123	I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore vs. what is confirmed in London).
123	Is there a written set of procedures that I can see?
123	Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons?
123	anyone else?
123	Please send me an e-mail.
123	These issues are arising because of my involvement in working with the Brazilian office.
123	Thanks.
123	Looking forward to speaking to you soon.
123	Sara
124	Carol St. Clair has the VEPCO proposed guaranty in hand and will contact you soon.
124	Thanks for reminding me.
124	Sara
125	Will send the MARKUP of the Axel Johnson Inc. guaranty later today.
125	I have inserted several provisions.
125	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
126	Hope you had a great vacation!
126	Please let me know when you have some time so that we can talk about Brazil.
126	I'm trying to update the info that Yao left me and I am now being called by Gary Hickerson's group for a progress report.
126	Sara
127	Hello there!
127	I know that you are out of the country.
127	Thanks for forwarding the message from Andre Cangucu.
127	I have been through your materials but do not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., "Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil", "Trading with Brazilian Counterparties", etc.).
127	Am I missing something?
127	Look forward to seeing you soon.
127	Sara
128	Per my voice mail, please contact me regarding swaps and other derivative activity in Brazil.
128	I am replacing Yao Apasu as the Houston based trading lawyer.
128	Houston/Buenos Aires have been in contact with lawyers at Tozzini regarding financial trading matters.
128	Would like to discuss issues with you.
128	Are ;you talking about OTC or exchange traded swaps?
128	commodity?
128	equity or fixed income?
128	Please call and send your fax number.
128	Thanks.
128	Sara phone: 713/853-5620 fax: 713/646-3490
129	I remembered!
129	Do we have access to the website(s) of the publications which we receive in order to do searches?
129	We must have a password.
129	Thanks.
129	Sara
130	Hello!
130	Please send me your fax number.
130	I have a list of "Final and Proposed Regulations" which needs to be updated.
130	I would like to fax you the list.
130	Thanks.
130	Sara
131	I spoke with Kevin Zemp this morning and he will e-mail docs to me for review.
131	I'll keep you posted.
131	Sara
132	Attached is a new letter for the July 17 payment which ECT owes Sonoco.
132	Please review for accuracy.
132	If it's OK, one of us can fax (with the settlement statement) on the payment date.
132	Thanks.
132	Sara
133	FYI: split effective for stockholders as of 7/23/99; 2 for 1; as I write this stock dropping.
133	Your analysis, Doctor?
133	SS
134	I have not heard from Andre Cangucu (although he opened the e-mail yesterday).
134	I will contact him again.
134	I sent the index of final and draft resolutions to Andrea on July 12 for updating.
134	Can you schedule some time to speak with Andrea?
134	Thanks.
134	Sara
135	Before I respond to Shari, I would like to chat with you, please.
135	Thanks.
135	Sara
136	Brent, Andrea and I had a "status" conversation this afternoon.
136	Brent will go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.
136	Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the outside lawyer is back from vacation.
136	In general, the three of us are conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading issues.
136	These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).
136	Brent will be discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo.
136	It appears that Brent is the "point person" for dealing directly with the Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be dealing frequently with Andrea).
137	I'm swamped.
137	SS
138	Greetings!
138	Hope there's no confusion about my role in Brazil.
138	I'm replacing Yao Apasu in the derivatives area and I thought he was more involved in the process than he apparently was.
138	I'll be taking direction from Brent and will be available as needed.
138	Thanks.
138	Sara
139	Still waiting to hear from you.
139	Attached is a refinement of your proposal but I don't know if it accurately describes what you want.
139	SS
140	Looks like our counterparty did not have authority to transact.
140	SS
141	We still have outstanding issues under French law.
141	Netting Transactions may not be possible (i.e., may not be enforceable) with any of the French counterparties even if you have an ISDA in place.
141	If netting is not a concern, then we can have separate and unrelated transactions.
141	Are you going to push an ISDA for SITA?
141	Let's discuss.
141	Michael will have to encourage his counterparties to respond to our French counsel; SITA never did.
141	Sara
142	Please review and let's talk.
142	Thanks.
142	SS
143	Hope all is well.
143	How do I get in touch with you?
143	Sara
144	There was a flurry of activity in March, 1997 involving Petron but it was on the physical side and we never made it to the swap issues.
144	Again in April, 1998, Manuel and John Enerson began looking into the issue of gaming statutes in an effort to attack legislation in the Philippines.
144	No further legal work was ever attempted.
144	Hope this helps.
144	Regards.
144	SS
145	Andrea Bertone forwarded the recent memo about the new Brazilian Regulatory Affairs' Database.
145	I can access the index through Enron's intranet but I receive the message that Netscape cannot acces the address " when I try to access one of the six parts of the database. I am an ECT user (not Enron Development). Can you help me to access the site or tell me what I need to do to view legislation, documents, etc.? Thanks very much. Sara
146	Thanks for your response.
146	My prior message to you was in error because I did enter the correct address.
146	For example, I can get to the screen that says "Documents" but when I click on one of the choices, I get a message that says "Netscape is unable to locate the server ei-sp-data01. Please check the server name and try again."
146	Am I doing something wrong?
146	Should I simply call the Helpdesk here in Houston?
146	Thanks.
146	Sara
147	Please let me know if you think that this works for Canada.
147	Sara
148	RE: Deal Nos. EY 6926 ECT does NOT have a master with The Dow Chemical Company.
148	Are these trades booked on an omnibus?
148	I am not certain that credit approved these trades.
148	Are they all propane?
148	We need to discuss.
148	SS
149	FYI.
149	Let's talk later.
149	SS
150	All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc. The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of "The Dow Chemical Company".
150	Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved the changes.
150	Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.
150	SS
151	The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I believe is your Dow trader.
151	Mike is trying to trade financially under the name "The Dow Chemical Company".
151	ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY WITH "DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC" (the party that ECT has a Master Agreement with).
151	ECT will NOT agree to change the counterparty on any future trades.
151	When you speak with Mike Billings, you may alert him to this.
151	Thanks.
151	Sara
152	If I call you at 3:30 pm Houston time, will you be available?
152	SS
153	Suggested conditional language (not knowing rest of paragraph): 1.
153	On or before July ___, 1999, Counterparty and ECT shall execute an ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex (the "Master Agreement").
153	2.
153	Contemporaneously with the execution of the Master Agreement, Counterparty shall amend this Transaction and Transaction ____ (each a "Prior Transaction") to provide that (a) each Prior Transaction shall be governed by and subject to the Master Agreement, (b) any Annex B or Annex B-1 supplementing the confirmation of each Prior Transaction shall be terminated as of the effective date of the Master Agreement and the provisions of the Master Agreement shall then govern each Prior Transaction and (c) certain language contained in the confirmation of the Prior Transactions shall be changed from (i) "Determination Period" to "Calculation Period", (ii) "Alternate Floating Price Source" to "Fallback Reference Price", (iii) and any reference to "Floating Price Source" shall be deleted.
153	PS Dale, please read and let me see in connection with the rest of the economic terms
154	My fax number is 713/646-3490.
154	Thanks.
154	SS
155	Here's the info for documentation.
155	Please call.
155	Sara
156	I am advised by the EI help desk in Houston that I must obtain EI security clearance before I can be granted access to this database.
156	Are you able to assist me by sending a message to EI security?
156	Thanks.
156	Sara
157	I need your expertise.
157	Attached is only a start.
157	SS
158	Received copy of deal ticket.
158	What's going on?
158	Sara
159	Jeff says Floating Price language is ok.
159	SS
160	FYI - here's the info I just received from the "ECT trader" in Buenos Aires!!!!!!!!
161	FYI
162	I've been working with our desk to create draft confirm which Brent received yesterday.
162	Should I be dealing with Julian?
162	SS
163	Please review the attached letter and comment.
163	I'll be glad to sign or would you prefer?
163	Sara
164	When you have execution copies ready, have Kaye type on letter for me to sign.
164	Thanks.
164	SS
165	I'll review the guaranty after lunch.
165	Have we sent our comments back?
165	Lisa just did a 5-year deal with Xerox!!!!!!!!!
165	ss
166	FYI
167	We are still waiting to hear from you about the confirm.
167	Please call or
168	There is no message here.
168	Sara
169	I have an allergist appointment at 8 am on Monday.
169	I should be in by 9 or shortly thereafter.
169	SS
170	FYI - please put entry in Lotus Notes.
170	ss
171	SAS is thinking about you (even if you are not in your office).
171	What's going on?
171	Just tried to call but the line was busy.
171	Remember when we put on plays?
171	Did I always interview you (as mother)?
171	You had a great wig.
171	Remember the lyrics to "The Egg"?
171	Wanna do another play?
171	SAS
172	The last time that we spoke, ECT was not going to hold the risk on its books.
172	If there is a back-to-back, which of the six "Enron Argentina" entities (or some other Enron company) will the transaction be with?
172	Sara
173	Did you receive my voice mail yesterday about Pacific Corp?
173	Portland wants draft ISDA to proceed with monetization for this project.
173	SS
174	What have you decided about Dow going forward?
174	Please call.
174	SS
175	I spoke with Dale Neuner (confirm desk) a few minutes ago.
175	It seems that Scott Neal sent the deal ticket to EI and not ECT.
175	We have retrieved the ticket and Dale is talking to Scott about having the deal entered into trade capture.
175	Dale is in touch with Brent and will advise when deal has been entered.
175	SS
176	Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.
176	Credit has given the O.K.
176	to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company.
176	We will document trades on the "omnibus" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an ISDA with the counterparty.
176	Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from "Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc."
176	to the parent company.
176	We waste too much time and energy.
176	Call if you have questions.
176	Sara
177	The Trade Date should be July 23, 1999.
178	Rod: Did you have a chance to speak with Dale?
178	SS
179	Rod Nelson from credit was to speak with you first.
179	Once Rod generates a credit worksheet, I can spin a draft over to you.
179	Sara
180	No I had not.
180	I'm no up on DJ and The Bond Buyer currently requires subscription.
180	Let me know what you learn.
180	Sara
181	I think you ought to get the Canadian utilities out today!
181	Sara
182	Lucy: Please send me the redraft of this document for my files.
182	Thanks.
182	SS
183	Are any of these yours?
183	What's the status?
183	We need to respond.
183	SS
184	I only know what Dale told me.
184	I have no idea who else is involved.
184	SS
185	ASAP - what's going on?
185	SS
186	have we ever agreed to this (charge interest for different Payment Dates) for early payments (i.e., earlier than our usual 5 days after the Floating Price is determinable)?
186	SS
187	You haven't forgotten about the credit worksheet?
187	SS
188	Click on doc for language.
188	SS
189	Pat: Would you please give Marie a call so that she can update Lotus Notes?
189	I'll be talking with Brent later today.
189	Thanks.
189	SS
190	Marie is checking with Pat Cini for latest update.
190	We sent this master on 6/23/99.
190	Also, looks like Pat told you about Empresa.
190	SS
191	Please advise when you guys are ready for the back-to-back.
191	SS
192	This is actually the PacificCorp master which should be redrafted on our new form.
192	There is a RUSH on this and Dale Rasmussen would like to have the master (I would check with him first to see if this should go to anyone else).
192	SS
193	Attached are revised worksheets.
193	We may sign these deals as early as late today or tomorrow.
193	Call if you have questions.
193	SS
194	I spoke with Mark and (after checking one point in the a.m. on jury duty) he thinks that the week of August 16 is preferable for the visit.
194	I will verify this first thing in the morning.
194	SS
195	Do you have further information about your pending trip to Canada?
195	I am reviewing the final letter prepared by Kevin Zemp and he is trying to coordinate with Calgary authorities.
195	I may be out of town during the week of Aug. 16 and I want your trip to run smoothly.
195	Give me a call sometime.
195	Thanks.
195	Sara
196	We would like the opinion to address Section 19(i) of the Accord.
196	Please call.
196	Sara Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
197	Hope this is still on hold.
197	Did Janelle ever prepare a deal ticket?
197	SS
198	Can you give me a call on Friday?
198	Gary Hickerson came by to talk about equity trading.
198	SS
199	Rod will be available at 3 pm to discuss.
199	SS
200	Sorry for the last minute (general unavailability of attendees), but I have arranged a meeting to discuss general issues on the paper & pulp desk at 2 pm in EB 38C2.
200	Dale Neuner, Tanya Rohauer, Rudi Zipter, Ted Murphy should be attending.
200	Please call me if you have any questions.
200	Sara
201	I know it's on your list.
201	I'm only sending this message so that I don't forget!
201	ss
202	FYI - We have not received anything.
202	Have you?
202	ss Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
203	FYI
204	Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority trading.
204	He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for the S. Cone.
204	The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) trading offshore.
204	They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.
204	There appears to be little communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo next week.
204	I'll be more specific in a day or so.
204	I'm still having problems tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).
204	Did you receive my voice mail?
204	SS
205	OK, this is hot off the press.
205	Tanya: our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 1.1 times outstanding exposure.
205	The collateral was defined only as Letters of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.
205	As to the Threshold, well, you can read the response.
205	Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
206	Paul was too nervous using the local firm of Tindall & Foster.
206	Kevin Zemp was recommended by our Calgary office.
206	Kevin refined the prior information and will "pre-clear" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through Calgary around 8/24/99.
206	Do you have any comments to the new attachment?
206	SS
207	Without having more detail, I do know that Gary is interested in trading from Houson (if at all possible).
207	ss
208	Yes, please call.
208	I actually commented to Edmund on this confirm last Friday and he apparently took none of my suggestions.
208	Sara
209	Please note in Lotus Notes.
209	ss
210	Finalizing flight plans here.
210	Will you be flying to B.A.
210	with us from Sao Paulo?
210	If so, will you arrange for transportation from the airport?
210	My assistant Kaye should have our flight info and can coordinate with you.
210	Thanks.
210	It looks as though Andrea B. is coordinating with the business people and outside counsel.
211	FYI
212	Looks fine to me.
212	SS
213	Did a swap 2002-2008 term with BofA.
213	Please send confirm to me upon receipt.
213	Need to negotiate early termination.
213	Thanks.
213	SS
214	Would you please convert this doc?
214	SS
215	Just to update you: 1.
215	I think that our travel plans are fairly well set and I know that Kaye has spoken with you on several items.
215	2.
215	Mark wanted to be sure that in Sao Paulo, meetings were being scheduled with outside counsel (which I believe Andrea is handling), with Randy Young (can you attend to that please?) and ESA necessary commercials (Andrea handling?).
215	3.
215	Mark wanted to make certain that we got on Don Black's calendar while in B.A.
215	Could you look into that as well?
215	For my own edification, who are Luiz Maurer and Orlando Gonzalez?
215	Please let me know if there is anything elso you need form me.
215	I'll bring you up to date on Hickerson shortly.
215	Thanks, Sara
216	Attached is a template for an ISDA swap.
216	I will fax a copy of a "real" financial power Transaction (which is routine as opposed to a structured deal!).
216	Call if you have any questions.
216	SS
217	FYI - comments were sent to Duke and Duke's NY lawyer today.
217	I doubt that there will be any issues.
217	SS
218	PLEASE HEAR MY VOICE MAIL!
218	This is a project for RMT!
218	SS
219	Thanks for the faxed info.
219	Do you have access to the Dow Jones Interactive news service?
219	We just recently added it in Houston.
219	SS
220	I located a confidentiality agreement dated Dec. 16, 1998 with Terry B. Wilcock re: proposed intro of ECT to certain Indian tribes, the doc signed by Tom Gros.
220	Please call me in the morning and we can discuss.
220	SS
221	1.
221	Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language.
221	2.
221	A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with respect to counterparty or used our "deemed" language.
221	3.
221	Maybe some of Shari's weather masters excluded commodity items.
221	4.
221	Credit Lyonnais AAA Master didn't address commodities.
221	Are there other AAA masters and/or bank masters like this?
221	5.
221	The paralegals may remember something.
222	FYI: We have several "Total" agreements.
222	I don't know the relationship.
222	Are these commodities global?
222	SS
223	Let me know when you want to talk.
223	SS
224	We are not seeking authorization at this time.
225	FYI - I faxed latest CSA and correspondence to you for our conference call tomorrow.
225	SS P.S.
225	Do you know what the problems are?
225	I haven't heard a word.
226	Do I still need to look at Phibro?
226	Remember, Bernice left this one for me.
227	I have a question about the ISDA Schedule and several comments to the form of confirmation.
227	To whom should I be speaking?
227	SS
228	I am still waiting for the list of products which you are interested in trading with Brazilian counterparties.
228	SS
229	this is the latest paper deemed ISDA.
229	Please mark for content against OUR deemed ISDA.
229	Thanks.
229	SS
230	Dale prepared the docs below before he left town.
230	I have a question on the Schedule and will give you a call later.
230	SS

231	SS
232	Attached is the first draft for Gary's group.
232	Brent: I'll give you a call on Wednesday.
233	Has legal received a credit worksheet on this counterparty?
233	Please give me a call (or John!).

234	Sara
235	Argentine CP.
236	We need to pursue now.
236	SS
237	FYI - Barton Clark called me to discuss spark spread concept.
237	I'll be in Brazil from 8/17-8/20.
237	However, I'll alert Carol St. Clair to the possibility of a call.
237	Sara
238	What's happening here?
238	Please call ASAP.
238	Thanks.
238	SS
239	Rod Nelson in credit forwarded the Gulf request and attachments.
239	ECTC's execution of the No Interest Letter is fine from a legal and credit perspective.
239	I agree wtih your analysis.
239	Sara
240	I will give you a revision to this doc and then I will need this printed on
241	Can we update this information?
241	SS
242	I need to leave the office at 5 pm today.
242	Sara
243	Fine!
244	As both parties are reviewing the issues we discussed yesterday, will you be sending Harvard's form of guaranty for us to review?
244	I will be out of the office next week.
244	Sara
245	As both parties continue to explore the issues which we discussed yesterday, would you like to send us Harvard's form of guaranty?
245	I will be out of the office next week.
245	Thanks.
245	Sara
246	WHERE DOES THIS STAND???????????????????????????????
246	We need to contact Rodolfo.
246	Sara
247	FYI
248	SUBJECT TO LEGAL AND CREDIT APPROVAL (as to a particular transaction), I have asked Dale Neuner on the ECT confirmation desk, to please forward to you a "suggested format" for a pulp and paper confirmation.
248	Dale is an invaluable resource for these deals.
248	Not knowing anything further, I am uncertain as to whether this transaction will be documented on ECT's "omnibus format" or an "ISDA format", so Dale will probably send the omnibus format.
248	Tanya Rohauer is the credit guru.
248	I will update our review of Brazilian counterparties to determine whether we have any legal issues.
248	I will be in Sao Paulo tomorrow afternoon.
248	Sara
249	As you now know, I did not fly to BA from Sao Paulo.
249	Please let me know if you would like to set up a conference call (from Houston) or wait for me to return to Sao Paulo.
249	Sara
250	Can Brent handle this himself?
251	Attached are the latest documents from the ECT power trading group.
251	The documents distributed in March, 1999 were revised recently although no redline is available.
251	There are no other forms currently in use.
251	I'll speak with Elizabeth Sager about pending revisions.
251	Also, I will send to you both my thoughts regarding an action plan for the coming months.
251	Let me know if you need anything further and if I should be copying any business people/legal on our e-mails.
251	Sara
252	I've received a number of e-mails regarding the Duke confirmation.
252	Would you please advise as to status and send me a copy of the final confirm?
253	I will begin circulating a list of ECT/ S. Cone Counterparty master swap agreements.
253	Other than yourself, who else should receive these updates?
253	In particular, I am thinking of commercials in BA and/or Sao Paulo.
253	Would you encourage more frequent distribution?
253	Sara
254	I should be available almost any time.
254	You can check with Kaye.
254	SS
255	Are Pat's conclusions accurate?
255	SS
256	The e-mail references a memo previously prepared by Antonio Felix.
256	Can you tell me the date of that memo?
256	I only have two (2) Tozzini memos (12/26/97 and 2/20/98).
256	Thanks.
256	Sara
257	Please send credit worksheet to Susan Bailey.
257	SS Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
258	Help me understand HOW MANY Tozzini memoranda exist which address financial swaps and derivatives.
258	I e-mailed Michael about this attachment and I think his response was that Antonio Felix ADDED comments to the attachment.
258	I am not clear.
258	I am aware of only TWO Tozzini memos : dated 12/26/97 (physical trading of energy) and 2/20/98 (local derivatives market).
258	Let's all start from the same point.
258	Thanks.
258	Sara
259	I'll be here.
259	Sara
260	I don't even know what they're doing to this area!
260	Maybe this is for new offices.
260	SS
261	Attached is the first report identifying financial master trading agreements generated by ECT's derivatives legal group.
261	This report will be updated and distributed weekly.
261	It only reflects documentation originated by Houston's legal department and the status of negotiations.
261	If you have any questions, please call me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.
261	Thanks.
261	Sara
262	Under separate cover, I am faxing to you a copy of a "Table of Contents" for a collection of memoranda on various Brazilian issues (physical trading, derivatives, tax, etc. which I have copies of. I have also received from you this morning the response of Antonio Felix et al to the inquiry of Gustavo Junqueira. It will become increasingly difficult to monitor our progress with the Tozzini firm if the business people have direct contact with Tozzini and bypass the Enron lawyers. We will not be able to compile a comprehensive review and the requests will become disorganized. Requests for legal research by Tozzini should originate with the Enron lawyers and be addressed to the Enron lawyers. We can then discuss conclusions with our business people (and even meet together with Tozzini). I hope that you concur with this procedure. If you do, I think that it would be more appropriate for you to contact the Tozzini firm to convey the message (and also to our business people). Please call me when you are back in the Sao Paulo office if you have any questions. P.S. I will prepare for you the "mini-book" containing the memoranda referenced above.
263	I would only solicit their comments on other "projects".
263	SS
264	We can add TGS to this list and remind me on Monday to review.
264	Thanks.
264	Sara
265	Please call me at the office (713/853-5620) if you are still around.
265	Otherwise, let's plan to speak with Richard Sanders(litigation) first thing on Friday morning.
265	I have spoken with Julian.
265	Sara
266	I have spoke to Jeff Harbert about the use of "Fallback Reference Price" in the confirms and the need for an additional provision addressing "Postponement" (which will override our defintion of Postponement in the Master Agreement).
266	Please take note of this in preparing new confirms.
266	I have appropriate language.
266	Please call if you have any questions.
266	Sara
267	We will e-mail or fax directly to you and then you can fax to TGS.
267	Susan Bailey will send.
267	Sara
268	Per our conversation of date, attached is ECT's most recent version of the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex designed for use with Argentine counterparties.
268	As we discussed, I would like for you to review this format and determine whether changes are required as a result of legal developments in Argentina.
268	Please call me when you have had an opportunity to review the document.
268	We have had sent out several recent drafts using the attached format.
268	Also, any written materials which might prove useful are always greatly appreciated.
268	Thanks.
268	Sara P.S.
268	I will try to schedule some time when I am in the B.A.
268	office.
269	Do you have her e-mail address?
269	I spoke with her earlier and wrote down " pla@marvel.com.ar ".
269	That address doesn't work.
269	Thanks.
269	SS
270	Via fax, I am sending to you the new and old Annex A forms and a variety of new and old option (cap,floor, call,put,collar) formats.
270	Per our earlier conversation, I would truly appreciate your input.
270	The fax is about 40 pages.
270	Sara
271	Had a typo in your e-mail address!
272	I just spoke with Miriam Radich (Tiger's lawyer) and advised her of ECT's name change effective 9/1/99.
272	She advised that she will revise our docs TOMORROW.
272	Also, we will send a new blackline guaranty to Tiger (terms previously agreed) to reflect name change.
272	Per: It may take several days to have the guaranties executed by Corp. You need to give Marie advance notice on that front.
272	SS
273	Per my fax (37 pages) of 8/29/99, attached are copies of (1) the existing and proposed Annex A (general terms for the omnibus) and (2) proposed option formats for ISDA and omnibus.
273	My purpose was to "ISDAize" the omnibus particularly in the cap/floor/collar world.
273	Please note the Par.2 Payment section and revised definitions.
273	You do not have "old" confirm templates because I cannot acces on my computer (but all was included in the fax).
273	Did you receive the fax?
273	SS
274	I understand that you spoke with Mark Taylor about eliminating references to individuals in confirms.
274	I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted language conforms to your proposal.
274	In that regard, you may recall that swap templates were given to you several months ago.
274	The legal group is concluding a massive form review which necessitates confirm changes.
274	Thanks.
274	Sara
275	In Part C. Financial Swaps of your report, please clarify two "preparing Master Swap" entries: (1) is "Edes" meant to be "Eden", each LDC activity?
275	(2) What is "CGC"?
275	The "under discussion" entries are unknown to us: (2) PDA Thanks.
275	Sara
276	Marie will verify this information first thing in the a.m.: The Duke master is dated August 16, 1999.
276	It was sent for execution (to Carol Graebner in Houston) on August 18, 1999.
276	I cannot verify whether execution copies have been received by ECT.
276	Sara
277	Thanks.
277	When you have Annex A ready, we'll have to tweak Annex B. For example, I think we eliminated the term "Derivative Transactions" in Annex A (but it shows up in the Catalytica Annex B).
277	Bart Clark is the lawyer who is asking to receive the two annexes.
277	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
278	I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, unfortunately).
278	It should arrive next week.
278	I was hoping to spend the week of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa.
278	Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.
278	If I arrive on a Sat.
278	or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting over the weekend to work out a plan?
278	I can then devote all of my time to dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with originators to explain financial trading procedures.
278	I will need to determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.
278	I have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.
278	I know that you are very busy.
278	Please let me know what you think about my proposal.
278	Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend time.
278	Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.
278	I look forward to hearing from you.
278	Sara
279	Although I am still waiting for another Brazilian visa, I would like to pose several potential dates to meet with you regarding Enron North America Corp. trading issues.
279	I am presently considering several time periods: Obviously, I can be available at any time during the month of Septermber as well as future months.
279	But I would like to get started as soon as possible.
279	If you could kindly e-mail or call me (713/853-5620), I can elaborate further.
279	Thank you.
279	Sara
280	FYI
281	A copy of the 8/31/99 letter from Erik Ludtke was received at 18:10 on fax no.
281	"713 646 4818" addressed to the attention of "Assistant General Counsel".
281	This would conform to notices in the master agreement (for Sections 5 and 6), an executed copy of which we have never received or seen.
281	On a different matter, do you think that we can discuss the omnibus templates tomorrow?
281	I am pressed for a response.
281	SS
282	Effective immediately, all questions from the confirmation desk to legal should be routed to a designated paralegal on a quarterly basis (with the exception of the very first rotation) as follows: You will be advised of subsequent rotations.
282	Please do NOT route calls to Tana Jones who will be spending most of her time working on special projects for our group.
282	This procedure should not affect any existing arrangements you may have with a particular attorney.
282	Please contact me if you have any questions.
282	Sara
283	I have advised the confirmation desk of the following rotations: We can continue the rotation on a quarterly basis.
283	Let me know if you have any questions.
283	Thanks.
283	Sara
284	My apologies for leaving your names out!
284	Sara
285	This attachment ONLY changes references from "ECT" to "ENA" to match the name change on the first page of the confirm.
285	We will revise Canadian Annex A in a similar fashion.
285	Subsequent template changes are forthcoming.
285	Sara
286	Do you have a revised "paper group" list?
286	Sara
287	Please schedule a meeting with Tana (at her convenience) to discuss NYMEX hedge exemption and related issues.
287	Thanks.
287	SS
288	Baby steps?
289	works fine for me.
290	You are fantastic!
290	It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which could last until 9/25 or the end of September.
290	Will I have the visa before then?
290	SS
291	Below is the link that I cannot reach.
291	Sara
292	Please take a look at the proposed language.
292	You will need to consider the time period before which a Market Disruption Event will kick in.: Postponement: For the purposes of the definition of "Price Source Disruption," as set forth in Section 7.4(c)(i) of the Commodity Definitions, the Maximum Days of Disruption shall be [thirty-two/sixty-four] days after the last date of publication of World Pulp Monthly, or any successor publication, published by Resource Information Systems, Inc. or its successor for the applicable Calculation Period.
293	The meeting is on our calendars for 9:30 am 9/3/99.
293	Let's talk about the NYMEX hedge exemption/position limits process and the reasons why you need attorney backup when Mark is unavailable.
293	Also, highlighting specific NYMEX rules and regulations/Enron trading policy issues for me would be helpful.
293	I am only looking for broad oversight.
293	We can meet with Mark when he returns (and have Taffy put us on Mark's calendar).
293	Thanks.
293	Sara Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
294	Need to know value of dispute.
295	I need to review the outstanding omnibus confirm for this paper/pulp counterparty.
295	I believe there is only one live trade.
295	Thanks.
295	SS
296	I am still trying to resolve the question of who will advise you on the consulting and other agreements.
296	In the meantime, I have attached a form which you can use to create a report for your group.
296	This would be quite helpful to the lawyers in staffing the group more efficiently.
296	SS
297	Per our conversation, please advise of available dates.
297	We would like to schedule as soon as possible.
297	Thanks.
297	SS
298	please respond to my voice mail - ss Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
299	Please review the attached "paper & pulp" doc for accuracy.

299	Please coordinate through Tana Jones.
299	I do not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.
299	Sara
300	I am planning to travel to Argentina and Brazil in the next 10 days.

300	Enron's office will be closed on Monday, September 6.
300	I look forward to hearing from you after that date.
300	Regards.
300	Sara
301	Thank you for your earlier response.

301	Will you be available for a conference call on Wednesday, September 8?
301	I would like to discuss generally the financial trading issues which I will need to address.

306	I'll let you know shortly.
306	SS
307	Is someone (or all of us) going to bring Susan up to date?
307	I would like for her to coordinate the lunch with the desk on Thursday if that date is selected.
307	SS
308	(1) I can confirm that the swap group has no financial (or physical) info on Bolivia.
308	You may want to check with Alan on the existence of any specific physical reviews on Bolivia.
308	(2) Do you have some time to discuss the omnibus confirm process?
308	(3) Have you heard further of Duke?
309	Our internal phone and voice mail system is all screwed up.
309	Is 3pm Houston (5pm BA) today too late for you to discuss omnibus?
309	I haven't heard a word from Richard.
309	Scott Neal left a message about the Friday letter.
309	Also, Bruce Harris called this morning about the issue of Elektro trading (Hickerson desk).
309	I am hoping that Antonio Felix can talk to me sometime on Wednesday.
309	He's then out for the rest of the week.
309	Coordination is getting complicated.
309	I'm supposed to get my visa today (so I can leave anytime).
309	Talk to you soon.
309	SS
310	Thanks for the quick response.
310	On short notice, Thursday 9/9 did not work.
310	I have two alternatives: Friday, 9/10 and Wed., 9/15.

360	I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.
360	It's a good starting point.
360	I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina which will address both physical and financial trading.
360	Other "guidelines" exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.
360	I am checking on London.
360	I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.
360	Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is about as close as you can get to a third world country).
360	One thing that doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.
360	Let me know how I can help further.
360	Sara
361	see below.
361	It looks like the 2-day L/C issue is an issue.
361	I'll call you shortly.
362	Hi back!
362	and Happy New Year too!
362	To what do I owe this small pleasure?
362	I'm fine in Texas, still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe, working hard, etc. Where are you living these days?
362	N.O.?
362	Atlanta?
362	Memphis?

362	As for me, well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit), you know, the usual.
362	Are you selling burgers up and down the east coast?
362	Have you gone international?
362	In a new franchise business?
362	How's your family?
362	Got to get back to work!
362	This weekend I'm off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires on business.

363	Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines (physical and financial) for the London traders.
363	I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions (first Argentina) and thought your expertise would be very helpful.
363	Could you send me a set?
363	I'm leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow.
363	Thank you for your help.

(iii) definitive agreements acceptable to Party A in its sole discretion regarding the debt and all other aspects of [the project to be owned by Party B], including but not limited to the senior debt facility, commitments and all project documents, have been fully negotiated and executed and the [project] has been brought to financial close.
365	No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.
365	Credit reviews trades each morning and they know what's going on.

370	FYI
371	Please have Gary review this message.
372	yes (Kaye - please place on my calendar)
373	I'll be glad to help you out from Enron's remote offices and while in Houston during the week of Sept. 27 - Oct.1.
373	Please note the following: 1.
373	I'll be in Enron's Sao Paulo and BA offices from Sept 20 - Sept. 24 AND 2.
373	I'll be on vacation from Oct. 2 - Oct. 9 You may need to contact me through my assistant Kaye Ellis (Ext. 35968) or one of the paralegals (try Marie Heard, Susan Bailey or Susan Flynn).

374	No, in general there is a netting issue with French counterparties.
374	The "quick fix" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.
374	The broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a "financial institution" under French law.
374	We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but without success.
374	The next step is to require an opinion from outside counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.
374	ps - Tanya is well aware of the situation
375	is out of the office until tomorrow afternoon.

376	FYI
377	Your switchboard does not answer and I'd like to speak with you.
377	Please call me at 713/853-5620.
377	We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.
377	Enron Capital & Trade Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was virtually identical to the one we're sending.
377	We therefore do not expect there to be many issues.
377	The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.
377	Look forward to finalizing these documents with you.
377	Thanks.
377	Sara
378	I have a 1998 opinion which addresses only a few issues but it's a start.
378	Let me know if we should proceed further.

379	We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.
379	You will need to provide a resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader list and other contacts.
379	We will provide you with drafts.
379	I am certain that the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.
379	For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) or will these accounts become more routine?
379	Just wondering if S. Cone has a formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.
379	SS
380	AA has real problems with loans disguised as swaps.
380	Who is reviewing this from an accounting viewpoint?
380	The accounting treatment could impact the deal.
380	ps.
380	I'm leaving for a 1-week vacation on Friday, Oct. 1
381	Sorry, I've been tied up all day.
381	Rod and I just spoke and he is thinking about the NAV issue.
381	Regarding setoff, we can agree to Tiger's language BUT credit will not permit ENA affiliates to trade with Tiger.
381	That's your issue.
381	Will you agree.
381	We will not agree that all collateral be held in NY.
381	There is still an issue about Relevant Price and the possibility of fewer than three dealers.
381	We cannot finalize L/C and MAC issues until we see Tiger's redraft which we have not received.
381	Let's talk.

382	This is an ECM deal which is supposed to fund Thursday, Sept. 30.

388	I never had a chance to tallk to you about Cuba and I'm totally fascinated with the island.
388	I sat next to this lawyer from NY on the flight from BA to Miami and he's recently separated and wants me to dump Mike.
388	I have a "house sitter" while I'm on vacation (thought I'd try it out since you probably would!).
388	Mike asked the concierge at "The Argyle" to make reservations from a list I prepared.
388	All of your suggestions except Parkway Grill appear.
388	How do people in LA dress for dinner?
388	HELP!

392	The only policy that I've seen is the "Interim Southern Cone Electricity Trading Policy" dated July 29th, 1999 and which does authorize financial electricity trading in Brazil.
392	I'm not aware of policy (maybe there is none) or resolution (maybe each will be deal specific) which addresses the opening of brokerage accounts and equity trading (even for hedging purposes).
392	I think we should monitor the activity and see if it's going to be sporadic.
392	I'll be in the office today until 4 pm.
392	Sara
393	Let me know if this works.
393	Sara
394	Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for netting purposes, the conditions included: 1.
394	The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or occur on a French regulated market 2.
394	One of the parties must be (a) an "investment firm" within the meaning of the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a "comparable status" The term "investment firm" embodies financial type institutions which recieve and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.
394	There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, insurance companies, broker types, etc.) .For example, one murky designation includes "persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do not prohibt the carrying on of investment services".
394	Slaughter and May has advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).
394	There are other categories as well.
394	I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.
394	The non-resident entity having "comparable status" is the category WE were trying for fit into without much success.
394	Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.
394	Perhaps the law has changed and Justin has a recent update.
394	ENA has a Soc Gen master, and we have recently sent a Deemed ISDA to a French corporate (one shot deal only).
395	Mark and I met yesterday.
395	I am NOT making my proposed changes to either Section 2 or Section 8 of the Omnibus other than adding definitions for "Option" and "Floor Amount" to Section 8.
395	This does not interfere with all of our other general changes to Annex A (which include the comment about "Total Premium" which should conform to the online version).
395	So, Annex A is ready to go!
395	Sara
396	Guess what?
396	Lotus Notes prompted me that there was more than one "Marie Heard"!
396	Could this be true or do I have a virus?
396	SS
397	I'm trying to revise Annex A. Mike Etringer (in Portland) would like for this to go out today.
397	I'm leaving at 4 pm.
397	Thanks.
397	SS
398	Can you talk late this afternoon?
398	In connection with the "trading issue", have you taken a look at the services agreement ?
399	Hello there!
399	Hope all is well.
399	Will you be at the legal conference later this month?
399	Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction for which the account is required.
399	Also, for purposes of your unanimous consent or resolution, you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.
399	Let me know if you have any questions.
399	Sara
400	I hope that there is no more confusion!
400	The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for control purposes.
400	ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate workbook).
400	The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the account.
400	We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.
400	I think that Marie previously sent you a form.
400	Let us know if you have any questions.
400	What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?
400	Regards.
400	Sara
401	Would you please verify the accuracy of Parts C and D of Brent's report?
401	Thanks.
401	Sara
402	Remember this one?
402	Does anyone else in underwriting need to see this?
402	SS
403	FYI - Sara
404	Who will be helping me with this confirmation?
405	Regards from Houston!
405	I hope you are well and busy.
405	I just wanted to follow up on our very productive meeting of September 21, 1999.
405	Enron North America and Enron South America are still quite anxious to continue our analysis of the various components of financial trading.
405	I believe that you were going to prepare some type of matrix to help identify the various legal issues and practical aspects associated with financially transacting in Brazil.
405	We would then add tax and regulatory analyses to the possibilities.
405	If my memory serves me correctly, we had identified transactions by the Enron entity ("ENE") as follows: (a) ENE offshore FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian entity (b) ENE offshore (not financial institution) through CC-5 Account with authorized Brazilian bank and Brazilian entity NOTE: enforceability issues with 1(b) 2.
405	local swaps (a) ENE onshore entity and Brazilian FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (or ENE onshore FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian resident) (b) ENE onshore entity and Brazilian entity (not financial institution) registered with the BM&F or CETIP through intermediary NOTE: compliance with existing regulations as to specific reference products is required as to 2(a) and 2(b) 3.
405	"pure" OTC swaps (a) ENE onshore entity and Brazilian onshore entity (b) ENE offshore entity and Brazilian offshore entity NOTE: 3(a) presents enforceability issues under Brazilian law and 3(b) presents no issues whatsoever We look forward to your response as soon as possible and would also like to know when we may hear from you.
405	In connection with your response, please note that we are interested in the recent changes to the laws for acquiring banks (bankrupt or otherwise).
405	Regards to Marcelo and Jose Emilio.
405	Sara
406	Would you please prepare and coordinate with Jeff Harbert?
406	Thanks.
406	Sara
407	Hi there!
407	A quick refresher course for me with respect to French derivatives trading (not a bank).
407	In transacting with a French corporate, should we request articles and bylaws for capacity and ALSO a due authorization opinion?
407	I think that this is correct.
407	However, if we are transacting with an "S.A.", we should NOT request articles and bylaws but only the due authorization opinion.
407	My notes on these items are confusing.
407	Could you please respond in the morning?
407	Thanks.
407	Sara p.s.
407	We are currently operating under the "one Transaction rule" with French non-bank entities in order to avoid the netting problem.
408	I am forwarding to you several e-mails received today regarding this transaction.
408	We are going to send out another draft confirmation for this commodity spread swaption.
408	Sara
409	FYI
410	We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail of date.
410	The original confirm was prepared for "Catalytica, Inc."
410	and the credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North America.
410	Sean has requested that "Catalytica, Inc."
410	be REPLACED with the sub "Catalytica Combustion Systems".
410	Should the credit remain the same?
410	We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from underwriting.
410	Thanks.
410	Sara
411	In an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading issues (primarily related legal and tax perspectives) in the S. Cone, Lynn and I have agreed to conference on Friday, October 15 at 9 am (Houston time) and weekly at that time.
411	Would anyone else like to participate this Friday?
411	If you are interested in participating on a weekly basis, are Fridays at 9 am (Houston time) convenient for you?
411	My immediate concerns are financial trading issues.
411	However, we can focus on all relevant issues as we so determine.
411	I will create a "short list" to initiate discussion.
411	Thanks.
411	Sara
412	FYI
413	Attached is a draft report to initiate Friday's discussion.
413	Please provide comments, suggestions, etc. Thanks.
413	Sara
414	I'm fine with Randy's suggestion.
414	Let me know about you and I'll e-mail Randy back.
414	I am still planning our Friday morning call (it should be short) because I want your input on "tracking projects".
414	Brent will participate and I haven't heard from anyone else.
414	Sara
415	Please fax the entire confirmation.
415	Thanks.
415	Sara 713-646-3490 (fax)
416	Lucy Ortiz on the confirmation desk is awaiting your response re: my e-mail of 10/11/99.
416	Please let us know when you have determined the appropriate counterparty.
416	If you have any questions, please call.
416	Thanks.
416	Sara
417	Sean's comments
418	How would you like to handle?
418	We could do a Deemed ISDA if you feel comfortable that the counterparty will sign the ISDA.
418	How long is the deal?
419	We will conference you in at 9 am (Houston).
419	Thanks.
419	Sara
420	Hope you are well!
420	I had a wonderful vacation in L.A. I never made it to either the Norton Simon or the Getty; I'll just have to plan another trip to the west coast.
420	In connection with your recent review of our standard ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex and legal opinion (the "Documents"), could you please advise as the whether additional provisions are required or advisable in any of the Documents when our counterparty is an Argentine public utility, municipality or other type of regulated entity.
420	In the U.S., we use the ISDA Multicurrency - Cross Border boilerplate and incorporate most of the ISDA municipal language and some of our own into the Schedule for municipals and governmental entities.
420	However, for public utilities which are general corporates (and not governmentally owned), we take a different approach and incorporate language which might trigger an "Additional Termination Event" for "regulatory type developments" (e.g., orders issued by a public utility commission) which would cause or might cause our master agreement to become void or unenforceable or similar swap agreements to become void or unenforceable.
420	For example: "The filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated, to the effect that performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable."
420	By fax, I will send you our Municipal Schedule.
420	Please advise as to changes in both the (i) Schedule and (ii) legal opinion for both (a) public utilities (corporates, non-governmental) and governmental entities (municipals, public agencies, governmental utilities, etc.).
420	Please call if you have any questions.
420	Regards.
420	Sara
421	Randy, I can certainly participate in your Tuesday morning meetings (and I can appreciate the time constraints under which Andrea is working!).
421	I believe that Lynn will defer to Rick's participation.
421	Please let me know if there is a call in number.
421	I think that I will be able to keep you updated through your meetings.
421	My need for meeting with Lynn and Brent stems from the fact that we are "offshore" Brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the fires burning.
421	Have a great weekend!
421	I just got back from my vacation - I went to L.A. - and the weather was extraordinary.
421	So was the food.
421	I'm looking forward to Sao Paulo.
421	Will see you soon.
421	Sara
422	Where is the meeting?

423	Do you mean to say something like this for the second Floating Price: The average of (i) the settlement price for the Novermber NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures Contract on October __, 1999 and (ii) the average of the daily settlement prices for the December NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures Contract for each Commodity Business Day in October, 1999 Please let me know.

427	In connection with the ISDA negotiations, PG&E is insisting on revising our "Limitation of Liability" language" "...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental damages."
427	PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and that certain elements of "Loss" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always agrees to "Market Quotation"). Have you ever prepared a list of the "Loss" components? Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)? Thanks. Sara
428	need attachment
429	Shouldn't someone contact Amoco?
429	I mentioned this to Carol St. Clair last week but I don't know if anyone thought further about it.
429	Sara Enron North America Corp.
430	I know that you were in the Rio office during the latter part of last week.
430	I sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the research/memo.
430	I also called Marcelo Rodrigues and left a message.
430	I have not heard from either you or Marcelo and I am anxious to continue our dialogue.
430	Please e-mail or call at your earliest convenience.
430	Thanks.
430	Sara
431	insert this paragraph as marked on the document.
431	ss
432	Either sounds good.
432	But let's do Friday!
432	SS
433	no way!
433	never mind, OK!
433	have fun.
433	I'll miss you.
433	Sara
434	I am about to engage the Johannesburg firm of Webber Wentzel Bowens to proceed with a response to ENA's questionnaire.
434	ISDA has used this firm.
434	Has ECTRIC done any previous studies in South Africa?
434	Please let me hear from you today, if possible.
434	Thanks and regards.
434	Sara
435	Yes, I've received messages but have not heard from the right person.
435	However, I want to clean up the transaction itself.
435	Why is it a swaption?
436	I see that you completed an ISDA comparison in late September.
436	What has happened with it?
436	SMUD is calling.
436	Can you advise Stuart Rosman ASAP?
436	SS
437	Was this meeting cancelled yesterday?
437	It wasn't on my calendar?
438	I am sitting in on this conference call as I write this message.
438	Brent just mentioned that you were preparing an analysis addressing "trading locations" to present to Don.
438	Randy is interested in seeing your written response.
438	Do you need anything from me?
438	Also, I heard from AFAC by e-mail yesterday and he said that Marcelo was working on a memo (which I was to receive yesterday!).
438	We may need Randy to intercede and keep the lawyers working on ALL projects.
438	Apparently AFAC handles all Central Bank issues for Tozzini and Cuiaba has these issues now.
439	Call me when you're free and we can talk to Rolo..
439	I've looked at their comments.
439	Sara Enron North America Corp.
440	AFAC - Thank you for your response.
440	It is difficult for me when I do not hear from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were engaged in other Enron matters.
440	I am looking forward to your response since the trading issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).
440	Once "the Enron group" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to schedule another meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.
440	I look forward to receiving the memo and chart.
440	Thank you and regards.
440	Sara P.S.
440	Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum.
441	All: I know that AFAC is busy with Enron matters.
441	However, I received this response from him on Monday (yesterday).
441	I have not spoken with either AFAC or Marcelo but it appears that they are very close to at least a "first draft".
441	My thought is that we review the response and identify specific areas and/or issues for refinement and then schedule a meeting in S.P. I'll advise as soon as I hear further.
441	Sara
442	I haven't reviewed yet but here it is!
442	Sara
443	Yes.
443	This would be a helpful "insert" in the negotiations manual.
443	I always worry that we receive explanations about a variety of issues and we don't keep a written record of the advice received.
443	SS
444	Dale: can you have someone review the transaction terms.
444	I'm not sure that this is a swaption.
444	I'll also take a look.
444	I do not have a voice yet but I am in the office.
444	Sara
445	I know nothing.
445	SS
446	David: Could I see a copy of the AMEREX below referenced agreement which you approved?
446	I would appreciate your response today.
446	Thanks.
446	Sara
447	Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I should be in most of the day today).
447	The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.
447	BUT, the broker WILL NOT open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which includes: authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party trading authorization number of signatures for transacting Marie previously sent "samples" of the the underlying documentation to Robert George.
447	We have not received anything to date.
447	When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard copies.
447	Let me know if you have any further questions.
447	Sara
448	You indicated that you'd be finished by Wednesday.
448	Can you give me the comparision?
448	Thanks.
448	Sara
449	So you were able to put Janet in her place!
449	If you have questions, please come in my office.
449	I can write and shake my head "yes" or "no"!
449	Sara
450	Mike, thanks for your patience.
450	I have severe laryngitis so I cannot even speak.
450	I received a copy of the index for the Utah statute to which Deseret is subject.
450	I'm afraid that I need Utah counsel to answer my questions.
450	I'm working on that right now.
450	If you call me, I'll only be able to respond via e-mail.
450	Sara
451	I'd like to attend.
451	SS
452	Sorry I can't wish you well in person but I have a severe case of laryngitis!.
452	Fortunately, I'm on antibiotics but the doctor said "Don't speak for 3 days. I wish my wife would get laryngitis."
452	Maybe the desert air in Arizona would bring relief.
452	I love saguros (is that right?) Daddy thought planning for Chanukah was a great idea.
452	Also, tell Daddy that if he used e-mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.
452	Love, Sas
453	Brent and Lynn: I have a severe case of laryngitis and I can't even speak.
453	I'm not sure that I'll be able to (or even should) speak on Friday for our 9 am (Houston) conference.
453	Brent, I was wondering if you would be in Houston next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.
453	If so, then maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.
453	If not, then let's please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.
453	I can suggest Monday after 10 am.
453	Tuesday morning we have Randy's call which I may have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..
453	Please let me hear from you.
453	Thanks.
453	Sara p.s.
453	I have not had an opportunity to review the memo but I'm going to take a look today.
454	Kaye: I e-mailed David Portz this morning and he hasn't opened the message.
454	Can you please (1) find out if he's even in the office today AND (2) just get a copy of the agreement which Dale is referencing below.
454	Thanks.
454	SS
455	Have you heard if Brent will be in Houston this week or early next week?
455	SS
456	With pleasure!
456	SS
457	Pat, your credit worksheets reflect ENA posting cash.
457	Is this a mistake?
457	I am trying to revise these draft masters and then I will tackle TGS.
457	I still have severe laryngitis so I cannot speak but I can communicate via e-mail or a paralegal.
457	Thanks.
457	Sara
458	I have retained Utah counsel.
458	I'll keep you posted.
458	I haven't looked at your other question yet but I will !
458	Sara
459	The agreement must be executed by a VP or higher level.
459	Do you want us to have Jeff Shankman execute?
459	SS
460	FYI - I don't know anything about this deal other than the fact that Chris Foster asked me a question.
460	I referred Chris to Christopher who had worked on the APEA transaction which had similar issues.
460	SS
461	I thought we had devised a format for any response.
461	I'm glad to meet with you anytime.
461	Currently, I have severe laryngitis and I am unable to speak.
461	I will probably be limited on Friday as well.
461	We can manage if you come to my office.
461	Let me know.
461	SS
462	OK, let me try to catch up here.
462	Brent may not get my e-mail for awhile.
462	I believe that he is in Houston today on personal business and will stay until the conclusion of the ENA legal conference which is Th & Fr next week.
462	What is your availability on Mon or Tues next week?
462	I will try to put something together (at least you and I can have a game plan so that we can plan our next visit to SP).
462	This voice stuff is a bummer.
462	Sara
463	Just got your voice mail.
463	I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice today or tomorrow.
463	Sorry.
463	We can e-mail or speak through Marie.
463	Yes, we have a blackline.
463	Marie has finished going through it and I need to review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).
463	Re: the credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.
463	However, I believe there is still an L/C issue.
463	If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the right to post a substitute L/C within two days.
463	I am not absolutely certain of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.
463	I don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.
463	I was out sick yesterday.
463	Hope this brings you up to date.
463	SS
464	ok just no voice.
464	Thanks.
465	Hey, man, what's up?
465	Have we thought this through practically?
466	Brent is supposed to be in Houston but Mark didn't know if Brent would be in the office today or tomorrow (he has personal business in Houston).
466	You might check with Taffy.
467	Let's do it on Tuesday, Oct. 26 at 2 pm.
467	If Brent is available, all the better.
467	Let me know if you want to visit Enronland.
467	I don't mind the walk.
467	Sara
468	I would like to sign up for the following presentations: (1) Power Marketing - Structuring Power Transactions on November 10 and 11 (2) Fundamentals of Corporate Finance on December 2 Please let me know.
468	Thanks.
468	Sara
469	Sorry, but I forgot to ask if I should make reservations and if anyone else is going.
469	Thanks.
469	Sara
470	Speak of the deviI!
470	I just had someone leave a voice mail for counsel (who is at an outside meeting).
470	I will definitely have a lawyer call tomorrow morning.
470	Is Utah in your time zone?
470	Sara
471	Don't you recall that we created a response or amendment format?
471	What am I recalling?
471	SS
472	Sounds like a great idea to me!
472	Sara
473	I have not yet had a response from Argentine counsel.
473	I will speak with them again.
473	Sara
474	Patricia: I was just checking to see if you have had an opportunity to review our ISDA Schedule for the referenced entities.
474	Please let me know if you have any questions.
474	I believe that Susan Flynn in our office faxed you a copy of our form of Schedule last week.
474	I look forward to hearing from you.
474	Regards.
474	Sara
475	I still can't talk.
475	I think that our response should be final except that there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.
475	Carol St. Clair is addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.
475	In any event, I believe that Tiger needs to "OK" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their redraft.
475	Marie is not in the office today.
475	If you want to speak to a person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage.
475	Have a good weekend.
475	Sara
476	FYI - I have a pretty bad case of laryngitis but I still have to eat lunch.
476	Maybe I can find a "talking person" to join us so you won't be bored.
476	Sara
477	Sorry, but I still can't talk.
477	Although Marie is not in today, I can have Susan Bailey (Ext. 34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs are coming.
477	We also will need a signature on the agreement itself and I can't recall if Marie sent that already.
477	Please call Susan so that we can be more specific about what might happen today (and whether it can wait until Monday morning when Marie returns).
477	I have not received anything from Robert.
477	Thanks.
477	Sara
478	Yes, as long as the Tiger lawyers do their bit.
478	Please call Susan Bailey about the guaranty and she can have it prepared for execution.
478	Question: Are we only preparing the Tiger guaranty or other animal guaranties as well?
479	It looks like we won't have to open the account today.
479	However, we should send the account agreement to the person in Brazil who will sign (or we can send it to the lawyer in Brazil whose name is Robert George).
479	Come see me to explain further.
479	Thanks.
479	ss
480	yes.
480	I'll call you ss
481	Yes, the lawyers have requested separate guaranties for each fund.
481	SS
482	Brent is in the office and would like to finalize the ISDA Master.
482	I believe that we need to send our Guaranty.
482	Chat briefly with Brent about this and let's finalize.
482	SS
483	I would suggest the following: "This is a Confirmation of an Option offered by ____________ to ENA and accepted by ENA pursuant to a telephone conversation on ___________ between the parties."
483	I don't know whether this is an omnibus or master but use language accordingly.
483	Call if you have questions.
483	ss
484	Sometimes I have brilliant ideas and this may not be one of them.
484	Also, it would be nice if Jennifer had a singing role but I know how kids can be so don't you worry.
484	I'm not implying that Zachary shouldn't sing (or take on an acting role as well) because that would be even better.
484	Or we could do a quartet.
484	Whatever.
484	But you ,dahling, are the centerpiece here because Mother and Daddy like you best.
484	So here are my preliminary thoughts for an Irving Houston off-Broadway play.
484	Naturally this is based on an Ada & Mike premise.
484	(1) This old suitcase (Daddy packed the Louis Vuitton without wheels a WEEK early but Mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close) (2) Lovely Linda (you remember Linda, don't you?) (3) Hi Debba, Hi Sara (what's the story, morning glory, etc. and of course this is the information hot-line and Mother's source of e-mail) I'm sure I'll have many more brilliant ideas over the weekend but I wanted you to be the first to share these ideas with me.
484	Sas Hope Phoenix was facializing and massaging (and fun to boot)
485	Do you recall the name of the Delaware business trust (which owned the oil and gas assets) that ECT executed a master with?
485	My memory is shot.
485	SS
486	I have reviewed the list that you gave to me this morning as well as the Australia trade.
486	I'm holding your files in my office.
486	I'm here for awhile.
486	Monday morning I have a conference call at 8:30 am that should not last more than one hour.
486	I have a few questions to ask.
486	Sara
487	Alan's response is correct.
487	You might check with Shari to see if she has made additonal inquires of Mexican counsel.
487	Sara Enron North America Corp.
488	I have an 8:30 am doctor's appointment on Wednesday, Oct. 27.
488	I'll leave the number with Kaye if you need anything.
488	Sara
489	Would you please get copies of all outstanding Transactions with this counterparty?
489	Thanks.
489	Sara
490	Please take a look and call.
490	SS
491	Hello there!
491	Long time no see!
491	Can you please give me a call (EXT. 35620) to discuss ESA in general?
491	I want to have Marie Heard available as well so that at least two people can keep track of your activity.
491	Thanks.
491	Sara ps My immediate inquiry is the entity hedging South Americal risk
492	Does Randy prefer a particular format?
492	Sara
493	On Friday, did you send the Tiger guaranty to Clem for execution?
493	SS
494	There are no outstanding issues as to the Tiger guaranty.
494	We need to have it executed.
494	Although we have not seen a redraft from the Tiger lawyers, Per seems to think that he'll be ablt to transact this week.
494	Thanks.
494	Sara
495	I will have to update this document weekly so I'd feel better if you updated, etc. I'll bring the info shortly and we can e-mail to Randy's assistant in Sao Paulo.
495	Thanks.
495	SS
496	We have not heard from the Tiger lawyers.
496	We have sent the Tiger guaranty to Enron Corp. for execution.
496	No other master agreements/guaranties for the other hedge fund entities have been drafted but each will look similar to the Tiger set of documents.
496	Sara
497	Thanks for the info.
497	I don't need anything further.
497	Also, thanks for your assistance last week and continued attention to our legal group.
497	Sara
498	John and Marc: Legal needs your help!
498	As you know, Cargill and ENA are frequent trading partners.
498	We have never put a swap master agreement in place.
498	In this day and age, we would be negligent to not execute the swap master agreement Cargill's legal department received a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement TWO MONTHS AGO.
498	I need your help to prompt the Cargill trader(s) to put some pressure on their legal department to negotiate the agreement with ENA.
498	The Cargill traders may call PHIL FANTLE.
498	Would you please make some calls and let me know who you speak with and when?
498	You can then give me a call or drop me an voice mail (Ext. 35620).
499	I have engaged South African counsel.
499	The response may take a few weeks but your transaction can proceed prior to that time.
499	However, I will need some time to refine our ISDA Schedule and learn about the counterparty.
499	Please keep me up-to-date.
499	Thanks.
499	Sara ps: I can talk
500	I think you were going to identify the Lagrasta deals after our meeting of last Tuesday (Oct. 19).
500	I've done a quick review (although I'm not as familiar with the deals as you may be) and think there are 9 deals: Aries Resources, LLC [Classic Resources Inc.] - dropped Formosa Hydrocarbons, Inc. - Breslau also concerned Hallwood Energy Corporation HS Resources Inc. Neumin Production Co. - Breslau also concerned Titan Resources L.P. TXU Energy Trading Company (?) Vastar Resources, Inc. Could you please verify.
500	Sara
501	Where in the Deseret confirmation do we request the legal opinion?
501	Did we send a sample?
501	Sara
502	Randy: Please forgive me for missing the call this morning.
502	I mistakenly thought that my 7:30 am doctor's appointment was tomorrow and not this morning.
502	Just a brief update to my resport of yesterday, Lynn, Brent and I are meeting this afternoon to discuss the Tozzini response and set plans for another trip to Sao Paulo to meet with the lawyers and refine the review.
502	I'll keep you briefed because I know that we're fast approaching year-end and Tozzini will be in a crunch.
502	We can discuss as the need arises.
502	Also, Lynn is preparing his synopsis regarding Don's recent inquiries about trading office locations.
502	Don's questions tie into the legal review of financial trading options in general but it's a good idea to address these up front.
502	Please call if you have any questions.
502	I promise to be back on board next week.
502	Regards.
502	Sara
503	See Pat's message below.
503	You may want to check with her.
503	Sara
504	Dr. Berman 713/523-4478 (in case you need me)
505	We need the revised confirm now.
505	I'd like to review it when you're done.
505	I sent the legal opinion draft to Deseret yesterday and they are sending their draft back shortly (I received a fax from them at 9:30 am today).
505	Thanks.
505	SS Mike: Do you want to see our legal opinion draft and/or Deseret's draft opinion to be sent shortly?
506	AFAC and Marcelo: We are in the process of reviewing the Comparative Chart and attached memorandum and will soon provide a list of remaining issues which Enron North America and South America would like to have addressed.
506	We are also attempting to identify specific types of transactions which may be required to hedge Enron risk in Brazil before 12/31/99.
506	For planning purposes, the "group" would like to meet with you in Sao Paulo during the week of November 28.
506	We are hoping that you may be able to accomodate us on November 30 (Tuesday), December 1 (Wednesday) or December 2 (Thursday).
506	Please let us hear from you.
506	Regards.
506	Sara
507	Can't promise 8:30 on the dot so how about 8:45 to 9:00?
508	A quick message in case you hadn't heard.
508	Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, legal can be reached at the Woodlands Conference Center at: 281-297-5130 (phone) 281-297-5132 and 5133 (fax)
509	I have registered for this one day class.
509	I was unable to secure a place in the "Structuring Power Transacations" class for Nov. 10 and 11 and I am waitlisted.
509	Sara
510	Congrats!
510	Come visit sometime.
510	SS
511	Do you have an answer to this question?
511	Should ENA continue to transact with EI?
511	Sara
512	How about tomorrow at 10:00 am?
513	Before my next meeting with the Tozzini lawyers this month, I would like to create a list of SPECIFIC products for managing Enron's Brazilian risk.
513	Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.
513	Please review this list, comment and identify any products required for trading prior to December 31, 1999.
513	Please let me hear from you if you would like to discuss any issues in particular.
513	Thanks.
513	Sara
514	I am still waiting verification from EI (which still exists as a legal entitiy).
514	It is likely that ENA will continue to deal directly with ENA (RMT) and that EI will handle the accounting internally.
514	I'll let you know as soon as I can.
514	Sara
515	Kaye: I think I returned this to you several weeks ago.
515	SS
516	What person(s) in London prepares credit for the English and Singapore financial transactions?
516	At some point in the not so distant future, the Houson and London credit departments need to speak in order that each understands the "philosophy" behind credit analysis for the omnibus and master transactions.
516	I look forward to hearing from you.
516	Regards.
516	Sara ps Congrats on your promotion!
516	I didn't have a chance to speak with you after the offsite to shake your hand.
516	Hope you enjoyed your weekend in Houston.
517	I have you on my calendar for 2 pm on Thursday.
517	Sara
518	I have requested Deseret's bylaws from David Crabtree.
518	Our Utah counsel will review and call tomorrow.
518	Let me know if you have any other questions.
518	Sara
519	Attached are the Catalytica annexes and economic terms.
519	Please let me know if you have any comments.
519	Sara
520	Please prepare an amendment to this master agreement which deletes reference to the "pari passu" language.
520	Thanks.
520	Sara
521	I received the bylaws this morning and forwarded them to Utah counsel (who is in NY).
521	Left 2 messages with his office.
521	Have not heard from him.
521	I'll call again.
521	SS
522	seminars: (1) 11/10 and 11/11 - Structuring Power Transactions (no longer wait listed) (2) 11/16 - Electric Business Understanding (4) I would like to take 12/10 as a vacation day Thanks.
522	Sara
523	I would like to take this as a vacation day.
523	Are there any conflicts?
523	Thanks.
523	Sara
524	Please decide who should be assigned to this counterparty and add to Lotus Notes.
524	It's a Top Ten and we need to follow up.
524	Thanks.
524	Sara
525	Here's a heads up (if you weren't aware) of a new brokerage account requested by a NEW entity: Enron India GDR Holding Ltd. I'm tracking down the details.
525	SS
526	Marcelo: Have you had a chance to speak with AFAC about the week of November 28?
526	Please let me hear from you soon.
526	Regards.
526	Sara
527	FYI and handling.
527	Sara
528	You were going to send a structure diagram?
529	Did you talk to these guys?
530	Thank you for the e-mail.
530	I tried to contact you on your mobile several times in the last few minutes but I cannot get through.
530	Is there anyone besides Lauren who can help us in her absence?
530	I understand the GDRs were purchased and the account must be opened.
530	We cannot do anything without background documentation.
530	Also, we cannot find any information about the purchaser on the Enron corporate workbook.
530	Do you have a list of officers/directors?
530	You can call me at 713/853-5620.
530	Regards.
530	Sara
531	I'd like to schedule a time to meet with AFAC and Marcelo during the week of November 28 in Sao Paulo.
531	Let me know ASAP if you have a preferance.
531	I suggest we shoot for Tuesday (in case we have follow up issues).
531	Thanks.
531	Sara
532	Please call.
532	Brent and I missed you this morning.
532	Here's the extent of what I was able to find out.
532	We called Andrea Bertone and left word.
532	I think she's calling Brent (as I was on a conference call when she rang back).
532	Pat Cini will join our Friday morning meetings.
532	Is Michael Herman taking over Brazil financial?
532	SS
533	Andrea: Would you please see that I am added to circulation of the deal transaction list (containing trading deals)?
533	Thanks.
533	Sara
534	I spoke with Robert Nuernberg (inhouse legal) who acknowledged that company has authority to trade financially.
534	ENA will send ISDA master to company which will also offer up new resolution or legal opinion.
534	We can do a one-month deal and book on our short form omnibus.
534	Call if you have any questions.
534	Sara
535	Can you check on this and send to Brent?
535	Thanks.
535	SS
536	FYI
537	Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.
537	It still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending their guaranty.
537	Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and ENA?
537	At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.
538	If the guaranty is capped at $15million and payment demands are made by HPL and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.
538	Should the payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or do we care?
538	I hope this helps.
538	SS
539	AFAC and Marcelo: Thank you for the message.
539	We would suggest Tuesday, November 30 at Enron's offices.
539	Is 9 am convenient for you?
539	Please advise.
539	Regards.
539	Sara
540	Yes, and I assume that Sean still has the Annexes previously prepared.
540	SS
541	We have scheduled a meeting with Antonio Felix and Marcelo on Tuesday, November 30 at 9 am (Brazil time) in Sao Paulo.
541	The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss the Tozzini memorandum of October 19, address unanswered questions and identify issues for further research.
541	We are attempting to identify specific financial products for immediate trading.
541	For those of you in Houston who would like to participate, please let me know and we can either revise the meeting time or conference you in later in the meeting.
541	Please confirm your attendance as soon as possible.
541	Thanks.
541	Sara
542	Please forward to Elizabeth and me.
543	Lauren Hagerty is in Houston today and will provide us with the necessary documentation for opening of the account.
543	We will advise when the information is received.
543	Thanks.
543	Sara
544	Before I send the draft, please let me know the type of customer (general corporate, utility, municipal, etc.).
544	Thanks.
544	Sara
545	ENA sent a Notice of Termination letter to Southern on November 1, 1999 and set that date as the Early Termination Date.
545	There is only one existing Transaction: a second quarter 2000 collar.
545	We have obtained a third party quotation for the value of the call (at $.928) which when multiplied by the total notional and days, is equivalent to $25,334.40.
545	Please let me know if you have any comments to the letter.
545	Lisa: Is there a protocol for a non-lawyer to sign the calculation notice letter?
545	Should it come from settlements which would be tracking any payments (if ever received in whole or part)?
545	Thanks.
545	Sara
546	Fred: I am continuing to update your list based upon legal/credit meetings and requests for master agreements.
546	If you have priorities, please let me or Susan Flynn know.
546	Sara
547	Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & Cromwell be retained.
547	With respect to interest by the CFTC in the proposed transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as well?
547	Makes sense to me.
547	Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?
547	Sara
548	I would like to schedule the last week of 1999, Dec. 27 - Dec. 30, as vacation.
548	No one else has selected those dates.
548	Please let me know if this is a problem.
548	Thanks.
548	Sara
549	Please assign.
549	This is an Annex A for a general corporate.
549	An Annex B should be attached.
549	Both Annexes should read SAMPLE or DRAFT with our exclusionary language.
549	Obviously the Annex B will not have anything on it other than reference to credit determination.
549	Please e-mail today to John Malowney.
549	Thanks.
549	SS and call if you have questions.
550	We'll have to put a master in place.
550	SS
551	How about this Friday, Nov. 12 at 2 pm?
551	Sara
552	Please schedule for 1-hour.
552	Thanks.
552	Also, please add Shari to the "utility meeting" with Mark and Carol.
552	Is a conference room available?

553	Could we possibly RESCHEDULE the time for 2 pm (Sao Paulo) time?
553	There is currently a four (4) hour time difference with Houston and we will need to conference in several people.
553	Thanks.
553	Sara
554	I hope you can help Carol out before our phone call in the morning.
554	I have tried Patricia Aufranc twice but there is no answer.
554	If you could reach her early in the morning to resolve, I would be most appreciative.
554	You can discuss with me in the morning.
554	Thanks.
554	Sara

558	I will call you after lunch to discuss Total.
558	The Marval firm in B.A.
558	is ENA's outside legal counsel for derivatives advice.
558	ENA lawyers hire and speak with ENA's outside counsel.
558	I have spoken with our outside counsel on derivatives issues in Argentina.
558	I will discuss this further with you when you and I have our conversation.
558	Sara
559	FYI - John's only issue was "inhouse" vs "outside" counsel legal opinion.
559	And he apologized profusely.
559	No harm done.
559	Sounds like you did a good job.
559	Have a great weekend.
559	Sara
560	You were going to follow up with these counterparties by the next legal/credit meeting.
561	We are sending this out in draft form until Scott Neal (our "Argentina" trader) has confirmed the terms of the deal with EDEN.
561	The trade date will probably be set towards the end of next week.
561	Sara
562	I have an early morning appointment on Tuesday and will be unable to join the phone conference.
562	I don't have anything new to report.
562	I have rescheduled the meeting with Tozzini in ESA's offices for Tuesday, Nov. 30 at 2 pm in order to conference in the Houston attendees.
562	We will not require video conferencing (but thanks for the offer).
562	Also, Lynn A. will have a final assessment of tax issues relating to an Argentine trading office location and we will try to meet with D. Black and/ or Michael G. Lynn will provide with his analysis beforehand.
562	Let me know if you have any questions.
562	Sara
563	Please assign.
563	Any questions, ask me.
563	Thanks.
563	Sara
564	Just a reminder.
564	I will be in a seminar tomorrow.
564	Sara
565	I have a 9 am doctor's appointment on Wednesday.
565	Sara
566	Per my voice mail.
566	Let me know what you think.
566	SS
567	Hey Sam, that has to be one of the "cheeriest" cards I've ever received.
567	Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?).
567	Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?
567	I remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably remember the stripper).
567	I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe and I can send you a holiday card.
567	Are you a bi-city resident?
567	Do you still own Corky's?
567	Do you have a different venture(s)?
567	How is Mr. Casey?
567	How are Helen and Beverly?
567	Do you see them often?
567	Do you love Atlanta?
567	You know that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of consciousness.
567	I hope this makes sense.
567	Sara P.S.
567	Ain't life grand?
568	Martin: Sorry for the log jam but I always thought that the law firm was the best idea.
568	Call if you need assistance.
568	Sara
569	Let's have this signed and fax per below.
569	Thanks.
569	SS
570	I've been thinking about your query and in the interim, I find that David is very conscientious and does not let outstanding issues linger.
570	He also seems quite eager to learn.
570	As I continue to work with him, I am glad to keep you updated if you remind me periodically.
570	Sara
571	Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming along.
571	When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA?
571	Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you in any way.
571	I understand that our respective traders are discussing a transaction.
571	You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.
571	Thanks.
571	Sara
572	Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc. If we cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable (i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).
572	We definitely need to review certified copies of the counterparty's charter, enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of which we always provide to the counterparty).
572	It's best to execute the ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.
572	Call if you need further help.
572	Sara Enron North America Corp.
573	I thought we sent it but I'll have Marie Heard email a copy right away.
573	SS
574	Thanks for remembering me (even though I FORGOT to send you birthday wishes last month).
574	It doesn't seem like a year, does it?
574	Hope you're doing great and your family is well.
574	How's the HOUSE OF THE CENTURY coming along?
574	I recall looking at the plans just "yesterday".
574	Stay well (and young).
574	Sara
575	Attached is the latest "redraft" of guidelines based upon my conversation with Brent (who has not yet seen the attachment).
575	Let's discuss these tomorrow.
575	I'll conference you at 9 am.
575	Thanks.
575	Sara Lynn: I'll forward separately Brent's proposed paragraph for the Houston trader.
576	Here's Brent's other paragraph.
577	Per our conversation.
577	Sara
578	Yes, I'll get to it today.
578	I've already spoken with Jared.
578	SS
579	Please!
579	Sara
580	Hi Christian!
580	I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of negative pricing on the west desk.
580	I'm getting a differenct response on the east desk.
580	Although my interest is financial trading, you may have experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).
580	In the past on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed to be "0" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).
580	The east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.
580	Please call me to discuss.
580	I'd really appreciate it.
580	Sara
581	Can you recall if the trades (west desk) were swaps or puts?
581	SS ps I'm still trying to resolve
582	no
583	Marie: Wisconsin's lawyer is out of the office until Nov. 29.
583	Would you please follow up with respect to the ISDA which we sent to him on Nov. 5?
583	I left your name and phone number on his voice mail.
583	Cary is interested in pursuing this counterparty.
583	Thanks.
583	Sara
584	Can we conference on Tuesday, November 23?
584	Anytime after 10:30 am CST works.
584	Or anytime on Wednesday, November 24 before 3pm CST.
584	Thanks.
584	Sara
585	FYI - I called in for the meeting this morning but no one else ever connected.
585	Sorry.
585	I have nothing new to report.
585	I'll be in S.P. next week for a few days.
585	I'll try to get on your calendar.
585	Thanks.
585	Sara P. S. Happy Thanksgiving!
586	Please explain or handle.
586	thanks.
586	SS
587	consider it cancelled.

588	Hello AFAC and Marcelo: Attached is a recent "short list" of possible products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.
588	The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels frequently to Brazil.
588	Bruce will join us by telephone next week.
588	My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's list.
588	Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, as will Andrea Bertone.
588	We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from Houston.
588	This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 29.
588	I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.
588	I'm looking forward to our meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.
588	See you both soon.
588	Regards.
588	Sara
589	The Tozzini lawyers will meet with us to discuss prior memoranda and products for trading.
589	For those in Houston who wish to be conferenced in, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis in Houston (X35968) who will make arrangements.
589	Thanks.
589	Sara
590	Carol: Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus Notes entry).
590	Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.
590	Tanya knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is unacceptable so CP has a MAC).
590	We expect their outside counsel to have some comments which we haven't yet seen.
590	Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand delay).
590	Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).
590	Marie has the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.
590	Our discussion today was general.
590	Thanks for your help.
590	Sara
591	Per my voice mail!
591	Debra please follow up.
591	Call Marie if you have any questions.
591	Sara
592	I'll be back in the office on Friday, Dec. 3.
592	Kaye Ellis can reach me in the Sao Paulo office.
592	thanks.
592	SS
593	Chris and Tracy: I will be in the Sao Paulo office most of this week.
593	You can reach me there (check with my assistant Kaye Ellis) or you can call Marie (X33907) and she will make certain that a lawyer is available to help you.
593	Thanks.
593	Sara Marie: Please assist Chris and Tracy as required.
593	Thanks.
593	Sara
594	Kaye: did you handle?
594	Thanks.
594	Sara
595	I'll be in Sao Paulo this week.
595	You still didn't send me a mailing address.
596	Attached is my feedback.
596	Sara Cullen Duke @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
597	Thanks for the help.
597	Could you please call Chris?
597	Sara
598	I think that Carol may have looked at this several months ago.
598	Isn't this related to the request of Jean Mhra?
598	Enron North America Corp.
599	Please revise now.
599	Thanks.
599	SS
600	Please let me know if you never received.
600	I had this hand delivered to you on Friday.
600	ss
601	Is this the deal we lost?
601	Please tell me what you know.
601	ss p.s.
601	Welcome back.
602	The disappearance of a price index is a "Market Disruption Event" discussed in Section 7 of Annex A to the confirmation.
602	Unless an "Alternative Floating Price Source" is described in the confirmation, the Floating Price on the first available Trading Day (without a disruption) is utilized if the disruption does not exceed three Business Days; otherwise, the price is "determined in good faith by Company, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."
602	At the moment, your confirm does not identify alternative pricing.
603	There are a few credit issues here.
603	I have a 9:30 am call with Cargill.
603	SS
604	I just sent a fax to Chip Rainey.
604	No attachments.
604	Thanks.
604	SS
605	FYI
606	El Paso is a "high volume" CP with an existing ECT Master.
606	Marie, there is a 9/1/99 note in Lotus Notes that the CP to email its form of Schedule.
606	What have we received?
606	Shouldn't we be pushing this ISDA?
606	Can someone prepare credit?
607	This is a "high volume" counterparty.
607	Shouldn't we be pursuing an ISDA to replace the existing ECT Master?
607	Susan, your last entry was 3/9/99.
607	SS
608	This is a "high volume" trading counterparty.
608	Shouldn't we negotiate an ISDA to replace the existing master?
608	SS
609	Jeff: I thought we should update the situation particularly in light of the problems that Willie runs up against.
609	Can you give me a call and let's discuss.
609	Thanks.
609	Sara
610	The east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price language for some of the power pools.
610	The west desk wants "negative prices" to be averaged in as "zeroes"; the east desk wants to average in all prices "positive or negative".
610	I'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish.
610	I can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach (in each instance ENA may take either side of the deal).
610	The confirm desk will have to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing language.
610	I don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue.
610	What do you think?
610	Sara
611	Are we still on for a lunch at the Big G tomorrow?
611	I'm flying to NO in the morning.
611	Your voice mail didn't pick up on your phone this morning (504/898-1909).
611	Please call and I'll even try you again.
611	Sara
612	attached is the form.
612	no premium.
612	Also, we need to use that introductory paragraph about "mutual promises, etc,"
613	I will be out of the office tomorrow.
613	Please have the call if you think it necessary.
613	Thanks.
613	Sara
614	I'm checking into to provide help.
614	SS
615	Per my voice mail.
615	Also, for YOUR use, I am attaching a "form" of gas tolling agreement.
615	Brent also has a "confirmation" related to a master.
615	Let me know if you've already handled.
615	Thanks.
615	SS
616	Per David's request, I'm attaching a (very old) form from Houston, not often used here anymore.
616	I'm not sending this directly to David (if only to avoid "form shopping").
616	Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
616	Thanks.
616	Sara
617	I just spoke with Lawyer Burlingame and we're on for lunch.
617	My flight arrives at 10:45 and I'll drop off my bag and head for Galatoire's.
617	Look forward to seeing you.
617	ss P.S.
617	My dad would like to treat us to lunch using "his waiter" who I think is named Michael.
618	In my absence on Friday, Dec. 10, please contact Susan Flynn (X30975) with any questions.
618	Sara
619	This is FYI only since I'll be out tomorrow.
619	I have never spoken with Bruce.
619	Nothing will happen tomorrow.
619	Thanks.
619	Sara
620	Bruce: I'm out of the office tomorrow but will be back Monday.
620	Let's talk then please.
620	Sara
621	Doug: Per our conversation, will you please forward to me and Sami a copy of the recent tolling agreement?
621	Thanks.
621	Sara
622	Mark and I met with Mark Haedicke regarding utilities and the need for a legal opinion from the utility counterparty.
622	We have agreed with Mark as follows: 1.
622	Our negotiations with investor owned utilities should be based upon our standard ISDA Schedule (ISDA Multicurrency Agreement) AND including the "Additional Termination Event".
622	Neither party should be required to provide a legal opinion.
622	2.
622	Investor owned utilites will be approved for online trading from a legal viewpoint.
622	The extra "Additional Termination Event" paragraph is not currently included in the GTC's but COULD be incorporated if there is a revision to the online agreement.
622	3.
622	Our position with respect to municipals/municipal owned utilities, federal/state/local owned utilities and cooperatives remains unchanged.
622	We should still utilize and update the "municipal ISDA" form, and, require a legal opinion from the counterparty.
622	In that regard, Susan Flynn has been working on an "omnibus" format for an electric co-op (Deseret Generation and Transmission Co-operative), an earlier version of which could be used as a template for a municipal omnibus confirmation.
623	FYI - just in case.
623	SS
624	I have no changes from last week.
624	Sara
625	Call me anytime today.
625	713/853-5620.
625	Thanks.
625	Sara
626	Good to hear from you!!!
626	I'm looking forward to hearing about your stay in Brazil.
626	Are you back in Houston?
626	Let's have lunch.
626	Sorry about the guide.
626	It sounds like a larger, well established hotel will have the edge on tourism information.
627	ENA booked a July-August, 2000 deal with this counterparty.
627	Is this company a municipal?
627	Have you agreed to governing law and arbitration?
627	SS
628	I think it's the first doc.
628	Check the "Re" for the deal number.
628	Thanks.
628	Sara
629	Per my voice mail, you can see the floating price index language (power and gas) that I need.
629	Please email or fax so that I can insert it into my draft confirm.
629	Thanks.
629	Sara
630	please print these for me.
630	thanks.
630	ss
631	Danny: I did not recieve new documents last night.
631	When can I expect something?
631	Sara
632	I wanted to sent you a holiday card but, alas, the mysterious Sam has no address.
632	I guess I could send it to your lessee in the Big Easy (remember, the doctor living in the marina) but he may not appreciate the beauty of the card.
632	Please email your address.
632	Hope you had a "Happy Chanukah".
632	I was in BR to celebrate with my family - Jennifer is 15 and Zachary will be 13 on January 1.
632	My parents are slowing down but Deb and Steve are not.
632	Deb ordered some brisket and latkes from the 2nd Ave.
632	deli in NY and the food was awful.
632	Sara
633	I haven't heard anything further about this deal.
633	Attached is a framework for future revision.
633	SS
634	yes
635	Attached is a draft of a swaption based upon the term sheet reviewed the other day.
635	Elizabeth has not reviewed yet and I still have some lingering questions.
635	ss
636	This is scheduled to close on Friday (don't know what time).
636	It's Gareth's deal.
636	Enron Corp. is swap CP with a trust.
636	Don't know who is signing for Enron Corp. Please C me to discuss and raise logistical issues.
636	Thanx.
636	SS
637	FYI
638	Are you OK with this deal?
638	I may have a few questions.
638	SS
639	I don't know who's working on this deal, so I'm forwarding docs to you all.
639	Tax reps look ok to me.
639	[see Total Return Swap Confirmation - Sec.
639	3.2; Schedule - Part 5(l) and requirement that swap counterparty which is Enron Corp. deliver IRS 'Forms 1001 or 4224].
639	Please leave me voice mail or email.
639	Thanks.
639	Sara ps.
639	this closes Friday morning
640	Please confirm the Enron Corp. account for the swap: Citibank
641	I think that this transaction is called "Project Moosehead".
641	I have a meeting on it this morning.
641	Please comment to the draft I sent to you yesterday.
641	I don't know if the structure works.
641	I couldn't decide upon the format; it also looks like a cap.
641	Thanks.
641	SS
642	RECAP: This is Project Moosehead.
642	After the meeting, we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.
642	The Fixed Price is the premium.
642	The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).
642	We'll need to revise today to send in the morning.
642	CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.".
642	Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA Master for the deal.
642	There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in the other direction).
642	Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal.
642	Could you begin revising?
642	Also, do the calculations work?
642	Please feel free to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on.
642	SS
643	Let's cancel.
643	OK?
644	I'll send you a brief comparison of the ERMS/Merrill ISDA from 1992 with ENA's typical ISDA used in 1999 by the morning.
644	Am currently working to produce the confirm format.
644	SS
645	Please make sure that I am on the distribution list for ALL documentation.
645	I only have the swap confirm/schedule.
645	Thanks.
645	Sara
646	Attached is a brief comparison of differences.

651	Thanks.

653	The ISDA Schedule calls for the delivery of IRS Form 1001.
654	I will not be able to make the call tomorrow.
654	Sara
655	This is the deal that Susan F. worked on on Friday.
655	I'll forward the Schedule to you.
655	No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should make the change and email the parties on Susan's email so that everyone knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.
655	ss
656	Here's the message I just referneced.
656	ss
657	Lynn: Weren't you going to take a look at the Trader Guidelines for Argentina?

658	Could you please print.
658	ss
659	Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).
659	I haven't heard any details.
659	It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will happen in the next few days.
659	FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas until next year.
659	SS
660	The account number in the confirmation is correct.
660	Please add "without duplication" language to the Floating Amount calculation.

665	With respect to Part 2, Tax Reps and Part 5(l) deletion, the Enron Corp. tax group is fine with the changes (although these are not necessary).
665	Also, Enron will deliver forms as Barclays wishes.
665	Let me know if you have any questions.

667	Periods are from 12/25-12/31, January, 2/1-2/22.
667	3.
667	Is this a 24-hour index or is it limited to peak hours as defined by I left a message for Joe Hunter (confirmation desk - Ext. 33316) to be prepared for this Transaction.
667	Brent: would you please verify the Floating Price?
667	Thanks.
668	Just to be certain that the EES entity that might enter into the swap is eligible, you should verify that it (1) has total assets in excess of $10 million or (2) has a net worth of $1 million and enters into the swap agreement in connection with the conduct of its business or to manage the risk of an asset or liability owned or incurred in the conduct of its business or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its business.
669	I have been unable to reach Ana Sonia by phone as she has not returned to the office and has not returned my telephone calls.
669	So, we are preparing execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.
669	We will faand Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax thesignature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and whenwe can expect their opinion of counsel.
669	I will also explain this to Ana Sonia by separate fax.
669	I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this tohim.
669	Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am outnext week as well).
669	However, Marie Heard will help out next week.
669	Let meknow if you have any questions.
669	Sara
670	Automatic Termination Provision: If the legal opinion required to be delivered by Counterparty pursuant to Part 3 of the Schedule to the Agreement is not delivered to ENA by December 29, 1999, then this Transaction shall automatically terminate on December 29, 1999 without further action or payment required by either party.
671	I did speak with Ana Soria.
671	Her only concern was the legal opinion.
671	I faxed her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business on December 29.
671	I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.
671	Also, Joe Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the confirmation.
671	Have a happy holiday.
671	Sara
672	Pending execution of a master agreement, Amoco transactions continue to be documented under the omnibus.
672	Willie has brought to my attention three issues which continue to be raised by Amoco: 1.
672	Procedures for entering into Transactions: deletion of response within 2 Business Days after receipt of confirmation and failure to respond as conclusive evidence of Transaction 2.
672	Setoff: there doesn't seem to be an "Affliliate" issue but I'm not certain of their comment to setoff applicable against a "derivative amount" (are they attempting to prevent setoff against physical amounts owing? or only trying to clarify that unpaid "derivative amounts" can be setoff against other amounts due?) 3.
672	Choice of law: change to NY I thought you could address these issues in your negotiations and let Willie know how to handle.
672	I've left confirm in your office.
672	Thanks.
672	Sara
673	I should be in immediately after my 8:30 am appointment.

693	Follow up from Brent -
694	Is anyone interested in joining me for Portuguese lessons?
694	Do you know anyone else who might be interested as well?
694	Sara
695	ENA has been negotiating an ISDA with Statoil.
695	I was advised by Chuck O'Brien this morning that Statoil also trades with ECTRIC and that he received an omnibus confirm from ECTRIC this morning.
695	Statoil will not sign the omnibus but would like to put an ISDA in place with ECTRIC and have the trade subject to that ISDA.
695	ENA should finalize its ISDA soon.
695	Would ECTRIC like to duplicate?
695	Happy New Year!
695	Sara
696	I hear that a binding agreement and/or PPA was signed with MOEMA for a 10-year transaction.
696	Do you have an English version of the MOU or PPA?
696	Details?
696	Thanks.
696	Sara
697	Pat: Do we need to talk?
698	Here's the confirm
699	Here's the attached termsheet
700	FYI: Enron South America has requested a new account for CIESA deal.

703	I'm still reviewing the ISDA but I asked Marie to prepare an omnibus to send Thurs.
703	morning.
703	SS
704	Just to be on the safe side, are you familiar with this and/or should I call Rick if we have questions?
704	A second email to follow.
704	Thanks.
704	SS
705	the second email
706	FYI
707	Marie is not in the office today; your direct contact should be Susan Bailey I spoke earlier with Rick Hopkinson who indicated that the account will probably be for the benefit of EPCA.
707	We need to verify a few details (account party, purpose, resolutions, authorized trader list, etc.).
707	Also, will the broker be Morgan?
707	Nancy, since you will be working on the authorizations, please keep in mind that Ted Murphy will limit authorized traders to the Houston equity traders(and perhaps Bruce) for control purposes.
707	I believe we had to change the Enron Brazil Power Holding XII Ltd. resolutions in that regard.
707	I'll verify.
707	Susan and I will wait to hear from one of you in Sao Paulo.
707	I called about 10 minutes ago and no one was available.
707	Thanks.
707	Sara
708	Thanks for the tax article.
708	It's the published version of the one I sent to you in September, 99.
708	Also, you were going to select a date at the end of January when we could teleconference to discuss Argentine issues, and, you were going to send to me the term sheet in use in Argentina.
708	Thanks.
708	Sara
709	Please let me know what you think so that Nancy can forward to lawyers.
709	ss
710	I just wanted to touch base with you about efforts to keep good lines of communication between B.A.
710	and Houston about trading activity in Argentina and Brazil (both financial and physical).
710	I participate in Randy's weekly conference calls and Brent tells me that you have now undertaken that role in B.A.
710	As you know, sometimes proposals and deals "slip through the cracks" and Houston is taken by surprise.
710	We want to remain current and proactive.
710	Please feel free to leave me an email or voice mail when you learn of any relevant activitiy.
710	I , in turn, communicate directly with credit in Houston (Pat Cini or Rod Nelson) and tax in Houston (Lynn Aven or Rick Hopkinson or Michael Herman).
710	If you ever feel the need for a conference call, I'm always available and I'm sure credit and tax would be glad to join.
710	Also, I hold a weekly Friday conference call with Brent and Lynn to discuss current trading issues in Argentina and Brazil.
710	Thanks.
710	Sara
711	Should we invite one of the tax lawyers to our weekly meeting to discuss new forms and answer any tax questions?
711	ss
712	I am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically (what are we able to negotiate) and legally (what do we really need in our Schedule).
712	I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties.
712	ENA's form of "municipal" Schedule ("the ENA Schedule") was essentially taken from the 1992 ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule ("the ISDA Schedule").
712	In addition to other provisions, the ISDA Schedule (1) adds reps designed to avoid "an Orange County" type meltdown and (2) incorporates the concept of "Incipient Illegality" (which occurs before the Termination Event of Illegality).
712	The "Incipient Illegality" concept is used in Section 2(a)(iii) (obligations) as well as the Section 3 (reps) of the ISDA Schedule: the concept is added to the Section 3(b) rep ("..absence of Event of Default, Potential Event of Default, Incipient Illegality...), and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence. Interestingly enough, the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3(b) rep change. I think we need to add this change to ENA's Schedule. With respect to IOUs, we need to clarify our position on "Regulatory Development" (which is actually a watered-down "Incipient Illegality" concept). If such an event occurs, ENA should be advised of the event (Notice). But, does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at mid-market ("Additional Termination Event") or simply to have this event included as part of a Section 3(b) rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA's side of the curve (for breach of the Section 3(b) rep)? I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the "Notice" provision can be difficult. Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough. Arguing for a Section 3(b) change may be easier (and would mirror the municipal format). I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development (which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty). Thus, I recommend that for IOUs, we add a notice provision and Section 3(b) rep change incorporating our latest definition of "Regulatory Development."
712	But we really have to negotiate for this protection. Otherwise, why bother to include this additional language? What do you think?
713	I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the following comments: (1) I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities.
713	However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for obvious errors.
713	(However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research on our behalf. I'll discuss with him).
713	(2) I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on authority/regulatory issues.
713	In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than outside counsel's domicile.
713	(3) The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to absence of litigation.
713	This rep drags in governmental bodies and all agencies (hence, a state PUC).
713	Thus, online parties will rep as to authority to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC issues.
713	(Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a "Regulatory Development" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we may also have a Termination Event under our current format).
714	Would someone please provide me with an explanation of the purpose of this account.
714	Thanks.
714	Sara
715	Please see attached.
715	Thanks.
715	Sara
716	I hope Bruce's explanation is sufficient!
716	Please call me if you have any other questions.
716	Thanks.
716	Sara
717	I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already addressed, such as: Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?
717	Carol mentioned that she could finalize this project.
717	Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical mail each day?
717	What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?
717	What about existing files?
717	Top Tens (Swiss Re)?
717	Any ISDA comparisons could be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.
717	Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?
717	Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?
717	Should Susan Bailey handle per Carol's suggestion?
717	I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding of how to handle the situation.
717	Thanks.
717	Sara
718	Can you email a copy of the "Loan and Security Agreement" to me at sshackl@enron.com?
718	I can then redline suggested changes to your agreement.
718	Thanks.

719	I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.
719	Will advise when I hear back.
719	SS
720	Are the certificate(s) to be issued by BONY restricted or common?
720	(sounds like restricted and to be issued in the name of PEP) I think that we can lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.
720	Are we headed in the same direction here?
720	SS
721	You'll need this draft for later use.

722	Morgan Stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to accounts: 1.
722	The name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate holder.
722	2.
722	An account holding only a certificate(s) is subject to a minimum equity requirement of USD 500,000.
722	As the certificate holder is the Brazilian company PEP, the broker will require additonal equity.
722	I am still awaiting a broker response as to whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate(s) in the existing (Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII) account.
722	Alternatively, the certificate(s) can be held in the Enron Corp. vault.
722	Robert, when do you need to respond to BONY?
723	Could someone please follow up on the status of this CP.
723	Thanks.
723	Sara
724	I would like to take the following days in February as vacation days: February 3,4,18 Please let me know if this presents a conflict.

726	Gosh, I had totally forgotten!!
726	That Friday makes for a long President's Day weekend which I was trying to arrange.
726	Will this lunch be too difficult to reschedule?
726	Just let me know.
726	Thanks.
726	Sara P.S.
726	Are you feeling better?
726	You missed our group meeting.
726	I asked what I thought was an innocent question about the legal survey database since it was related to part of our discussion.
726	BIG MISTAKE.
726	Tana was explosive.
726	Sorry you missed it.
727	McISDA is sprouting Golden Arches.
727	Although we have a serious legal issue, I think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and will overcome the problem.
727	Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit Support Annex and will call Tanya (or already has called her).
727	Call me and I'll give you the scoop.

729	I have been receiving the "Enron International Southern Cone" list of projects (updated weekly) for the B.A.
729	office for quite some time.
729	As you know, it covers trading Projects and Claims/Litigation/Regulatory.
729	Is there a similar list prepared for projects originating in Brazil?
729	I would like to recieve such a list as would the parties copied above.
729	Please let me know.
729	Regards.

730	We are currently updating our database of brokerage agreements for Ted Murphy.
730	We only show two (2) executed agreements for ECTRIC and/or UK SPVs.
730	These include agreements that ECTRIC has with Fimat Futures UK Limited and Paribas Futures, Inc. If other such agreements have been executed, would you please advise and send copies to Houston.
730	Ted will now keep a duplicate set of agreements.
730	Also, would any other European locations have executed brokerage or futures agreements?
730	If you have any questions, please call.
730	Regards.
730	Sara
731	ENA can confirm the transaction on our "omnibus confirmation" with one or two minor changes (Joe: please call me).
731	Also, ENA sent a draft ISDA Master Agreement to Puget Sound Energy on 3/9/99.
731	If you anticipate more financial trading, please let me know as we should pursue execution of the ISDA Master Agreement.
731	Thanks.

733	Mark: have you spoken with Brent or the Marval firm about this?
733	Please call me when you have a chance.
733	Thanks.

734	Have you and Mark ever discussed this?
734	Have you spoken with Marval?

737	I have two (2) tickets for "Wit" playing at the Alley Theatre for Friday, Feb. 11 (8 pm, Sec. 4, Row G).
737	Let me know if you are interested.
737	No charge.
737	Sara
738	Let's enter into the database.
738	I'll meet with you shortly to discuss further.
738	Thanks.

739	Attached is a redline based upon the document generated by you.
739	I'm sure there will be many items for discussion and I look forward to hearing from you.
739	Regards.
739	Sara
740	Happy New Year!
740	I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine commercial group.
740	They have told me the following: (1) An association known as the "Argentine Association of Derivatives" has developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for use in the near term.
740	It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.
740	It is a "short" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex).
740	(2) This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.
740	Are you involved in this effort?
740	Is ISDA involved?
740	Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing.
740	If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions.
740	I look forward to hearing from you.
740	Regards.
740	Sara
741	Let's verify that this is an IOU.
741	The Master should be sent to the attention of Dave Brown and you should advise Cary of when it was sent to the customer.
741	He may want a copy.
741	ps Remind me to give you both copies of Tana's utility analysis.
741	Also, Marie, let's talk about the utility language and circulate for comment.
742	Happy New Year!
742	Just wondering if you had an opportunity to review the CSA and comment.
742	Drop me a line or call 713/853-5620.
742	Thanks.
742	Sara
743	I would like to pursue with Marval.
743	Should we meet to discuss?
743	Sara
744	Joe Hunter no longer handles financial power.
744	Please refer to names below.
744	Thanks.
744	Sara
745	Brent: Gabby Aguilar(?) from BA has requested Lynn for an "immediate white paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what else) and financial trading in Argentina.
745	What phone call on Thursday were you referring to on your voice mail?
745	I'll try to call you in about an hour.
745	Sara
746	I still need to revise the agreement for the bank/broker.
746	I need the exact name of the lender and an addressee.
746	Smith Barney was sent to Steve Piasio.
746	Thanks.
746	Sara
747	Here's my goof!
747	Give me a call.
747	Sara
748	Lynn will come to my office at 9 am.
748	Julian will try to be here too but he has an 8am meeting and may be late.
748	I can call you if you like, but just let me know which number.
748	SS P.S.
748	Shall I just schedule a call with you and Mark?
749	Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.
749	To my knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 doesn't mention Mark).
749	So, I'm totally confused.
749	If we are going to discuss the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.
749	If you want to cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and advise Lynn and Julian).
749	Thanks.
750	Let me know if you have comments or want to discuss further.
750	P.S.
750	to Rod: We need to talk about Basin
751	I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been lifted by the CA PUC.
751	I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc. and you can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.
751	Thus I am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.
751	I will also inquire about SDG&E's online objectives.
751	SS
752	I'm available as well.
752	Sara
753	Of course.
753	Just let me know what deadline you would like.
753	SS
754	I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.
754	You may want to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.
754	SS
755	That will be fine.
755	Sara
756	Holly Krebbs just did a deal with these guys (short form) but they want to negotiate an ISDA.
756	We need to send an updated form to them.
756	Will there be any credit changes?
757	Central Puerto has been unresponsive to Marie's requests for original documents.
757	Can someone please contact Marie and help us speak with the counterparty?
757	Thanks.
757	Sara
758	We will need to update this ISDA on our new, revised, fantastic format!!!
758	I'll have to find out who to send it to.
758	SS
759	FYI - Brent please call.
759	Sounds like we ought to accelerate our plan.
759	SS
760	Could this be an alternative to our recording issue?
761	Thanks.
761	SS
762	Attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ENA of existing brokerage and futures accounts.
762	I thought these should be sent to the general counsel and CFO/Treasurer of each company.
762	Please let me know your comments, frequency of review, whether any other group should monitor, etc. Each attached Exhibit will contain only a list of accounts.
762	I have not included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information you consider relevant.
762	Remember, the only other "brokerage account matrix" which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and Enron companies.
762	Thanks.
763	In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."
763	Arguably it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date).
763	My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.
763	Can you recall?
764	Can we schedule a short call on Tuesday to discuss the local Argentine derivatives issue?
764	I am not free at 10 - 11 am or after 2:30 pm.
764	Houston.
764	Also, have you been able to confirm whether Don is the man in charge in Brazil?
764	Sara
765	Great!
765	I'll call you at 1pm Houston time.
765	SS
766	Who is handling the amendment?
767	Can you give me a little more info on this topic?
767	Is anyone in Houston involved?
767	I just want to make certain that we haven't missed anything in the process.
767	Thanks.
767	Sara
768	FYI - I will be out of the office on Feb. 3 and 4.
768	Let me know if you want to reschedule earlier.
768	Thanks.

769	Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to the distinction between "investor owned utilities" (or "IOUs") and municipal utilities (or "municipals") in connection with derivatives activity.
769	In the U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.
769	Thus, we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings.
769	A copy of that Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.
769	Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different.
769	When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of "Incipient Illegality" and an enforceability opinion.
769	A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference.
769	We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).
769	In that regard, would you recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?
770	Should we be entrenched in this type of activity?
770	I'm not even sure that we find out about all of ESA's ideas.
770	Sara
771	What is the issue?
771	I have no idea if anyone is looking at this.
771	Sara
772	It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!
772	I have been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some type of "Deal Report".
772	In Houston and Argentina, the business groups circulate a transaction listing.
772	Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina circulate a listing from Legal's perspective.
772	Is a commercial team deal report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the circulation?
772	I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.
772	It would be helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.
772	In that regard, what is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?
772	I am glad to prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.), Let's coordinate for the seminar which you are organizing for March.
772	Thanks.
772	Sara
773	Looks like he's an expat in Singapore.
774	Definitely Thursday or Friday - just let me know so that I don't leave and lock it up!
775	Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.
775	I have no real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing organized and running on a regular basis.
775	I would appreciate your input.
775	I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week.
775	Thanks.
775	Sara
776	Jeff Nogid has called about putting some ENE masters in place.
776	I have already spoken with Clement about this.
776	ENE will be trading FX, interest rate and equities through Gary's group.
776	Jeff mentioned names such as Merrill Lynch Cap.
776	Services, Credit Suisse and Sumitomo.
776	He will obtain specific names and contacts at the various firms and forward that information to me and/or Shari.
776	We'll let you know.
776	Sara
777	Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal opinion which, from my research, created the "issue" between SG&E and Enron North America Corp., formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. It might be easiest if SD&G reissues the opinion without the qualification contained in Paragraph 5.
777	Please let me know what you think.
777	Regards.
777	Sara
778	I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty.
778	Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that you would normally grant?
778	If so, who has issued the opinion?
778	I look forward to your reply.
778	Regards.
778	Sara
779	I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 & 4.
779	Carol is attending a class on Feb. 3.
779	Please direct inquiries to lawyers present on those two days.
779	Kaye Ellis knows how to reach me in Baton Rouge.
780	I just received a message from Anna Chung (?) at Merrill re: the ENE master.
780	Her number is 212-449-7494.
780	I also left vm for Jeff to send down deemed ISDA's or other confirms.
780	SS
781	I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.
781	The CP is anxious to receive an ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions.
781	Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).
781	Thanks.
781	Sara
782	James Hardie Australia Finance Pty. Limited Thanks for the response.
782	I'll let you know what I conclude (or am able to negotiate!).
782	Please keep me updated.
782	Sara
783	Absolutely!
784	Tracy Ngo will be preparing credit for an ISDA.
784	The draft should be sent to (Steve) Morus at the CP (check the green file because we've done an omnibus).
784	You can insert NY law but no other omnibus changes need to be made.
784	Thanks.
784	Sara
785	FYI
786	Test sent message, please reply.
786	Felix.
787	reply test2.
787	Felix
788	Drop by.
788	We've been trading financial power for over a year.
788	Not many deals, though.
788	Enron North America Corp.
789	We need a new ISDA using our current form changes.
789	Sara
790	FYI - we may need to revise.
790	Does this ISDA have our new changes?
791	email address is correct but I am not Carol St. Clair (the next name in your list).
792	We need to contact these guys before our legal/credit meeting.
792	Let me know if you want me to make the contact.
792	SS
793	Have you sorted through the ENE ISDA masters with Jeff Nogid?
793	Should I call him again?
793	Anyway, it looks like another request is attached.
793	Sara
794	I never heard back from you last week.
794	Can we continue to send this report monthly?
794	Some addressees have changed.
794	Sara
795	Feb. 17 is good for me.
796	Was the meeting this morning cancelled?
796	Rick Hopkinson and I waited for about fifteen minutes.
796	Sara
797	Does this sound familiar?
798	Hi!
798	I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this Master Agreement.
798	I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion.
798	Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a conference call.
798	You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.
798	Thanks.
798	Sara
799	per my voice mail
800	Are we also trying to put an ISDA in place?
801	Sounds like an interesting meeting.
801	SS
802	I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp) about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in connection with the loan for construction of the mill.
802	I know that Jarrod has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone has raised the ISDA issue.
802	Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.
802	Let me know if this has already been addressed.
802	Thanks.
802	Sara
803	(1) I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45) (2) Just a thought after seeing Shari's email: would the paralegals and/or lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" (valuing differences; creating understanding)?
803	Should this be mandatory with some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills?
804	I am in the process of finalizing the ISDA and need for you to provide me with a definition of the "Cross Border Lease" for insertion into Paragraph 12 of the Credit Support Annex.
804	I will need to refer to the lease in several places.
804	Thanks.
804	Sara
805	I generally don't forward this kind of stuff but this seemed interesting -
806	Why not?
806	I offered him the opportunity to choose his "investment Bar Mitzvah gift"!!!!
806	(or else I make the selection in his behalf)
807	What is a cardio cath?
807	Was she having problems.
807	Zach is not a little guy.
807	I'm going for an allergy shot.
807	I'm so tired that I'm getting to be boring.
807	I wish Mother had email.
807	We could have 3-way discussions.
807	Sas
808	Here's the document.
808	I'll bring the changes to you shortly.
808	Thanks.
808	Sara
809	Can we get together and review the outstanding issues?
809	How about this afternoon or tomorrow morning?
809	Sara
810	Thank you, dahling, for the lovely card.
810	I'm thinking of you as well (but I ALWAYS think of you).
810	I'll be thinking of you when I am in New York and especially when I pass by Ferragamo.
810	And when I pass by Tiffany's.
810	I hope your day is filled with valentines.
810	Love, Sas
811	How about 9 am tomorrow morning in my office?
812	This was the "explanation" that I forwarded to Shari for dealing with Canadian utilities, munis, etc. I'll follow up with her when you have identified specific Canadian counterparties or provinces which are needed for EOL.
812	Sara
813	Is 9 am OK?
814	Can you please advise of legal holidays in Brazil during the remainder of February and March?
814	I don't know how many days Mardi Gras/lent last.
814	I need to plan future trips to Sao Paulo.
814	Thanks.
814	Sara
815	Would you please send a calendar of legal holidays in Argentina for 2000?
815	At the moment, I need to plan for the remainder of February and March.
815	Thanks.
815	Sara
816	Sami: Can we schedule a short conference call to discuss?
816	I am in the office all week except for Friday (and Monday, February 21 is a legal holiday in the U.S.) Please let me know your availability.
816	Maybe you can select from the following this week: Tues, 2/15: 10:30 am until 1 pm, after 2 pm Wed., 2/16: 9 am until 10 am, 11am until 2 pm, after 3 pm Thurs., 2/17: 1 pm until 4 pm All of the foregoing times are Houston times.
816	Also, I am trying to verify holidays in Brazil for the remainder of the year.
816	Is Bracewell looking at early or late March?
816	Thanks.
816	Sara
817	Great!
818	FYI: Ed Quinn advises that he is once again in negotiations with P&G for a 5 year, 50,000T/yr SWAPTION.
818	When our prior negotiations with P&G were halted, we were waiting to review P&G's proposed alternative (or variation) to
819	Would you please incorporate all holidays for Enron Corp., Enron Argentina and ESB (Brazil) onto my calendar?
819	Thanks.
819	Sara
820	Attached is a clean and redline version of your document with Enron North America Corp.'s suggested changes.
820	Please call me to discuss when you have had an opportunity to review.
820	Also, does your document contain "coding" information?
820	I was a bit confused by some of the characters appearing in your version.
820	Regards.
820	Sara
821	I will be out of the office on Friday.
821	Monday is President's Day.
821	Shari or Carol may be available on Friday.
821	Sara
822	1.
822	At the end of the "Notice of Exercise" clause, ass"(but not both)" 2.
822	Instead of "Additional Provisions", insert the following: Special Provisions: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise by the Buyer of the option to enter into either Underlying Transaction I or Underlying Transaction II is conditioned upon (i) the execution by the parties on or before the Expiration Date of an ISDA Master Agreement and (ii) Enron Corp. Risk Assessment and Control approval [of what?].
822	In the event that either/both (?) condition is not satisfied prior to the Expiration Date, this Transaction shall terminate on such date without further action or payment required by either party.
823	Thurs: between 12 -4
824	Patricia: I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection with our discussion of last week.
824	I can't recall if you were going to try to speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, with respect to the template currently in circulation.
824	I think you were also going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.
824	Please advise when you have further information.
824	I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.
824	I am considering a trip to BA during the week of February 28.
824	Will you be in town that week?
824	During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation.
824	Regards.
824	Sara
825	I am planning a trip to BA from Feb. 27 - March 3.
825	The objective will be to present derivatives training for the BA traders, meet with tax and legal representatives and the Argentine Derivatives Association with respect to changing tax laws, legislation, and "local" derivatives trading, and sitting down with Mike Guerriero to establish an "action plan".
825	The monthly swap calendar does not indicate other lawyers out of the office during that week.
825	Please note this on the group calendar.
825	Thanks.
825	Sara P.S.
825	Mark - let me know if there are other issues you would like to have addressed.
826	FYI - You ought to choose one of these and start putting away money on a regular basis.
826	You'll be rich one day!!!!
826	Sas
827	yes, where?
828	Patricia: Thanks very much for your quick response.
828	I would very much like to solicit your help in arranging some meetings when Lynn Aven (tax) and I visit BA in two weeks.
828	We definitely want to meet with one or more members of the ADA who are responsible for drafting and implementing the new agreement.
828	And your suggestion to meet with your colleague who has been lobbying for derivatives tax legislation is one we readily accept.
828	Could you possible try to schedule these for convenient times on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 29 and March 1, respectively?
828	I will be out of the office tomorrow but in next week.
828	Enron is closed on Monday, February 21 for President's Day.
828	Let me know if you would like to speak directly of if I can assist in any way.
828	Looking forward to our visit.
828	Sara
829	Attached is the Media News draft confirm.
829	Paul will call about that one.
829	Traders will book new deal and kill prior transaction with Affiliated Newspapers.
829	(notice the merger and/or name change issues????)
830	I'm waitlisted on the Continental flight so we may be traveling separately.
830	I do, however, have a room reservation at the Sheraton Towers.
830	Kaye can help you.
830	I'm out of town tomorrow so let's regoup on Tuesday.
830	SS
831	Lynn and I will be in BA during the week of Feb. 28 to meet with lawyers, accountants, commercial group, etc. Just a heads up for you.
831	Sara
832	let's talk on Tuesday, dude
833	Congratulations!
833	What a great story for future generations.
833	Love, Sara
834	I will not be able to attend this afternoon's meeting as I have a doctor's appointment.
834	Also, I am looking forward to hearing details of Friday's luncheon.
834	Thanks.
834	Sara
835	The ball's in my court to respond to Basin.
835	sara
836	I don't think Marie handled yet.
836	Please handle and advise Brent that you are the person working on Argentina.
836	Also, we can send the latest deal report which we should discuss briefly (and the new list of addressees).
836	Thanks.
836	Sara
837	Patricia: Just checking to see if you received this message from last week and how the arrangements were proceeding.
837	Please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-5620.
837	Thanks.
837	Sara
838	looks fine with me
839	Credit has not received financials.
839	Can you help out here to get the ball rolling?
839	Sara
840	Please see attahed.
840	Let me know if you have questions about the option template and please let me know if you think the Delano draft satisfies the conversation we just had with Leslie.
840	Thanks.
840	Sara
841	In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March 1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.
841	I would appreciate hearing from you as quickly as possible in the morning because I already have requests to meet on those two days.
841	I would obviously like to defer to your plans.
841	Please call me tomorrow.
841	Thanks.
841	Sara
842	I'm receiving mine!!!
842	But I'll be in Buenos Aires next week so I'll keep my fingers crossed that my computer is working (in the event any further earth shattering Lehrer family announcements occur).
842	My mom does not know how to turn the computer on but she does have an email address.
842	We better wait until she "gets comfortable" with the concept of email before handing out her address.
842	At this very minute, my dad is returning from a convention in Atlantic City.
842	He called me from the airport on his CELL PHONE.
842	You see, it took me some time to get him to carry his cell phone with him.
842	I'VE SUCCEEDED!
842	Talk to you soon, Mr. Webmaster.
842	Sara
843	FYI
844	I think Tanya worked on this.
844	FYI, I'll be in Argentina next week.
844	SS
845	Patricia has asked who should be included in the group for Wednesday, March 1.
845	Do you and Andrea want to be included?
845	Any commercial people?
846	We do not have the answer for you at this time.
846	It must be researched.
846	Sara Enron North America Corp.
847	Whatever you can do is most welcome.
847	We are only limited by time.
847	We have set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.
847	We can also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.
847	I will advise shortly with respect to local invitees.
847	Thanks very much.
847	Sara
848	no
849	Only to make sure that we (especially Lynn Aven) can speak with your tax partner with respect to derivatives issues.
849	Thanks.
849	Sara
850	We'll do that and resend.
851	Patricia: Thanks for putting the meetings together.
851	In addition to Lynn Aven and me, both Andrea Calo and Brent Hendry would like to attend.
851	I'm looking forward to visiting with you next week.
851	Regards.
851	Sara
852	I received a message from Augustin David to return his call to discuss the master.
852	The number he left rings but does not answer.
852	I have tried calling several times.
852	Maybe we can talk to him next week when I am in BA.
852	Sara
853	I'll let them know.
853	It's very possible that one or both will be unable to attend due to the office activity but they both want to be available.
853	Thanks again.
853	Sara
854	Please change on my calendar
855	FYI
856	FYI - Shari Stack is negotiating the brokerage agreement with Banc One and there seems to be an issue over the interest rate.
856	Needless to say, I have never had any conversations with Banc One over this issue.
856	SS
857	Carol: I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.
857	I think credit should have a "separate worksheet" and make a determination for each question you've listed.
857	For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.
857	One issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a different level.
857	How does credit identify the counterparty, much less determine if that counterparty is an ESP?
857	I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be inadequate.
857	And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?
857	A separate list would help in the evaluation.
857	Are we going to have another credit lunch?
857	Hope all is going well.
857	Sara
858	Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29.
858	The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc. Please let me or Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.
858	Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed.
858	with Marval and the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.
858	Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.
858	Sami has been diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of references to PPA's and SWAPS.
858	We are still trying to get our arms around all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.
858	Have you heard from Yao?
858	This international position may be right up his alley.
858	Sara
859	Attached is the origination list from Brazil.
859	SS
860	Sami: I'm concerned about the deals showing up on the origination list which we received on Friday.
860	There are multiple references to swaps.
860	We need to talk.
860	I'm in Argentina and may not make the call tomorrow because I have meeting outside the office.
860	I'll try to call you tomorrow.
860	sara
861	Chuck: I am currently in our Buenos Aires office for the week.
861	I have to resolve our few issues when I return to Houston.
861	I can tell you, however, that we cannot agree to provide you with the legal opinion as to enforceability as we discussed in our conversation last week.
861	I'll follow up with you next week.
861	Sara
862	Where do you want to go?
863	Susan: This report should also be routed to the Argentine traders and, in Brazil, only Sami Arap (delete Robert George and Andrea Bertone).
863	Thanks.
863	Sara
864	I think that the reference may be in the setoff clause and the CP was trying to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only.
864	Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.
864	SS
865	Just kidding!
865	I'm fine.
865	I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave the office.
865	FYI: NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.
865	It's too early for the mutual fund reports.
865	The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for lunch and they were much better than tamales.
865	I read the tamale article in the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS (whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales were really HOT).
865	Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.
865	Thursday and Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an agreement.
865	I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).
865	Love, the DG
866	Would you please add me to th distribution list for clippings.
866	Thanks.
866	Sara
867	I hope you are doing well.
867	I finally have my laptop so I can at least read email during the day.
867	The weather here is gorgeous.
867	It's about 72 during the day and cooler at night.
867	We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of fudge" por d'creme.
867	Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in the Charlie Trotter cookbook.
867	Do you have that cookbook?
867	I know you have a lot of them.
867	I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday morning at 6:30 am.
867	Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.
867	How's mother and daddy?
867	I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail.
867	Love, PS Are you working on Friday?
868	I have meetings this morning with the Marval firm but was hoping you could help out here.
868	1.
868	Could you please check with the Alley Theatre Box Office and find out if I have tickets for a performance this Friday night (March 3).
868	They will check under the name "McKeogh" and my local phone number "713 664-3207".
868	Just let me know so that I can figure out what to do.
868	2.
868	Could you please change my McDonald's phone call presently scheduled for 1pm (BA time) tomorrow.
868	I would need to reschedule through Mike Irgang(info in lotus notes) at McDonald's and let Ed Quinn know.
868	My BA schedule is on my calendar.
868	3.
868	I am tentatively planning a trip to Sao Paulo.
868	I will stay from 3/17 through 3/27.
868	However, I need to arrive on 3/16 and depart on 3/28.
868	Could you please check flight availability?
868	I first need to clear through Mark Taylor and I will copy you on that message.
868	Thanks.
868	for now.
869	Mark: I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.
869	There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the commercial group and the lawyers as follows: 2.
869	March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts) I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 28).
869	In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.
869	Also, I can speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).
869	Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you have other thoughts.
869	Hope all is well.
869	Sara
870	The Alley is NOT holding any tickets for me.
870	All I want to know is whether "McKeogh" at "713-664-3207" has a ticket for a performance on Friday, March 3 since I do not have the tickets in front of me.
870	They should be able to tell you or just email the Box Office phone number to me.
870	Also, I can't do anything about flights until I return to Houston on Monday.
870	Thanks.
870	SS
871	You are brilliant!
871	Thanks for your help.

872	Hi Felix!
872	I return from Argentina this weekend.
872	I am having some problems with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return.
872	I am traveling with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of the daily problems which I have.
872	The problems are: 1.
872	Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message: "This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client - YES or NO" 2.
872	"Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk. File is in use by another program. Delete the file and create a new workspace?"
872	Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related to.
872	I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word.
872	When can we review these problems?
872	Thanks.
872	Sara
873	Rod and Susan: I met with the counterparty and lawyer last week.
873	Following are the results: Rod: CP would like a phone call to discuss the Schedule and CSA.
873	They mainly want explanations as to why ENA made the elections in the docs for: 1.
873	p.1 Cross Default Threshold 2.
873	p.
873	2 Additional Event of Default, part (xi) 3.
873	p.
873	4 issue providing Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated financials 4.
873	CSA p.2: How was Collateral Threshold determined Susan: CP would like the following: 1.
873	Schedule p.
873	3: sample certificates per third entry for docs to be delivered 2, " p. 5: need to get address 3. " p.
873	6: Process Agent.
873	Need to provide CP into on CT Corp. You will need to speak with Julian Poole because the CP has fairly good English (the lawyer does not speak English) and Julian may want to schedule the call.
873	I don't know how quickly the CP will want to act because there is a Stamp Tax issue to be resolved.
873	Thanks.
873	Sara
874	Lynn: I would like to standardize procedures for Argentina as much as possible (this week while fresh in my mind).
874	Attached is Julian's message to Houston.
874	Is this OK to put into email?
874	Let me know when you have time to breathe.
874	Also, in terms of an updated memo on Argentina issues, should I add to what you write or vice-versa?
874	My thought is to essentially update/modify the legal memo written in Dec., 1997 that Brent gave to us.
874	Let me know.
874	Thanks.
874	Sara
875	Per my email, you will need Julian on the phone due to the language problem.
875	All else is in Lotus Notes.
875	Sara
876	This is my favorite new game.
876	Also, the latest issue of "Wine Spectator" has a photo of Charlie Trotter on the cover.
876	SS
877	This if fine for me.
877	SS
878	per my vm
879	What kind of publicity have we been receiving over the weekend?
879	I'm glad to hear that you're doing better.
879	You didn't look too good Friday.
879	We had a great flight to Sao Paulo and then on to Houston.
879	I highly recommend going out of your way to fly Continental.
879	Mark is in Portland for a few days.
879	We are in competition (with Broadband) for our star paralegal, but I don't give up easily.
879	Shari did announce to me about her departure and may tell the paralegals today (I hope) Lynn and I are preparing a recap memo and we'll send a draft to you soon for comment Talk to you soon.
879	Sara
880	In the first paragraph, my reference to "Enron Comercializadora ..."
880	SHOULD READ "Enron Comercializadora de Energia Argentina S.A."
881	please edit.
881	thanks.
881	sara
882	Are you still living in London working for the bank?
882	Give me a call, sometime.
882	713-853-5620.
882	Thanks.
882	Sara
883	Lynn and I arrived safely in Houston and the weather seems much like Argentina last week.
883	That steak dinner was delicious and it will take me awhile to return to Pappa's or The Palm.
883	Thanks again.
883	Sara
884	I spoke with Rod Nelson about this party and Rod has been waiting to hear from you to speak with EDF.
884	I'm confused by your message as to who is to participate in your Thursday meeting.
884	FYI, there is an ENA meeting in Houston on Thursday afternoon.
884	SS
885	had to resend due to overworked network.
885	ss
886	Let me know when you have about 15 minutes for a "quick" question.
886	Thanks.
886	Sara
887	Here's what happened to the Enron South America LLC master.
887	You can now officially bug Robert George (legal in Sao Paulo) and Bruce Harris (commercial in Houston) and remove Andrea Bertone from any official distribution.
887	Sara
888	adventure reading below
889	per our conversation
890	Brent: attached is a draft memo that Lynn and I prepared.
890	We would appreciate your comments.
890	Also, who else do you think should be a recipient of this memo?
890	Should we prepare a separate "Action Plan" or strategy to submit to Mike?
890	You may recall in our meeting of Friday last that Mike committed to assess the long term situation in BA (at least I think that's what he agreed to do) and we (foolishly) committed to prepare a review of our activity in BA.
890	Maybe we can discuss on Friday morning at 9 am (Houston)/12 pm (BA).
890	Let us know if you have any questions.
890	I believe that Lynn is in a seminar on Thursday.
890	Sara
891	Susan: You may be aware of this database already.
891	I remembered it but asNony's message indicates below, I think I lost the link.
891	We need to keepthis link in mind (as well as updates since Alan has just updated Japan, foexample) when identifying resources for swap lawyers.
891	I'll schedule a shormeeting for us to recap soon.
891	Sara
892	FYI - Mike Ettringer from Portland called to follow up on this ISDA.
892	Not to worry, I'll let him know it's in the works.
892	SS
893	John Suarez entered into a 2-day swap with NYSEG papered with NYSEG'S "deemed ISDA" which I am reviewing.
893	Are we confirming financial in the name of EPMI?
893	Do you want to pursue the ISDA?
893	Tanya, are you still the credit person for this electric utility?
893	Is anyone speaking with these traders?
893	SS
894	It's not at the top of my list.
894	Sorry.
894	We'll have to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation.
894	SS
895	Mike: An ISDA Master Agreement is currently in the works for Deseret.
895	Marie Heard is the paralegal and I'll probably take a look at the document.
895	Please bear with us as we have lost one of our attorneys and are swamped.
895	Thanks.
895	Sara
896	Brent: sorry for my poor "attaching abilities."
896	Hopefully we will have a lot to discuss tomorrow.
896	Lynn has a suggested the use of a separate "action list" to present to Mike.
896	SS
897	The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.
897	The convention in the physical world (as I understand it) is that the seller sends its paper.
897	SS
898	By letter dated 3/9/00, Tembec Inc. has requested the transfer of "Contract No. EJ7774.1" dated 3/23/98 to the National Bank of Canada pursuant to Section 7 of the ISDA Master, to be effective April 1, 2000, but with Q1 payment to be made to Tembec.
898	We do have a master with the National Bank of Canada.
898	Please let us know if this transfer is approved.
898	SS
899	I received comments from Vintage (remember, no CSA).
899	With respect to Transfer, Vintage wants ENA to provide a guaranty of a transferee Affiliate's performance under the master.
899	Let me know your response, please.
899	Sara
900	Yes, offshore (ie, as ENA) with an onshore or offshore counterparty, as it desires.
900	SS
901	Whomever would like to add to their list can see me.
901	Thanks.
901	SS
902	Here's the doc I want to save -
903	I've scheduled a meeting with Guy on March 30
904	I think you're the wonder woman of swapland.
904	Congrats.
904	SS
905	I think this should work for the group (including Mark and Shari)
906	What should I do with this?
906	SS
907	I'll need help finalizing this (Flynn) Master.
907	Just let me know who can help on Monday.
907	Sara
908	major changes to Fixed Price and Additional Provisions
909	I read your language and I think its too vague.
909	You don't want to include existing risk management services.
910	For Monday
911	Did you ever receive any paperwork from this fund on behalf of Zachary?
911	How was NY?
911	Mother sure is talkative these days.
911	Hope all is well Sass
912	Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G. I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).
912	Also, I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize our financial trading matrix.
912	I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly.
913	On March 9, Susan Flynn sent to Ing.
913	Guillaume Rivron a memo regarding Process Agent (specifically, CT Corp.) and a form of certificate for Delivery of Documents.
913	This was copied to Martin Cassone and Julian Poole, both via fax.
913	Susan is out of the office most of this week.
913	SS
914	Greetings to you both!
914	It has been awhile since we last spoke.
914	I would like to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 1999.
914	Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of the Central Bank regulations.
914	Please let me know whether or not you agree or can offer any suggestions.
914	Thanks and regards.
914	Sara
915	We have been asked to assist in the setting up of an account with Morgan for the sale of this stock (through John Greene) held in the name of "Enron Communications Investments Corp.".
915	Restrictions (technically expired on 3/12/00) on the shares are in the process of being lifted by the transfer agent.
915	Let me know if you need further information.
915	We are working with Mike Deville and Gill Melman (ECI legal).
915	Thanks.
915	Sara
916	forwarding instructions
917	Same question I just asked you.
917	SS ps let me know if you can schedule Donna (excluding 2-3 pm)
918	I must be on a separate list because I do receive these clippings from A. Bueno.
918	Thanks.
918	SS
919	FYI - Southwestern Bell is installing equipment in my home on April 3.
919	They will call me 1 hour before arrival.
919	This is just a head's up that I may have to dash out sometime during the day.
919	SS
920	Attached is a sample "format" for summarizing swap group activity.
920	Please add your own activities and feel free to edit the sample.
920	Suggestions are welcome.
920	I'll edit responses in time for our meeting next week.
920	Thanks.
920	Sara
921	Please review and call me.
922	Patricia: I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and introductions for the Enron legal group.
922	Lynn and I are extremely grateful as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.
922	As always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom you are so well connected.
922	At the moment, we are trying to finalize an internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently affecting our business in Argentina.
922	I would appreciate your comment on the following two items: (1) Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not sure which it is) that "financial institutions" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on the spread?
922	Is it possible to see a copy?
922	(I can probably have it translated) (2) I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a local master swap agreement (local trades).
922	Execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.
922	Even when any transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal.
922	Brent thinks that the tax will be based on the product of the [Fixed Price X volume X term] even though the master agreement will merely provide for netting.
922	Can you verify?
922	Give my regards to Pablo.
922	I look forward to hearing from you.
922	Regards.
922	Sara
923	attached is redrafted language which can "stand alone" or we can also incorporate the chart.
923	(Jared, I think you have some prior language we can use, and we may have to rename one or two parts of the chart).
923	SS
924	OK, I have reviewed Lawhill and AIG Funds.
924	Marie is making changes and the goal is to get blacklines of AIG to Rod today (since AIG has credit issues only).
924	The issues revolve around the Collateral Threshold and Letters fo Credit.
924	Lawhill will be ready for execution.
924	SS
925	Have you run your change past this guy or Morley?
926	Thanks for your message.
926	We are in the process of turning a blackline.
926	Sara
927	Please open new file "Project Spector" (or Spectre?) and print the docs below.
927	Gareth Bahlman's assistant should know the name.
927	Thanks.
927	Sara
928	per our discussion
929	I thought there were 5 funds.
929	SS
930	Looks like nothing was ever done on this so I've contacted Tracy Ngo to move on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.
930	Do I need to call Holli?
930	Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on this?
930	Sara
931	Please print
932	Please print.
932	SS
933	Attached is a clean version which incorporates most of Brent's comments.
933	Please read again.
933	Sara
934	Yeah.
934	Also, Clem wants to join us for sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
934	Be careful.
934	Sara
935	We have been asked to set this entity up for financial trading.
935	It's part of our JV with Texaco.
935	Hal Bertram (X31865) is a good contact person if you have questions about the Bridgeline companies.
935	Thanks.
935	Sara
936	Here's the only info that I have on this counterparty.
936	Sara

941	PLEASE DISREGARD THE DRAFT MEMO SENT ON 3/16/00.
941	I have reworked a new memo which prints on 3 pages and which I hope is brief and to the point.
941	Let's try to talk before Friday so that we can send the memo before then.
941	I still have not heard from Patricia Lopez.
941	SS
942	I have to leave the office at 10:30 to be at my home.
942	I should be back after lunch.

942	Thanks.
942	Sara
943	print redline for each and the following
944	I gave the Kevin the OK and he was going to prepare a waiver letter.
944	Our conversation was some time ago.
944	Sara
945	Can you please forward my report from last week and update the "week".
945	Also, change target date of Argentina report to this Friday.
945	Thanks.
945	Sara
946	I'll need you to standby for coordination (only) on: Ghost unwind Specter Hawaii
947	Statoil - use of multiproduct guaranty similar to one executed by parent/ENE Spinnaker - sent draft to you BP - I'll see what we have to do Basin - name of contact.
947	No such person as Bob Hall
948	I am interested in flying.
948	Sara
949	This is the "format" for the exhibit to change payment accounts from the CP to the bank
950	Please review assignment language Par 12 (C),(G) for accuracy.
951	Attached is the list that Marie had prepared for me just last week (the date at the top is incorrect) which is a good start.
951	We will still need a detailed description of the brokerage agreement process.
951	Sara
952	Attached is revised language to drop in the confirm.
952	John: Please approve.
952	Joe: edit my margins AND does the preamble of the confirm use the word "Agreement" to define the Master Agreement?
952	THIS IS NOT AN ISDA!
953	Attached is the ESP definition taken from the commodities regulations.
954	From: Larry Joe Hunter 03/21/2000 10:50 AM
955	I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is perhaps interested in ENA.
956	Just an example of "brokerage account stuff" that can occur with respect to a single account.
956	SS
957	you are too good Enron North America Corp.
958	John is the ONLY authorized trader for the Morgan account.
958	SS
959	OK - forget the prior list I sent!
959	It really WAS from 1998.
959	Attached is a real live current version which can be expanded.
959	Sara
960	Please follow up.
960	Also, we need to follow up with Chuck Gilbert (counsel for CP) for docs.
960	Thanks.
960	Sara
961	yes, I can attend Enron North America Corp.
962	Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second "Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of Rhythms stock).
962	The rationale for a second trader is not new to us: in John Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.
962	It is my understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.
962	Please let me know if you have any questions.
962	Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar with this transaction.
962	Sara
963	Pablo: I am forwarding this message that I send to Patricia last week.
963	She may be out of town or otherwise engaged.
963	Would it be possible for you (or someone else in the firm) to respond to my two questions?
963	I only need a short explanation.
963	If you need to reach me, my telephone is (713) 853-5620 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.
963	Thank you for your assistance.
963	Regards.
963	Sara
964	I received a message without further identification and I'm momentarily baffled.
964	Maybe the name rings a bell.
964	Thanks.
964	Sara
965	That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).
965	Regards.
965	Sara
966	We now need to appoint David Vitrella as an authorized trader for the ECIC account (per Ted's OK below).
966	Sara
967	The following transactions are happening this week and quarter end (as to Project Hawaii 125-0): Project Ghost unwind Project Spector (remaining Rhythms stock put into identical Ghost structure) Project Hawaii 125-0 (permanent structure to handle FASB -125 deals) Rod: I believe you looked at Ghost last year.
967	Let me know if you have any Spector issues.
967	Bill and Rod: I will send you summary terms for Project Hawaii 125-0.
968	Attached are summary documents.
968	I am in the process of reviewing the swap piece now.
968	Sara
969	HELP!
970	let me know if this prints ok
971	I left a message yesterday for Chris Littlefield to schedule call.
971	I have not heard back.
971	SS
972	Per our discussion, please see attached.
972	Sara
973	Hi, Serge.
973	I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.
973	Paul Karns mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement.
973	Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.
973	You can reach me via email or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.
973	I will be negotiating the agreement on behalf of ENA.
974	Please see attached.
974	SS
975	Per my voice mail, please add the following sentence after the two signature blocks: The undersigned hereby guarantees the timely payment when due of the obligations of Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC under this Transaction and this Confirmation in an amount not to exceed U.S. $5,000,000.
975	BRIDGELINE GAS MARKETING LLC By: Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. P.S to Bob: I am not certain of the signature line as I have not heard back from Barbara.
976	We have to respond to comments on the Credit Support Annex and a few items in the Schedule..
976	We are waiting for copies of standing PUC orders from PG&E (addressing derivatives issues) as well as a blackline of the Schedule since PG&E controls the drafting.
976	Sara
977	Attached is an updating memorandum addressing the impact of Argentine tax issues on our trading business in Argentina.
978	Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to you at once.
978	I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.
978	You will see our "No Reliance" and "Limitation of Liability" provisions included.
978	None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).
978	Unfortunately, I do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written guidelines or policy addressing the provision of quotes to customers.
978	I will follow up when I have the response.
978	Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference.
978	Regards.
978	Sara
979	As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC ("ESA") confirmation issue is draining our little brains.
979	Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled.
979	Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.).
979	Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S. Brent: please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.
979	Sara
980	Mike: I have not heard from since my prior message attached below.
980	Have you had a chance to consider our request?
980	I look forward to hearing from you.
980	Please email or call me at (713) 664-3207.
980	Regards.
980	Sara
981	It was slight address change to: sshackl@enron.com (the address only deleted the "ect" piece)
982	Brent: We'll call you at 2 pm Houston time.
982	Thanks.
982	Sara
983	I will be unable to make the meeting tomorrow.
983	I have no changes to my list from last week.
983	Thanks.
983	Sara
984	I spoke with Chris Littlefield (legal) a few moments ago and he would like for you to call Dial's treasury person, Dave Riddiford.
984	Dial really wants an explanation of how/why all numbers were selected for inclusion in the Schedule and CSA, including: (2) whether Credit Event Upon Merger can be tied to ratings downgrade (I explained the MAC trigger) (3) Collateral Threshold (and, by the way, Chris says that he never understood that Dial would ever have to post) Not too bad.
984	Call me if you have any questions.
984	From the legal perspective, I have only to resolve recording and arbitration.
984	Thanks.
984	Sara
985	The latest swap schedule and confirm are in the documents attached.
985	Sara
986	Attached are comments to the Schedule but not the CSA.
986	Russell: Have you had any conversations with FP&L credit?
987	Attached is my recollection of items to be decided once Marie leaves the group.
988	See attached.
988	Bob: please call me.
988	SS
989	Susan: Please change the signature block as set forth below and I'll review.
989	Also, we'll email to CP.
989	SS
990	Brenda: This looks fine.
990	Please have an executed copy sent to the attention of Susan Flynn (for ENA's files).
990	Sara

993	Is EES the swap counterparty?

1001	Sara
1002	Close.

1006	Hi Nancy!
1006	I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you were there.
1006	We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on behalf of ESA.
1006	Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).
1006	Please give me or Brent a call.
1006	We're trying to get this done next week since TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm.
1006	Also, let's have lunch.
1006	Sara
1007	Is there a call in the morning?
1007	Everyone will be in Houston.
1007	Sara
1008	(1) The term "Threshold Amount" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., "Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).
1008	Credit sets the threshold level and we input that number into the document.

1011	Hi, Trena!
1011	I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on to power trading (legal).
1011	My first task has been to reconcile the outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.
1011	I find three: (1) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd: booked (2) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ through 4/29/11] (3) Currency Swap between "ECT" and "Sutton Bridge" booked 3/29/00 [ through 3/31/03].
1011	I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.
1011	I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending Sutton Bridge sale.
1011	Are you terminating these three (3) trades?
1011	Are there others?
1011	What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know anything about it)?
1011	Someone should be documenting the termination and payout.
1011	Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio tomorrow.
1011	Thanks.

1013	Sara
1014	I'm working on it.

1024	David: Please give me another day to review your email.
1024	Thanks.
1024	Sara
1025	Just a heads up!
1025	ENA has finalized our Master Swap Agreement with Statoil.
1025	You may recall that Statoil would now like to execute an agreement with ECTRIC using the ENA agreement as a model.
1025	I have been dealing with the Statoil inhouse lawyer whose name is Chuck O'Brien.
1025	Regards.
1025	Sara
1026	Attached are copies of the drafts sent to ABN AMRO Incorporated in January, 2000.
1026	I have been out of town and apologize for the delay.
1026	Sara
1027	Sorry, I filled out the form and sent it to HR.
1027	It was difficult to rank the candidate using the printed form but I thought she looked very good and after speaking with Elizabeth to get her impressions (which I have not done), I would probably make her an offer.
1027	Sara
1028	please respond
1029	Marie: Sutton Bridge was sold.
1029	That is all I know.
1029	Following is the situation regarding outstanding swaps.
1029	We need to keep a record somewhere.
1029	Sara
1030	As you may know, Project Ghost was unwound eff.
1030	3/31/00.
1030	I believe that Project MacArthur was also unwound.
1030	(but I haven't seen anything).
1030	Also, Project Blackbird is in the process of being unwound.
1030	Each will have a Swap Termination Agreement.
1030	Brenda Funk should be organizing closing docs.
1030	Please make necessary entries on Lotus Notes and keep supporting documentation in the files.
1030	I don't see Projects Ghost, Spector or Hawaii on Lotus Notes (these show up on your status of files list to Mark. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions. Sara
1031	Chris: I left voice mails for both Tracy Ngo and Tanya Rohauer about Delano.
1031	I've had no response.
1031	SS
1032	Bob: I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.
1032	I thought that the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't verified that item prior to sending.
1032	I have not had a chance to review Kris's fax If you have your own form, please send and we can review.
1032	Sara
1033	Julia: To close the loop, it appears that none of the swaps were terminated.
1033	Sara
1034	Sheila: Please per my voice mail, let's sit down in my office and catch up because there are a lot of loose ends on the brokerage side (particularly with Marie leaving).
1034	I can address you emails (current and past) at that time.
1034	Thanks.
1034	Sara
1035	David: Attached is an example of the "tainted swaption".
1035	I'd really like to focus on the dates (Trade, Effective, Exercise).
1035	Looking forward to call in the morning.
1035	Sara
1036	We are very short on legal help at the moment.
1036	Please permit me to respond to your request early next week with an acceptable time.
1036	Thank you.
1036	Sara
1037	Has this ever been finalized?
1038	Taffy told me that Susan's husband had court this morning so she is late.
1038	Is this weird or am I weird?
1038	Sara
1039	I am still waiting to hear whether ENA will transact with [Soc Gen] today (or whether Enron Australia will document its first weather trade).
1039	SS
1040	That will be fine.
1040	SS
1041	ENA has a multibranch ISDA master with Soc Gen. SS
1042	After "Written Confirmation of Notice of Exercise", add the following: "Seller's facsimile number for purposes of giving notice:" [we need a person and fax number because the master refers only to 'President" and Jarrod: is the counterparty asking for a special type of delivery (I wouldn't think so)
1043	FYI only
1044	Do you have a phone number?
1044	thanks
1045	Susan: In Marie's absence, could you please send Paul Simons a copy of the Statoil master?

1047	Thanks.
1047	Sara
1048	Kaye will update the confirm/settlement list and send out the email.
1048	Do you want her to handle global contracts or will you?
1048	Sara
1049	Marie: I would like to schedule a meeting with you and others to review the agreement process, your contacts, account information, record retention (physical files and Lotus Notes), reporting procedures, any forms which you have developed and helpful tips.
1049	I know that you are working on a memo which will address this information and it would be extremely helpful if we could learn from your experience.
1049	I would also like to discuss Ted Murphy's expectations.
1049	I think this will take about an hour.
1049	Please give me a suggested time during the week.
1049	Thanks.
1049	Sara
1050	FYI
1051	nothing attached
1052	FYI only.
1052	It looks like this trade will be done by EAF.
1053	I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.
1053	The initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.
1053	On a slightly different note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review work in progress, issues, products, etc.?
1053	If so, who should be included?
1053	Thanks.
1053	Sara
1054	Had a conversation with PG&E this afternoon and we're almost finished.
1054	Just a few loose ends to tie up.
1054	Sara
1055	Attached is the latest Cadwalader draft memo addressing additional risks posed by newer, illiquid products (specifically paper and pulp) and minimization of the risks.
1055	My goal is for the paper and pulp group to adopt the recommendations.

1055	I would like to respond to Cadwalader by the middle of next week.
1055	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1055	Thanks.
1055	Sara
1056	Has Taffy finalized the confirm "hotline" solution?
1056	The paralegals have no plan other than to rely on the confirm desk to call a live person.
1057	Bob: I left you a voice mail last week about a lunch that legal would like to present next month for both groups (above).
1057	We need a list of settlements persons who should be invited.
1057	The purpose of the meeting is to provide an overview of the legal documentation process, including explanations of our documents, and encourage dialogue among the groups.
1057	Please send as soon as possible.
1057	Also, let me know if you have any particular topics which you would like to see addressed.
1057	Thanks.
1057	Sara
1058	Settlements cannot attend a May 5 lunch (but could do May 12).
1058	Can we switch Credit to May 5?
1058	SS
1059	Please hold these names until we can agree on a date for this luncheon.
1059	Thanks.
1059	SS
1060	Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party to whom a confirm should be directed.
1060	Thanks.
1060	SS
1061	If the letter is alright, I can have it printed formally.
1061	I never heard back from Gareth with respect to any comments.
1061	Just let me know what you would like to do.

1067	Sara
1068	Marie: Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.
1068	I would like to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time.
1068	I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times.
1068	Thanks.
1068	Sara
1069	Marie is updating her list and preparing a general memorandum in connection with the brokerage and futures agreements.

1072	Also, who signs an enforceability opinion (under either NY or Texas law)?
1072	Thanks.
1072	Sara
1073	Per my voice mail.
1073	I think Suzanne already reserved a room.
1074	Tanya: the Morgan lawyer called about putting ISDA Master Agreements in place with the following Enron entities: Enron Canada Corp. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. (trading UK nat gas) Enron Liquid Fuels Inc. (trading propane) She indicated that guaranties were all about to expire in June.
1074	All of Morgan's commodity business is being centralized in the above Morgan entity.
1074	Please let me know how you are going to handle this in case Beth Ng calls me back.
1074	Thanks.
1074	Sara
1075	Gosh, I guessed right!!!!
1076	Mark: I know that David Minns has been sending copies of executed agreements to Alan.
1076	These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. We need to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to have access to our database.
1076	Do you want to speak with Alan or should I?
1076	Also, on a related issue, do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master Agreements in Houston?
1076	Would this be necessary in an emergency situation?
1076	Thanks.
1076	Sara
1077	Susan: You were going to verify whether the ABN AMRO futures agreement should be executed by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. (or ENA with Shane acting pursuant to the Services Agreement).
1077	Please let me know so that either David or I can move forward on the futures agreement.
1077	Thanks.
1077	Sara
1078	Do you have the short information sheet/request that you threw together for Enron company requests for brokerage agreements?
1078	This would be helpful when we meet.
1078	I am shooting for Friday at 10 am.
1078	Thanks.

1079	Are we ready to send execution copies?
1079	Sara
1080	Rod: Is this one ready to go?
1080	Please talk to Susan.
1080	Thanks.
1080	Sara
1081	Paul: Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.
1081	Now for the real issues: could you send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit derivatives in the UK?
1081	Also, are there any other materials which might be helpful in the credit derivatives area?
1081	Shari has passed this on to me and I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month.
1081	Thanks.
1081	Sara
1082	Carol: I haven't heard a peep about this deal until this email.
1082	You may want to check with someone on the weather desk.
1082	SS
1083	Marty: I will have a response to setoff shortly.
1083	With respect to the CSA and calculation of the "Credit Support Amount," our change should not create any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number.
1083	The only reason for "specifying otherwise" in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.
1083	By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be "the higher of" the amount calculated (deemed to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts, the latter would prevail.
1083	This calculation method will make a difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned).
1083	I hope this helps.
1083	Sara
1084	yes
1085	Please review and let's discuss.
1085	SS
1086	Mark: How should we handle this?
1086	In the past, I have provided Andrea Bertone with Elizabeth Sager's latest (and evolving) physical trading forms which Tozzini has used as a starting point.
1086	Sara
1087	I'm tied up from 1-3.
1088	The meeting has been moved to 1:30 - 2:30, Thursday, April 20 in Conference Room 38C1.
1089	Here's the email I just sent.
1089	If you can't find a conference room nearby (same elevator bank), I'll opt for my office.
1090	Won't you miss Alec?
1091	By the way, did you resolve Zachary's "fund" issue?
1091	Sas ps I'm going to call you when I get a break.
1091	I learned that I have a ticket to the game on Sat.
1091	Oh, joy!
1092	Hi, Shane.
1092	Here's a quick update.
1092	As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a done deal.
1092	Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA because she didn't have an address.
1092	I asked her to email you for the info.
1092	I am working on ABN AMRO.
1092	I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading activity.
1092	Let me know if you ever have any questions.
1092	Sara
1093	We need to finalize.
1093	Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my recollection is that he may not need the back up).
1093	Have we requested the guaranty?
1093	Thanks.
1093	Sara
1094	I have engaged the Modrall firm in Albuquerque to help us sort through the legal issues posed by dealing with the Southern Utes both on and off line.
1094	The lawyers are Messrs. Lynn Slade and Bill Scott.
1094	I would like to send a Fed Ex to them on Friday, April 21 for Monday morning delivery containing the following: 1.
1094	ISDA Master Agreement and CSA boilerplate 2.
1094	Our municipal form of Schedule for the Southern Utes and appropriate Paragraph 13 3.
1094	A sample Schedule prepared for a general corporate (with appropriate disclaimer language) 4.
1094	A copy of the 1993 Commodity Definitions and the 2000 Supplement You will have to verify the current firm name.

1096	Sara
1097	FYI
1098	I am ready to finalize the letter agreement.
1098	Please verify that Jeff McMahon will sign for Enron Corp. Thanks.
1098	Sara
1099	Tanya: I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding issue: paragraph (B) of our setoff language.
1099	This provision allows the nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other agreements between the parties) by the defaulting party have been paid.
1099	Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.
1099	Remember, we have already given in on "affiliate setoff".
1099	[the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) issue until this week!] Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided to issue transferable L/C's.
1099	Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.
1099	I do not know if this is a deal breaker.
1100	Carol: I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).
1100	Apparently we were dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.
1100	We agreed to (1) mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been negotiated last year (with our form changes).
1100	John Scales (exploration side) wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.
1100	Do you want to handle?
1100	Just let me know.
1100	Sara
1101	I have an early afternoon appointment.
1101	Sara
1102	Thanks so very much.
1102	Sara
1103	Please send the current DRAFT to the User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions to my attention.
1103	I understand that these can be sent to reply mail.
1103	You can reach me by phone at 713/853-5620 if you have any problems.
1103	Thanks.
1103	Sara Shackleton [Enron North America Corp.]
1104	A message from my crazy sister!
1105	Hey, Sam: Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as good as ever.
1105	Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or The Boulders?
1105	I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for the fact that people age faster.
1105	I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover since the seders were in the middle of the week.
1105	But I know that my sister ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other Manhattan establishments.
1105	My niece has been accepted at that high school in Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).
1105	Jennifer is only 15.
1105	My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.
1105	My parents are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.
1105	He'll be 83 in June.
1105	I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.
1105	Otherwise, I'm rocking along.
1105	You know, I never called Helen but I still have her number and I'll do it this week.
1105	Hope all is well.
1105	Do you keep up with Ron?
1105	Love, Sara
1106	the closing checklist contains the sub-trusts for Hawaii
1107	attached are swap docs for the Hawaii transaction
1108	Michelle: Could you please send me the latest form of agreement that ENA should be using with its outside consultants?
1108	Thanks.
1108	If you have any questions, please give me a call.
1108	Sara
1109	Is it possible to obtain a copy of the draft "User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions" today?
1109	I would very much appreciate receipt as soon as possible.
1109	Enron is a member of ISDA.
1109	Thanks again.
1109	Sara Shackleton
1110	no changes since last week
1111	Please let Randy know that I have another meeting scheduled at that time.
1111	Thanks.
1111	Sara
1112	No, but we add different provisions to the Master Agreement for commodity trades and currency/rate trades.
1113	Believe it or not, we are almost done but PG&E's lawyer has been so busy that we were unable to schedule a call last week.
1113	I will send her some suggested comments (tonight) and we are trying to speak this week.
1113	There aren't any problems.
1113	Sara
1114	FYI new request.
1114	What about our master tax agreement?
1115	Do you need to pass this on to Greg?
1116	Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online trading operation.
1116	His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the next 30 days (but not trade).
1116	I told Harry that I would need to review the agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.
1116	Although Harry does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future.
1116	We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.
1116	Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement "as is" for the limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of terminating the agreement when he is done.
1116	Although ENA would have a password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to assist?].
1116	Please let me know your decision.
1116	Thanks.
1116	Sara
1117	Ed: Jason Peters is an A&K lawyer working with us for about six weeks and he's helping on these agreements.
1117	We would like to meet with you about these lenders and update ENA's position.
1117	Could you please send me the "comparison chart" which you prepared for these banks and ED&F Mann and Paribas, and let me know when you are available to meet?
1117	Thanks.
1117	Sara
1118	Wednesday afternoon works fine for me.
1118	Sara
1119	Jeff: I have not heard a word from credit.
1119	Who did you speak with?
1119	Please let me know and I will follow up.
1119	Thanks.
1119	Sara
1120	Julian, 5 pm BA time is 3 pm Houston.
1120	Before we speak, please verify that Rod will be available at 3 pm Houston.
1121	I'm not impressed.
1121	Sara
1122	I have doctors' appointments from 10:30 am - 3 pm on Friday.
1123	Rod and Tanya: Please let me know who is handling so I can pass on the news to Jeff.
1123	Thanks.
1123	Sara
1124	Hi, David!
1124	Hope all is well.
1124	Since the referenced swap has been documented by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.
1124	I have a number of questions, many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback weather stations and a few other comments.
1124	I thought I would mark this up and fax it to you which I will do shortly.
1124	Sara
1125	I have to leave the office by 10:45 am.
1125	That should be enough time.
1125	SS
1126	Does anyone have any ISDA comparisons that I can give to Jason?
1126	Sara
1127	Pls add to my calendar.
1127	SS
1128	Neither Susan has any comparisons.
1128	Flynn eagerly volunteered amendments she's got lying around.
1128	I'm indifferent although I wonder if Flynn is simply trying to use the system.
1129	BY THE WAY, your voice mail does not work!
1129	If your phone calls roll over to an assistant or I try to leave you a voice mail, I cannot get there!
1129	Please call or stop by.
1129	Sara
1130	Robert: Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of the first part of the first sentence in the "Setoff" language.
1130	I just wanted to explain why we are requesting this change.
1130	In reviewing our forms during the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA Schedule and CSA.
1130	One of these changes was the deletion of the preamble language contained in the setoff provision.
1130	We concluded that the phrase "Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff ...;provided, however," actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early Termination Date.
1130	What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the setoff provision?
1130	Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620.
1130	Thanks.
1130	Sara
1131	I used the wrong email address!
1132	Per my voice mail, attached is draft letter.
1133	Jack: I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about the guaranty.
1133	I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format.
1133	Also, I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a "General Guarantee Agreememt" on behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) on January 28, 1998.
1133	Which format are you interested in using?
1133	Our cap for financial transactions with PG&E is, I believe, $10 million.
1133	Please give me a call as I am the first point of contact for negotiating the guaranty.
1133	Thanks.
1133	Sara
1134	Joe: Per my voice mail, see part (iii) of the above and please revise to provide accurate description of the condition to which you agreed with MediaNews.
1134	Just to say "ENA closes on the KPM Lasara L.P. newsprint mill" is not sufficient.
1134	Sara
1135	If you send the letter, please forward a copy to me.
1135	SS
1136	Jason: I still cannot access your voice mail (isn't your extension 34454?) If I'm right, please have your assistant look into this.
1136	Can we put these two brokerage agreements (below) at the top of your list?
1137	Sheila: Paul Radous (Ext. 58356) in credit will be monitoring brokerage accounts from a credit perspective.
1137	I have provided him with an overview of the "process".
1137	When he has had an opportunity to digest the information, I think it would be helpful to meet with Paul.
1137	In the meantime, would you please begin to copy Paul on all messages to Ted Murphy regarding the purpose of new accounts.
1137	Thanks.
1137	Sara
1138	Tanya: What is this all about?
1138	Are you still going to decide credit issues for the ISDA?
1138	Sara
1139	Tanya: Yes, there is an outstanding issue.
1139	Please read the attached and let me know when you'd like to discuss.
1139	Thanks.
1139	Sara
1140	Abbey: On March 29, you left me a voice mail in connection with the foregoing.
1140	Please call me at 713/853-5620 for an update and to answer you questions.
1140	There is not much left to do.
1140	Thanks.
1140	Sara Shackleton
1141	Mark: Thus far, I have uncovered only one "nondocumented" electronic agreement.
1141	The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and broker dealers.
1141	There is no agreement for this matching service.
1141	I am not aware of other "matching services" and whether any agreements are in place.
1141	Let me know if you have any concerns.
1141	Thanks.
1141	Sara
1142	ENA sent execution copies of the ISDA to Kellogg Company on April 10.
1142	By copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies of our documents for use in your negotiations.
1142	Let me know if you have any questions.
1142	Sara
1143	I have a morning appointment and will be in afterwards.
1143	Sara
1144	Rod: You may recall that we spoke about upgrading the old Master Energy Price Swap to an ISDA.
1144	Can you please send a new credit worksheet?
1144	If you are not handling, please let me know who to nag.
1144	Thanks.
1144	Sara
1145	(1) In connection with Taffy's report, please note the following: Aquila Canada Corp. - follow up Christiania Bank - need to send for execution Ospraie - send revisions (2) Also, what have you heard from Laurie about the Australian ISDA's and brokerage agreements?
1145	We should begin incorporating into our database.
1145	If we use your assistant, we should input data during the regular business day.
1145	(3) I have Jason helping me on about seven different brokerage arrangements and will soon need appropriate backup to send together with execution copies.
1145	I am keeping dummy files until these are finalized.
1146	Kaye: Would you please schedule a meeting with John Suttle to discuss Harvard.
1146	One hour will be fine.
1146	Thanks.
1146	Sara
1147	Susan: I wanted to clarify whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).
1147	As an example, I can only rely upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.
1147	For book and tax purposes, the trade is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.
1147	The Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).
1147	The credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal back to back transaction with the "booking" Enron affiliate) for which the "booking" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services agreement.
1147	Consider: ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
1147	Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth Bank of Australia?
1147	Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove described arrangement?
1148	That's fine but I have to leave shortly before 5 tomorrow.
1148	Sara
1149	I'm on the conference call now.
1149	John Novak suggested that you, he and Frederico speak.
1149	It sounds like commercial and credit need to iron this out together.
1149	John is in his office now and the call usually takes about an hour.
1149	Sara
1150	and I also need a file for: Goldman Sachs & Co. electronic agreement
1151	Mark: Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.
1151	Just one more question, please: is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English law?
1151	How often do you negotiate to the contrary?
1151	Thanks.
1151	Sara
1152	Hey, Julian!
1152	Susan is working on it now.
1152	SS
1153	AFAC and Marcelo: I hope this message finds you both well.
1153	I would like to finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a "baseline" for future updates.
1153	Please feel free to date the matrix as of December, 1999, if you wish.
1153	Please forward any recent changes to me for comment and I will respond immediately.
1153	Then we can move on to other things!
1153	Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.
1153	Regards.
1153	Sara
1154	Thanks for the redraft!
1154	I am looking at the agreement now.
1154	Also, I thought you would be interested in Mark's comment.
1154	I would like to use arbitration in lieu of jurisdiction.
1154	Please make that change and forward to me.
1154	I will mark up with comments.
1154	Thanks so much for your help.
1154	Sara
1155	Please follow up with counterparty for executed doc and enter into Lotus Notes.
1155	INSIST on commercial help now if there's a problem.
1156	(1) Please change Consolidated Papers Inc. to "medium" priority.
1156	(2) Please follow up on James Hardie and enter into Lotus Notes.
1157	Susan: Would you please follow up with Bridgeline now as I am preparing a futures agreement for them!
1157	We need them to get their act together.
1157	Thanks.
1157	Sara
1158	Tanya: There's no short answer with these people!
1158	I think we are fine with their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the Payee).
1158	So here's my recommendation: (1) Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.
1158	He has some kind of suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be based upon satisfaction that "nondisputed" amounts having been paid by the DP.
1158	Will he also raise the "other agreements" issue here?
1158	Not a clue.
1158	(2) If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M FINE.
1158	(I'm fine without part B, actually) (3) The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, right off the bat.
1158	I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A as applying to "other agreements between the parties".
1158	But Cargill proposed part A and it DOES apply to "other agreememts between the parties."
1158	I don't want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this again with Marty.
1158	Thanks for your continued help.
1158	Sara
1159	Hi, Sami!
1159	Sorry we missed the call yesterday.
1159	I just wanted to update you on some of the financial trading issues in Brazil (and I have added you to the working group list).
1159	I am going to finalize our "swap matrix" for Brazil.
1159	On the physical trading side, I had asked a physical trading lawyer to call you and am wondering if Elizabeth Sager ever called or emailed.
1159	Please let me know.
1159	Thanks.
1159	Sara
1160	That will be fine.
1160	Sara
1161	Edward: See attached revision (and please copy me if sent).
1161	Thanks.
1161	SS
1162	Roy: Call me and let's coordinate.
1162	Sara
1163	Susan: Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman.
1163	Not much to do here because we'll need only a signature (get Gary Hickerson to sign).
1163	I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will give you to add.
1163	We do not need certificates or our typical authorized trader list to send back.
1163	However, we will have to authorize password applicants on Goldman's form.
1163	How does EOL keep track of this?
1163	We will have to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be more) and I think he's still ENA.
1163	I know that we will want to receive the password very soon.
1163	Thanks.
1163	Sara
1164	Please put attached in the SITA file.
1164	The ISDA parties are ENA and SITA.
1164	Michael Khajeh-No in the London office will be negotiating this agreement with SITA on behalf of ENA.
1165	Jay: I am a lawyer with Enron.
1165	I called for you on Friday, you're out, and no one else could help.
1165	I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.
1165	Please call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.
1165	Thank you for your help.
1165	Sara
1166	Susan: for the SITA file.
1167	Tana: Please see Sami's message below.
1167	Is there something you can send?
1167	SS
1168	Barbara: Ted Murphy asked if we would negotiate a futures agreement (for Bridgeline) with Sakura Dellsher, Inc. You may recall that we previously handled the ADM Investor Services, Inc. futures arrangement for Bridgeline.
1168	Sara
1169	Kim: Thanks for your call.
1169	Legal received credit for Tuscon on 5/1/00 from Ed Sacks.
1169	Susan Flynn is preparing the ISDA agreement to send to the counterparty.
1169	Let me know if you have any other questions.
1169	Sara Susan: Please let Kim know when the draft will be sent.
1169	Thanks.
1169	Sara
1170	Susan: I would like to have this agreement (all three parts) executed early Monday and faxed to Goldman.
1170	Gary Hickerson can sign for Enron North America Corp. together with Ted Murphy as the second signatory.
1170	Please prepare an addendum or annex for the Client Access Agreement with the following inserts for Paragraph 9: INSERT 1 to Paragraph 9(g) after the word "enjoined": "upon proof of any such breach" INSERT 2 which will replace the second and third sentences in Paragraph 9(h) : "Any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be resolved pursuant to the ARBITRATION provision contained in Schedule A to this Agreement."
1170	For purposes of the password ID application, we must verify that Harry Arora is still authorized to trade for ENA (and employed by ENA).
1170	Roy Ibasco is coordinating for Harry.
1170	After signing, we can fax to Goldman and I have the fax info.
1170	Thanks.
1170	Sara
1171	Per my voice mail.
1172	clean copy of fax I left for you on Friday.
1172	Sara
1173	Ted: Later this morning, we will be sending the Goldman electronic agreement for execution.
1173	Harry Arora will be the only "trader" authorized to receive a password for ENA.
1173	We will ask Harry to advise us when he is finished and can then terminate (if we wish) once Harry has reviewed the website for Enron Networks.
1173	Thanks.
1173	Sara
1174	In connection with the "upgrading" of these old ERMS masters, I have limited information which Jeff Nogid (X34782) will verify.
1174	Please verify spelling of names, addresses, etc. Morgan Guaranty Trust - legal is Michael Stolfi (212-648-8231) or the trader is Henry Stuart (212-648-9057) Morgan Stanley - Jeff will get the info today We should include a cover letter in each indicating the reason why we are submitting.
1174	Let me know if you have any questions.
1174	Thanks.
1174	Sara
1175	I will deliver a new version which you can "fix" and send to Elizabeth.
1175	SS
1176	Scott: Thanks for the delivery.
1176	I didn't receive anything last week.
1176	Sara
1177	Call me.
1178	Trena: Can you please let me know if the docs from Chase are to amend the existing Repo Agreement between ENA and Chase?
1178	What type of transactions will you be doing with Chase?
1178	The docs I received are from a woman named Monica Turner and she has not returned my phone call.
1178	She did not provide an email address so I don't know how to get in touch with Chase.
1178	Can you help?
1178	Maybe get me another name?
1178	Thanks.
1178	Sara
1179	Sami: Attached are the most recent ENA power trading agreements.
1179	Parts of the agreements may be useful to you and/or Jose Emilio (or whomever you are working with).
1179	Tozzini began with the earlier ENA template.
1179	Please forward any translated trading docs to my attention.
1179	Thanks.
1179	Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
1179	Sara
1180	Jeff: Are there any issues that I might address that would be particularly useful or timely for your group?
1180	Sara
1181	Bob: Are there any issues that might be useful for your goup that I should address?
1181	Also, I would like to chat with you about settlements on multiple trades.
1181	An interesting issue was raised in our credit lunch last week.
1181	Please let me know when you are available.
1181	Thanks.
1181	Sara
1182	Sheila: Per my voice mail, can you make headway with these two companies?
1182	We have not heard back from either.
1182	I think that there needs to be a commercial push.
1182	Please call if you have any questions or if I can help further.
1182	Thanks.
1182	Sara
1183	Tana: When will the database be ready for companywide access?
1183	Sara
1184	Tana: I added several brokerage agreements to the database yesterday and all ended up in the "Other Agreements" section.
1184	Except for one, which is an "electronic trading agreement".
1184	Can I call our developer?
1184	Thanks.
1184	Sara
1185	Hi, Andrea!
1185	Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by ENA.
1185	I thought these may be useful.
1185	I have forwarded these already to Sami.
1185	Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent English translation of a current deal.
1185	Regards.
1185	Sara
1186	It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these are below.
1186	You can handle the rest, I think.
1186	Also, he jumped on the L/C removal language that we discussed.
1186	[references are to numbered paragraphs below] (2) OK (5) Did you ever receive a response from Rhett?
1186	(7) Per already responded to you.
1186	Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel.
1186	(11) These are two separate issues.
1186	Short of a conversation, it sounds like he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages.
1186	The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination based upon failure to pay.
1186	(12) Need to be consistent for both parties.
1186	(14) Is he right?
1186	(15) Verify with Rod.
1186	(17) I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I?
1186	(19) Check with Rod and I'll also review.
1187	Susan: I have given this to Jason.
1187	SS
1188	David: I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with any questions you may have with respect to the following items: (1) I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return an original to your attention.
1188	Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
1188	(2) The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I could view).
1188	There is no problem with the deal.
1188	(3) As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales as opposed to arbitration?
1188	I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO (Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate jurisdiction.
1188	(4) ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).
1188	I don't know a darn thing about New Guinea law.
1188	Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries?
1188	I'll speak with you later.
1188	Regards.
1188	Sara
1189	Jarrod: Attached is a "form" letter for you to send (with adjustments as indicated) or let me know and I will sign and send with the Vitol confirms.
1189	Separately, I have faxed to you the first page changes.
1189	Call if you have questions.
1189	Please be sure that we have included the additional reps.
1189	Sara
1190	I would only add the ongoing cash collateral issue in Canada (and run spell check).
1191	We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated ISDA definitions.
1191	I think we should work toward replacing this master with an ISDA to eliminate the problem.
1191	We did the same with Aquila which solved the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner than Vitol).
1191	Can someone generate credit?
1191	Thanks.

1192	All: I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document trading.
1192	We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.
1192	The only difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition is done.
1192	The contact is: Gary Ordway Suite 200 Portland, Oregon 97232
1193	You are right!
1193	Sorry about that.
1194	It's true!
1194	I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!
1194	I may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.
1194	But I will call before the weekend.
1194	Sara
1195	Marie is fine with either Friday June 2 or 9.
1195	So let's pick June 2 unless someone has a conflict.
1195	For quick planning (invitations, caterer, limo, etc.), who wants to help?
1195	Sara
1196	Sheila: We are still working with our developer to open up access to Gary's group (read-only).
1196	Should I include all of the names on your February 2000 org chart?
1196	Delete some?
1196	Add some?
1196	Thanks.
1196	Sara
1197	Susan: Would you please handle.
1197	Thanks.
1197	Sara
1198	Rick: With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).
1198	The full set of signature documents comprises four pieces: (1) [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border) (2) Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you] (3) [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex [NOTE: the document contains 12 paragraphs] (4) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you] When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete package with all four parts.
1198	The two emails which you previously received probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally remove this wording.
1198	Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to dot the "i's" and cross the "t's".
1198	Thanks.
1198	Sara
1199	I just learned that I have a conflict on June 2.
1199	So I have already consulted with Marie who has agreed to Friday, June 9.
1199	I hope this works for the majority of the group.
1199	Thanks.
1199	Sara
1200	At end of first paragraph, add: Terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have such meaning as set forth in the Agreement.
1200	Insert in "Credit or Other Special Provisions": On or before 5:00 p.m.
1200	(Houston time) on Wednesday, May 17, 2000, Counterparty shall deliver to ENA Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000 which amount shall be maintained in favor of ENA in accordance with the terms of Annex A to the Agreement and which may be aggregated together with other amounts required for other Transactions subject to the Agreement in order to establish a single Letter of Credit.
1200	Further, at any time during the term of this Transaction, upon the request of ENA in its sole discretion, Counterparty shall deliver additional Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000, subject to the provisions of the foregoing sentence.
1200	In addition to such Performance Assurance, Counterparty shall establish, maintain, renew, substitute and increase such Performance Assurance in accordance with the terms and provisions of Annex A to the Agreement and the failure to do so shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 5A(6) of the Agreement.
1201	not yet
1202	Jarrod: Attached is the price correction language.
1202	There is a 60 day true up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.
1202	Upon notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.
1202	This language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be identical.
1202	We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation.
1202	Please call if you have any questions.
1202	Sara P.S.
1202	you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is for a cross-border transaction
1203	Tana: I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with this form.
1203	The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em (marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed right away.
1203	Clem is going on vacation Friday.
1203	We should also email a copy to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.
1203	PG&E will send execution copies to me.
1203	The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599.
1203	Thanks for your help.
1203	Sara
1204	Monica: Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send me the entire format for the European format for the repos.
1204	Also, have you had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) dated as of January 29, 1998?
1204	I look forward to hearing from you.
1204	Sara
1205	Alan: we are reviewing docs from DLJ, the purchaser of the reference loan.
1206	I'll be here
1207	Jarrod: Just in case you needed the online version of the confirm.
1207	I will fax my markup to you.
1207	Sara
1208	Mark: I've been asked whether ENA can enter into derivatives with an Indian company.
1208	Do you have research regarding legality/enforceability since the 1997 global review which ENA conducted through Allen & Overy?
1208	Thanks.
1208	Sara
1209	Laurel: Can you send the deal ticket for this transaction?
1209	Sara
1210	Rob: Have you ever directly engaged counsel in New Guinea?
1210	I have searched our jurisdictional database but to no avail.
1210	I only find Australian firms with New Guinea associations.
1210	Thanks.
1210	Sara
1211	Just received this on Brazil (financial)
1212	Frank: Have you ever hired New Guinea counsel?
1212	I need to engage a firm to answer derivatives issues.
1212	Thanks.
1212	Sara
1213	Rick: Both Greg and John are traveling.
1213	I did receive a voice mail from John advising that the deal has been delayed.
1213	I don't have details.
1213	John will try to call you.
1213	Thanks.
1213	Sara
1214	Tana: Please provide the following individuals with Lotus Notes access.
1214	Thanks.
1214	Sara
1215	Monica: Thanks for the form.
1215	I can verify that Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., now Enron North America Corp. (by virtue of a name change), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement with The Chase Manhattan Bank dated January 29, 1998.
1215	Please let me know if you need anything further.
1215	Thanks.
1215	Sara
1216	As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley situation: (1) Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. This is the entity for commodity trading.
1216	(i) ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92 (2) Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions (3) Morgan Stanley International Limited This is the entity for equity trading.
1216	Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need this one?
1216	Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.
1216	Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.
1216	Anne Clark in legal (Cap Services) will let me know.
1216	I will put (2) in place.
1216	Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or addressing (3)?
1216	Please let me know.
1216	Thanks.
1216	Sara
1217	Rod: I will contact Frederick Broda (VP, Derivatives and Fixed Income) in NY about this master.
1217	Jeff Nogid requested this master as well.
1217	Thanks.
1217	Sara
1218	Please put on my calendar
1219	Rod: Jeff Nogid has also requested an ISDA Master Agreement with the foregoing party for equity and fixed income deals.
1219	Thanks.
1219	Sara
1220	Mark and Paul: ENA has just finalized an ISDA Master Agreement with Statoil.
1220	I had advised you several months ago that Statoil also wanted to negotiate with ECTRIC, using the ENA agreement as a model.
1220	Chuck O'Brien is the inhouse counsel and can be reached via email or phone (203/978-6988).
1220	Please contact Chuck and let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.
1220	Regards.
1220	Sara Chuck: Mark and Paul can be reached in London at 011-44-20-7783-6552 (Mark) and 011-44-20-7783-6566 (Paul).
1221	Jarrod: attached are comments to the confirm.
1221	Please note that you must reference the KPM transaction in the Additional Provisions section, part (iv).
1221	Sara
1222	Michael and Deepak: Attached are the execution copies of the documents signed with ENA.
1222	If I have missed anything, please contact Susan Flynn (as Marie Heard is now with EBS).
1222	Thanks.
1222	Sara
1223	Rod: attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s group.
1223	I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it was minimal.
1223	How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?
1223	Also, do we want agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding, Inc.)?
1223	Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?
1223	Please call to chat when you have a chance.
1223	Thanks.
1223	Sara
1224	Shari: I see that you added this to the legal/credit list.
1224	Can you tell me why?
1224	What type of deal do we do?
1224	Did ECTI ever transact with DLJ Capital Funding, Inc. (for distressed loans)?
1224	Are you familiar with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. "standard terms and conditions"?
1224	Did you ever document a loan derivative?
1224	Thanks.
1224	Sara
1225	Please add to the list of masters to be drafted.
1225	Thanks.
1225	Sara
1226	Mark: Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and Texaco to create a JV called BL.
1226	I believe that the ownership is 60/40, respectively.
1226	BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.
1226	The swap group has already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, authorized trader lists, etc. Before the closing, there was an "understanding" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 2000).
1226	However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person run through an entire budget).
1226	Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 20 ISDA's).
1226	By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we have no one to negotiate with!
1226	BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.
1226	Are you interested in pursuing this request?
1226	Sara
1227	Carol: Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.
1227	I have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience in the confirmation area).
1227	What do you think?
1227	Sara
1228	Carol: I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.
1228	Prior to the departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten the confirms considerably.
1228	Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted in the annex.
1228	Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.
1228	I think it's a great idea.
1228	Jarrod will also send the existing weather templates (which may be slightly different from those Shari gave us earlier).
1228	We should verify that the weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to remove that rep from the Schedule).
1228	Also, shouldn't we verify that all weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?
1228	Sara
1229	Kelly: ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX trading through the Bank One broker.
1229	Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard Master Note with Bank One?
1229	I'd like to see what's been previously negotiated.
1229	Thanks.
1229	Sara
1230	Please remove Mark Taylor from the distribution list and insert my name and email address.
1230	Thank you.
1231	I have two questions: (1) If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, won't Greg Johnston need a "short course" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?
1231	I was thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.
1231	(2) Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?
1231	I'm not sure if Tana has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch.
1232	Anne: Thanks for your voice mail.
1232	We would like to generate the master.
1232	I'll try to have it emailed on Monday.
1232	Regards.
1232	Sara
1233	Maryann: I left you a voice mail the other day regarding two typos in the agreement and never received corrected pages.
1233	The Guarantee has been executed.
1233	However, the agreement is awaiting the initials of Rod Nelson (credit) who is on vacation until Wednesday.
1233	Will you send corrected pages for insertion in the document?
1234	Frank: Have you had any luck?
1234	Sara
1235	Susan: I am told that the name of the Enron company is "Enron Investments PLC" and Lance Schuler set it up for the acquisition.
1235	Please check on corporate database.
1235	I'll try to get you a contact.
1235	SS
1236	Susan: We are going to open a futures account with Bank One.
1236	They have also sent a give up agreement.
1236	This message is FYI.
1237	Jason: Please review (I have others for you to see).
1237	Also, Paul and I spoke with Cadwalader this morning.
1237	Please continue to check the international exchanges online to see if you can locate clearinhouse rules for each exchange.
1237	Perhaps you can also find information on the regulatory scheme for the jurisdictions.
1237	I suspect we will have to hire outside counsel in each country to answer our concerns.
1237	Let's talk.
1237	SS
1238	All: Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive the shares of the above entity.
1238	I can't locate the company on the corporate database.
1238	My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).
1238	CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a subaccount for EIplc.
1238	However, two (2) items are required: (1) a letter of beneficiary ownership (2) Is EIplc a regulated UK company?
1238	If the answer is no, then it (or the company reporting for it) must provide a net asset valuation Has someone in London already handled these issues?
1238	If not, can one of you supply me with that information?
1238	We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in Thanks for your help.
1238	Sara
1239	Sure, later today?
1240	Mark and Paul: Have either of you ever reviewed clearinghouse rules with respect to clearing members for the exhanges on which we trade (in an effort to analyze our risk with respect to our brokers)?
1240	If the answer is yes, could I have copies of any memoranda?
1240	Please let me hear from you or whomever may have reviewed this issue.
1240	Thank you.
1240	Sara
1241	Susan: We need to set up this account for funding on or before 5/30.
1241	Please call our rep at Morgan and let's get the paperwork signed.
1241	Sara
1242	I have a standing meeting at that time but I don't need to be on the call.
1242	Thanks.
1242	Sara
1243	Sheila: I received a requst from you.
1243	Please advise if: (1) You sent explanation to Ted Murphy stating purpose for account.
1243	(2) Agreement reflect DB Alex Brown LLC to clear trades with prime broker of our choice (3) Why is this a Deutsche Bank agreement?
1243	Who is "Frost Securities, Inc."?
1243	(4) Do we contact "Janet" at 214/515-4495 with markup?
1244	FYI - thought you'd find this interesting.
1244	ss
1245	FYI
1246	FYI
1247	Jarrod: So what's the latest with Aquila?
1247	We may have our master signed soon.
1247	Sara
1248	Tana: Please review these pages for corrections and insert into original.
1248	Rod should return tomorrow and we can execute and FedEx to PG&E.
1248	Thanks.
1248	Sara
1249	Donna: It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies of existing brokerage accounts.
1249	It has also been determined (in legal) that the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A. I have some temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here for another few weeks.
1249	I was hoping that we could all meet and put our "project" into action.
1249	Please give me a call and suggest some time when we may meet.
1249	Thanks.
1249	Sara
1250	Michael and Deepak: Michael Moulton (the ENA paper and pulp trader) is extremely interested in SITA updates as often as possible.
1250	Please make every effort to email Michael with updates at least weekly.
1250	Thanks.
1250	Sara
1251	Michael: Attached is FYI.
1251	Also, I am going to pay you a visit shortly to discuss the confirm.
1251	Sara
1252	All: I received a phone call from Gary Ordway asking when he could receive draft documentation.
1252	Has anyone prepared credit?
1252	Thanks.
1252	Sara
1253	Susan: Here is the latest comment from Michael regarding the negotiations.
1253	We should keep Lotus Notes updated.
1253	Thanks.
1253	Sara
1254	no
1255	Rod and Susan: The CP's lawyer asked for a new draft so we can redraft on our new form.
1255	Unless Rod objects, we will use the same credit.
1255	Rod, there will be cross default and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we can discuss when CP returns comments.
1255	Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and she would like to be copied on the redraft.
1255	Thanks.
1255	Sara
1256	Susan: Yet another name to deal with!
1256	It appears that Paul opened my original memo a day late.
1256	Sara
1257	Carol: Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?
1257	I don't want to duplicate work efforts.
1257	Maybe you and I can chat during the time originally set aside for Richard (this morning).
1257	Thanks.
1257	Sara
1258	Shari: When you get back after vacation and have caught up, give me a call to chat about the NYISO pricing.
1258	Elizabeth suggested that we coordinate our efforts to capture extreme pricing revisions and negative pricing issues.
1258	Our power confirms currently include a modified version of Section 7.3 (of the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions) in our omnibus confirms for price changes.
1258	I am still tracking third party paper.
1258	Thanks.
1258	Sara
1259	Please prepare the ISDA as requested.
1259	Sara
1260	What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?
1261	Hey, Rod: Clint has trashed Lehman Bros. (for the moment) and is doing the deal with MLI.
1261	So, today we confirm the trade on a Deemed ISDA and have agreed to sign an ISDA within 20 days.
1261	Would you please prepare a credit worksheet and send it down so that we can get started?
1261	Please note that we agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.
1261	Also, you left the chart for the PATS-2000 deal in my office (you, bum!).
1261	I do ask that you let me review this with you so that you can evaluate the credit risk.
1261	Thanks.
1261	Sara
1262	Susan: Here's a heads up.
1262	I haven't read the messge and don't know the timing.
1262	I 'll sort throught it later today.
1262	ss
1263	Mark: Please verify for me that you told Susan F. that Samantha would be responsible for the brokerage accounts when she joins us.
1263	I wasn't certain that Susan knew and I didn't want to spring it on her.
1263	Thanks.
1263	Sara
1264	Gareth: My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.
1264	Please note that UBS is aware of the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was attached to the original fax).
1264	The confirms are pretty straightforward.
1264	(1) Is the Trust an eligible swap participant?
1264	(2) The Schedule is missing some "standard" Enron type provisions (which were in the Swiss Bank master).
1264	These include: limitation of liability confidentiality setoff isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?
1264	this could impact our approach.
1264	(3) Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).
1264	Enron's preference is arbitration.
1264	With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).
1264	In the Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere.
1264	(4) Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?
1264	If the Trust intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.
1264	What eventually happens to the Trust?
1264	Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS.
1264	Call if you need anything else.
1264	Sara
1265	Susan: would you please contact this party to see if they have comments?
1265	Jennifer says they are ready to sign.
1265	We are having a guaranty problem and that's why this party has come up.
1265	Please let Souad know what the response is.
1265	Thanks.
1265	Sara
1266	Marty: I'll call you after lunch.
1266	Thanks.
1266	Sara
1267	Jarrod: It's attached.
1267	Insert the fallback and it sounds like we delete the Credit etc.
1268	WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
1268	HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH THIS GUY?
1268	Sara
1269	Kaye: I would like to schedule a meeting for sometime after June 8 (when our new paralegal Samantha arrives) with Donna and Samantha.
1269	We will need a conference room.
1269	1 hour.
1269	Taffy has Samantha's schedule.
1269	I know she has orientation on June 8.
1269	If Tana is "training" on June 9, 10, etc., I could borrow 1 hour.
1269	Thanks.
1269	Sara
1270	Carol: FYI - this is a Top Ten.
1270	There are no entries in Lotus Notes since 5/5/00.
1270	Hope you had a nice weekend.
1270	Sara
1271	Melissa: We need to meet again about the templates.
1271	Also, what is this about?
1271	And we have to talk about Deseret.
1271	Thanks.
1271	Sara
1272	Kaye: Can you print a list of the documents in my folders so that I can eliminate old items?
1272	Also, am I still subject to the "backup" of documents?
1273	Rod: Forgive my redundancy, but did I already request (and did you send) a credit worksheet for this counterparty?
1273	This is another Clint Freeland/Jeff Nogid push for Fastow.
1273	Thanks.
1273	Sara
1274	Jeff and Larry: Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master Agreements.
1274	The summary was divided into two parts: "Without Master Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of trades for the first half of the year.
1274	It is our objective once again to put new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA Master Agreements.
1274	I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll leave that to your discretion).
1274	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1274	Thanks.
1274	Sara P.S.
1274	We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's list!
1275	Jarrod: Please let me know when you have received the deemed ISDA doc.
1275	SS
1276	FYI: Michael is on a two week honeymoon.
1276	Good luck staying on top of these guys!
1276	Sara
1277	FYI
1278	Rod: Further to my recent memo, the Tokheim debt is being transferred to DLJ (and we owe Deutsche Bank for the unwind of the loan swap).
1278	Sara P.S.
1278	Who will handle credit derivatives in your absence?
1279	Carol: I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to Marie.
1279	In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina Tice, the CP credit manager.
1279	Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on top of Brant.
1279	Your name is on this one.
1279	Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.
1279	Although Richard inquired about Palladium.
1279	I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week (according to Tanya).
1279	Sara
1280	Rod: And what lawyer is handling this in your presence?
1280	This is beginning to sound like Koch and all of the Koch separate trading entities!!!!
1280	My brain is full now.
1281	I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see attached message below).
1281	When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.
1281	I am assuming that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement between our respective companies.
1281	If not, please let me know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.
1281	On April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy price swap agreements.
1281	Since our companies are currently trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.
1281	This relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our weather trades.
1281	Please let me hear from you.
1281	You can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).
1282	Kaye: Please schedule about an hour with Elsa Piekielniak (X37613) in my office to discuss "new products, per her voice mail".
1282	Thanks.
1282	SS
1283	WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
1284	Bill: I'll call you on Thursday, June 1 at 2pm MST.
1284	Thanks.
1284	Sara
1285	All: I know that credit and legal are currently stretched to the limits but pushing your credit priorities will require some coordination.
1285	Here's a brief recap of yesterday's meeting: ALMOST DONE: Cargill, Idacorp, Utilicorp BRANT: Dynegy Canada, Occidental, Duke Energy Marketing Limited P'p RUSSELL: PanCanadian Energy Services, WPS Energy Services TANYA: J.Aron (we need commercial help to push this) Please review the comments taken at each meeting and distributed to everyone.
1285	Please use Lotus Notes to record/review activity.
1285	We are depending on you to take needed action as required and we are doing the same.
1285	Thanks.
1285	Sara
1286	Tanya: Please talk to either Carol or Tana.
1286	Maybe they need commercial help to get the guaranty.
1286	SS
1287	Tanya: Please see Vitol response below.
1287	Do you generate the credit worksheet?
1287	How does London credit fit in here?
1287	Another interesting feature here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol isn't a bank, or is it?).
1287	I have never seen this utilized in practice for a non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.
1287	There is very little written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is because it has been understood as applying to banks.
1287	However, would this master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?
1287	Sara
1288	Tanya: another Vitol message
1289	You'd better be back in town!
1289	Sara
1290	Thank you for the confirmation.
1290	I assume that I am not charged until you ship.
1290	Is this correct?
1291	Paul: We'll await your credit worksheets to begin preparing the ISDA's.
1291	Thanks.
1291	Sara
1292	Hi, Susan.
1292	Just to let you know that I will have the agreements executed by ENA once you have initialled and returned them to me.
1292	Thanks.
1292	Sara
1293	No credit support annex.
1293	Enron Corp. guaranty capped at $25 million.
1293	That's the latest (for Lehman, etc.)
1294	Kaye: Will you please print these docs for me?
1294	Thanks.
1294	Sara
1295	Kaye: Will you please print these as well?
1296	Paul: I finally got your address right!
1296	Why are YOU listed in the Enron Corp. address book?
1296	Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT directory!
1296	I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.
1296	He will prepare a short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of this week or early next week.
1296	Then we can decide whether additional conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.
1296	Also, please send credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.
1296	They divide up the booty.
1296	We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.
1296	She will eventually be thrown into the fray.
1296	We'll be sending a new message to everyone in credit soon.
1296	Thanks for your help.
1296	Sara
1297	Susan: The docs are in my "in box".
1297	I haven't reviewed and need to speak with Sheila (or have you already contacted her?).
1297	I don't know the timing for this transaction.
1297	How long will it take to open the account?
1297	Feel free to grab the docs.
1297	SS
1298	Ted: ENA, formerly Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., opened a futures account with Cargill in 1993.
1298	I am advised that there has not been any activity with Cargill for many months.
1298	It appears that we had subaccounts for trading crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.
1298	We do not have any margin residing with Cargill.
1298	Given our recent discussions regarding inactive equity accounts, I was wondering if you had given any thought to inactive futures accounts.
1298	As of 5/23/00, I see only 13 active futures accounts.
1298	The following accounts appear to be dormant: (1) Bank One - I am currently negotiating to open up a margin line (2) Cargill (3) Daiwa Securities America (4) Gerald Inc. (may have merged or business moved to another firm) (5) Merrill Lynch Futures (6) Paine Webber (7) OM Stockholm (paper) (8) Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Please let me know what action you would like to take, if any, or discuss in general.
1298	Thanks.
1298	Sara
1299	Susan: Please send to Peter Bar (he's the trader) at Merrill: You can call him to see if you should also send to a lawyer, probably Gary Rosenblum.
1299	Peter's phone number is 212-449-6763.
1299	His fax is 212-738-1069.
1299	Also, I had opened a Lotus Notes entry to begin capturing information.
1299	You will need to delete one of the entries.
1299	Thanks.
1299	Sara
1300	Martin: I wasn't certain if I sent you an email earlier today, but I am in need of current information regarding Swedish law, in connection with an ENA swap with a Swedish corporate.
1300	I faxed our counsel (from the 1996 derivatives survey) Advokatfirman Vinge KB to inquire about the enforceability of arbitration in ISDA agreements between US and Swedish parties.
1300	Do you know the answer?
1300	Or do you have any other suggestions?
1300	We did a trade yesterday and I'm trying to document using a deemed ISDA.
1300	I appreciate any help.
1300	Regards.
1300	Sara
1301	Kaye: Attached is my message from Tuesday.
1301	Also, please schedule an hour in my office with Melissa Murphy (31886) to discuss power confirms.
1301	SS
1302	John: Per my voice mail.
1302	Please call.
1302	Sara
1303	Susan: Please let me review changes to docs.
1303	When will this go out the the counterparty?
1303	Sara
1304	Mark: I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.
1304	I am attending a wedding Friday night.
1304	I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.
1304	Also, did you receive my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?
1304	I'd like to finalize this agreement.
1304	Thanks.
1304	Sara
1305	FYI
1306	Taffy: Did you ever deliver a recap of our Tuesday meeting to legal and credit?
1306	Sara
1307	Tanya: my mistake.
1307	I'll put back on.
1307	We've signed; it's their paper.
1307	Sara
1308	Melissa: Attached is my version.
1308	Please call if you have any questions.
1308	SS
1309	FYI
1310	Rod: I spoke with Merrill legal and the biggest issue is the capped guaranty (particularly since Merrill expected Enron Corp. to be the counterparty) .
1310	Please call Peter Barna to discuss at 212-449-6763.
1310	Thanks.
1310	Sara
1311	I will be leaving the office at approx.
1311	3:45 pm.
1311	If we need to meet, please see me before that time.
1311	Sara
1312	Susan: Fred says to send to Jerry Brunner, PO BX 737, Ignacio, CO 81127 phone is 970-563-0140 Does Suttle have another contact?
1313	FYI - the following list reflects old ECT master and no master counterparties by volume (not necessarily exposure).
1313	Sara Tanya: do you want all of these names on the legal/credit list?
1314	Susan: Please put in file and note changes on our paperwork.
1314	SS ps Did the merger trigger anything in the agreement?
1315	Melissa: Brant Reves has just confirmed for me that financial power deals in the name of Aquila will change to Utilicorp United Inc. when the ISDA Master is signed (any day now).
1315	Of course, the confirm will be an ISDA confirm, as well.
1315	SS
1316	Susan: you need to log this in. I'm leaving early today.
1316	SS
1317	In the interest of time, I have revised our draft ISDA Schedule to conform in most material respects to the 1994 (effective 1992) agreement executed between ERMS and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. ("Old ISDA").
1317	This was done to accommadate the Merrill lawyer, Gary Rosenblum (who didn't want to read our Schedule!).
1317	The Old ISDA is not identical to the format used by Merrill Lynch International today so I'm not sure how hard they will press for other changes.
1317	There are two potential credit issues that I see: (1) agreement as to the Enron Corp. guaranty cap (and possible Merrill Lynch guaranty cap) and (2) our introduction of a MAC provision in the form of an Additional Event of Default (necessary because the Old ISDA had a Credit Support Annex and this one does not).
1317	I left a voice mail for Gary Rosenblum and asked that he let me know when he was available on Monday to talk AND to have his credit person contact Rod Nelson.
1317	Sara P.S.
1317	I haven't heard from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company or Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.
1318	Kaye: Please print this message and documents.
1318	SS
1319	Tracy Ngo, Melissa Murphy, Kim Theriot, me to discuss financial power trading counterparties.
1319	Please ask Tracy if Ed Sacks or anyone else from credit should be included.
1320	Carol: Here's my "short" list of issues for Mark: (1) Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7: (a) reiterate "rules" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works and what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.) (b)paralegal workload (2) Confirmations and need to create a "writing" multiple confirms with the same counterparty confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
1320	use of confirms with negative language (3) Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands (4) Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants (5) Method for shortening weather confirms (6) Mary and Brent - possible work assignments
1321	Yes, please.
1322	Lisa: per your voice mail, I am sending the ballot to your office for review.
1322	Thanks.
1322	Sara
1323	Do I have to think?
1323	Well, I say let's do it.
1323	We'll have to monitor and if he is ever ineligible, we can cancel the agreement.
1323	Of course, we can always decide to not transact.
1323	SS
1324	The saga continues
1325	FYI - Leslie drafted language (based on ISDA) some time ago.
1325	I just want to be consistent.
1325	I left Leslie a vm.
1325	SS
1326	Melissa: I've revised your list slightly for my purposes.
1326	Can you take a quick look?
1326	We can refine the format tomorrow.
1326	Thanks.
1326	Sara p.s.
1326	It sure looks like a lot of people have their hands on the "power correction language".
1326	I'm meeting with Tom May this afternoon.
1327	Susan: Based on Tanya's message, we should pursue the Morgan Cap Services agreement.
1327	Let's talk when you have a chance.
1327	I've put this on our
1328	Taffy: Are we on Mark's schedule today?
1328	Thanks.
1328	Sara
1329	I spoke with the Lehman lawyer who will call me back this evening with comments.
1329	Rod: Daniel Goldhagen is their credit officer.
1330	FYI - let's chat and decide where to go from here.
1330	Sara
1331	Edmund: I gather from Paul Radous that these are both ECTRIC ISDA masters and transactions.
1331	I have a November 11,1999 South African derivatives questionnaire (from Webber Wentzel Bowens).
1331	Would you like to have a copy?
1331	Sara
1332	John: What's happening here?
1332	Sara
1333	Brant: Is this really high priority (for our legal/credit discussions)?
1333	We haven't heard from these guys since April 13.
1333	Sara
1334	Rod: What's going on with this dudes?
1334	They just sent me a huge agreement relating to their arrangement with the International Finance Corp. and hedging agreements.
1334	Sara
1335	For ALL options for this party, we need to revise the opening sentence to read: "... the terms and conditions of the Transaction ... on the Trade Date specified below (the "Transaction") which is an option offered by Small Ventures USA, LLC to ENA, and accepted by ENA, pursuant to a telephone conversation between the parties."
1336	I believe this to be true.
1336	I spoke with the Utilicorp lawyer when I documented the "Australian" weather trade and discussed transfer of the weather deal to the new master.
1336	We should talk to our Aquila trader.
1337	Stewart: I'll have to review their master to be certain (and insure that there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions).
1337	In general, there is nothing else required specifically, although we may have to add some language to the weather confirmations themselves.
1337	Sara
1338	Please see attached.
1338	Also, I need to speak with you about brokerage business - it's exceeding swap/derivative work.
1338	Sara
1339	Foiled again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1340	You're always sending me stuff
1341	FYI.
1341	Also, I'll look at the agreement.
1341	Sara
1342	Jason: fyi.
1342	Also, Randy Curry did call me yesterday but wasn't available when I returned the call.
1342	Also, let's get Sakura Dellsher executed (and we should create a file since we're noting the ADM agreement which we did for Bridgeline).
1342	Could we please talk this afternoon about outstanding agreements?
1342	ss
1343	All: please see the attached.
1343	Also, I left a detailed message for Lauren Hagerty last night but haven't anything.
1343	Sara
1344	Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.
1344	We're very close.
1344	Tanya: Can you tell me what products we trade?
1344	Are there many outstanding transactions?
1344	Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is current.
1344	It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry Donovan!!!!!).
1344	This must be wrong.
1345	Susan: Please fax a copy of Rule 35.1(b)(2) to James Coiley (outside counsel).
1345	Thanks.
1345	Sara
1346	Carol: John sent the email to all paralegals after he and I spoke in the morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.
1346	I remember, now, I checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister ( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle this one.
1346	I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd have enough time to review.
1346	The rest is history.
1346	Sara
1347	The AAA program was Credit Lyonnais.
1348	I will have to leave shortly before 5 pm on Thursday.
1348	Also, on Friday, I will have to leave around 4 pm to be home for the FOOD delivery!
1349	This is the account we can begin working on now.
1349	We need to meet (maybe you can drop by).
1349	Sara
1350	FYI
1351	I'll get to this later today.
1351	Call if you have immediate issues.
1351	Sara
1352	David: check out the second attachment.
1352	Thanks, as always.
1352	Sara
1353	I haven't forgotten.
1353	We've been short staffed and swamped.
1353	Sara
1354	We are in the process of auditing/monitoring all accounts.
1354	It is possible that after due notice, we will commence with the closure of unutilized account.s.
1354	Please call if you have any questions.
1354	Sara
1355	Please print out the "swap" documents for me ASAP.
1355	Thanks.
1355	Sara
1356	FYI - this may be a duplicate
1357	please print from SWAP 1 to the end.
1357	Thanks.
1357	SS
1358	Jen: This is a good question and I think that the PG&E lawyer may be confused here with instructions to her traders.
1358	The PG&E trader can call either an ECC or ENA trader BUT a transaction will ALWAYS be booked and confirmed in the name of ENA under the executed ENA ISDA Master Agreement with PG&E.
1358	For internal purposes, the trade will either remain on an ENA book or backed to an ECC book.
1358	I hope this answers your question.
1358	Sara
1359	David: Thank you for the email.
1359	I left a message for you to call (let me know what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to make the language generic enough to include all future products which might fall into this category.
1359	We considered the following: Alternative 1: "For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives Alternative 2: "For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; .
1359	.
1359	.
1359	" We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. "including but not limited to paper and pulp"). Also, "newer market" may not mean illiquid. "No market" could mean that we are the only market maker. Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a separate writing. Can we please discuss? I am free all afternoon. Thanks. Sara
1360	We are continuing to send Deemed ISDA's to this entity (periodically) and have transacted with other Glencore entities in the past.
1360	I would like to generate a draft ISDA and send to these guys because it will make our life easier (and we say as much in a Deemed ISDA).
1360	Thanks.
1360	Sara
1361	Gary: I believe we are having our guaranty executed.
1361	We haven't seen the draft of yours.
1361	Please send ASAP.
1361	How long will it take for you to execute?
1361	Sara
1362	Can you supply with an addressee list for potential closure of ANY futures accounts?
1362	There are currently about seven inactive accounts for all types of commodities.
1362	Thanks.
1362	Sara
1363	Jaime: When speaking with you earlier, I completely forgot to mention that Carol St. Clair (Ext. 33989) will be addressing EOL issues arising in connection with Enron Mexico Corp. Please forgive me.
1363	I know that Carol is trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in Mexico.
1363	It may be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals, etc. for her to include in her discussions.
1363	I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.
1363	Please let me hear from you and I look forward to meeting with you later this week.
1363	Regards.
1363	Sara
1364	Please let me know if the attached guaranty is identical to the original incoming guaranty in the other Merrill file.
1364	We're trying to execute today or tomorrow.
1365	Yes, my other question to Gary was HOW QUICKLY can you have the guaranty executed.
1366	Susan: this guaranty came from the lawyer.
1366	Use this instead of the earlier version.
1366	SS
1367	Jaime: Carol and I are available on Tuesday, June 13 from 10 am - 11:45 am and after 3 pm.
1367	Please let us hear from you (and who should initiate the call).
1367	Thanks.
1367	Sara
1368	This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for governmental entities.
1368	I believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between "First Method" (one-way payments) and "Second Method" (two-way payments) for Early Termination purposes.
1368	Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a governmental.
1368	The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.
1368	For those of you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.
1368	Because these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.
1368	The Part 5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.
1368	It was included in the "Event of Change" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the ISDA concept of "Illegality", a "Termination Event").
1368	I think it was probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT form.
1369	FYI
1370	Sheetal: Please note that ENA will ALWAYS want to include an Annex B with this Counterparty.
1370	Legal will need to review each time.
1370	Thanks.
1370	Sara
1371	Susan: (1) We need to have the following agreement with Goldman re-executed.
1371	I have the prior agreement in my office (if you want it).
1371	Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa.
1371	Please add this to the equity list.
1371	(2) I will give you Direct Trading for execution.
1371	It should also be added to the equity list.
1371	(3) I think we need to add a reference to the First Boston Enron Corp. account to the equity list.
1372	legal/credit meeting - please verify conference room
1373	We do not have any executed docs to send to Morgan Stanley to open the account.
1373	Lauren is awaiting signatures.
1373	Ted Murphy is the only signature required outside the India group.
1373	Morgan will open the account with faxed signatures.
1373	Did Anthony ever give you an account number?
1373	Sara
1374	Lauren spoke with Anthony last night - all is calm.
1374	Sheila will track down an account number.
1374	Lauren will deliver docs to you today and we will need Ted's signature.
1374	We can send out the package tonight.
1374	One of Anthony's assistants is handling today.
1374	By the way, Enron India LLC recieved the largest share of the IPO.
1374	There are problems with the other the other India account.
1375	Will you please contact them again.
1375	SS
1376	We're almost ready - a few more minutes
1377	forget the earlier message.
1377	this is it
1378	Bob: Hope all is well.
1378	Per my voice mail, attached is the confirm.
1378	I'm trying to refresh my knowledge of equity derivatives and securities issues (for ENE).
1378	You can reach me at 713/853-5620.
1378	Let me know what your schedule looks like.
1378	It's looking like a wave of equity deals is coming my way.
1378	Thanks.
1378	Sara
1379	Carol: What's this about?
1380	Susan: will you please handle.
1380	Thanks.
1380	Sara
1381	FYI
1382	Paul: I think you are trying to avoid me!
1382	Hope all is well and you are just overworked and overwhelmed.
1382	I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is located in London.
1382	In connection with that group's activities, I have some questions and all fingers point to you.
1382	(1) Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit derivative transactions (including your online "bankruptcy swap") in the US?
1382	I am sure that you've already explored the "insurance" issue and I don't want to duplicate reasearch, if possible.
1382	(2) What forms have you devised?
1382	Are they online?
1382	Should I just grab a password?
1382	(3) Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?
1382	Is trading in credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of derivatives?
1382	I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in "securites" for that exam to be necessary.
1382	(4) Where is enroncredit.com headed?
1382	I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.

1384	I will be on vacation on Friday, June 30.

1385	Rod: I'm thinking ahead with respect to Enron Corp./Hickerson matters.
1385	A few current issues include: (1) Nogid/Freeland seem to be entering into more equity swaps.
1385	I have asked that copes of all equity transactions be forwarded to my attention immediately.
1385	The first order of business includes transacting with the following parties in the following order: 1.
1385	Credit Suisse First Boston ("CSFB").
1385	We have an ECT ISDA with Credit Suisse Financial Products which I believe is the predecessor to CSFB.
1385	Can you verify?
1385	Do we need to amend or create a new master?
1385	2.
1385	Bear Stearns (I believe that it will be Bear Stearns International Limited because equities are done offshore) 3.
1385	Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. (you already provided credit) Please let me know about 1 and 2 above.
1385	(2) Credit derivatives and distressed loan transactions On May 18, 2000, I provided you with a list of the types of transactions originating in Kinneman's group by ECT Investments.
1385	Do these guys ever need to communicate with credit?
1385	How do you monitor?
1385	Please let me know who I should be speaking with about these transactions.
1386	Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F. and Tana an expression of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?
1386	I was thinking that a gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift products, etc.) and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate their efforts.
1386	Sara
1387	I made some changes to the language below assuming use for an ISDA.
1387	My onlproblem is that I am not certain that the IPE description is what we use (I'll defer to your verification) but it appears each monthly calculationincorporates pricing from three different delivery month contracts.
1387	Sara P.S.
1387	I would like a copy of the Platt's marketwire if you can locate
1388	Don't worry - I already spoke to Souad.
1388	SS Carol St Clair To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: IPE Brent language Sara: This is Greek to me.
1388	Can you help?
1388	carol
1389	I'll be reachable all afternoon at (713) 664-3207.
1389	Please feel free to call me.
1389	Thanks.
1389	Sara
1390	The market for this Transaction is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets and, accordingly, this Transaction may be subject to greater risk than other derivatives transactions.
1390	This should be added to the confirm as: (i) numbered paragraph 2 for the ISDA confirm (ii) the second sentence (opening paragraph) of the omnibus
1391	I guess you know that Mark was inquiring as to who had ordered these.
1391	I'd like a copy of the Japanese materials.
1391	thanks.
1391	Sara
1392	Mark: In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on finalizing/redistributing her workload?
1392	I have lots of questions which I'm sure can't be answered this minute, such as: Shouldn't we help to prioritize her work?
1392	Will she continue day-to-day work?
1392	Who will take confirm desk calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be involved now), etc. Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".
1392	Thanks.
1392	Sara
1393	All: Attached are Bob's comments.
1393	I have not yet reviewed but will do soshortly.
1393	We're making progress on the masters.
1393	And it will be important ttrack ALL EQUITY CONFIRMATIONS.
1393	I would appreciate your advising me whenever Enron Corp. transacts derivatives/forwards, whether in the name of Enron Corp. or ENA, on a timely basis.
1393	This will obvioiusly eliminate delays inreviewing the language and will make it easier to speak with both Rex andBob.
1393	Thanks.
1393	Sara
1394	Hi, Patricia!
1394	Just thought I'd drop you a quick note to see what you might have available by Maxwell Hendler.
1394	I understand that you had a recent show of his work.
1394	Please drop me an email or you can reach me at work (713) 853-5620.
1394	Mike and I still think about "Tangee", "Aqua Pool", etc. I hope you are doing well and we look forward to returning to L.A. soon.
1394	Thanks very much.
1394	Regards.
1394	Sara
1395	per my voice mail
1396	Attached are the two (2) sets of assignments with attached trade descriptions.
1396	(1) the first set (first two docs) is an assignment of trades between ENA and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc. subject to the ISDA which we are now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades] (2) the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc. I have no idea where this came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.
1396	Who is verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?
1396	Presently, the assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm will be governed by the Master]
1397	Tana: Jason still does not have access to the Financial Trading dababase.
1397	Can you facilitate please?
1397	thanks.
1397	Sara
1398	Jim: We are still trying to resolve the ISDA issues.
1398	On a slightly different note, could you please send me copies of the executed confirmations for the five trades that HSES has with J. Aron?
1398	My fax number is (713) 646-3490.
1398	Thanks.
1398	Sara
1399	Jason: Please stay in touch with Sarah.
1399	We really do need to finalize with Bank One by Friday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400	Hi, Shari: Carol told me that you and Peggy have some memoranda addressing the validity of local derivatives trading in Mexico.
1400	I would appreciate copies.
1400	Do I need to also place these in our legal opinion database?
1400	Thanks.
1400	Sara
1401	Jim: I couldn't tell if you received this message.
1401	Sara
1402	Mark: ENA is looking into derivatives trading with an Indian corporate.
1402	My latest information is the opinion from 1/14/97 rendered by Crawford Bayley & Co. (which was part of our global survey effort a few years ago).
1402	Do you have anything more recent?
1402	The ENA inquiry came from the pulp and paper group.
1402	Thanks for your help.
1402	Sara
1403	fyi.
1403	also, I just spoke with Sarah Wesner (ext. 35261) who will coordinate with you.
1403	You can review the note with her and let's talk about their guaranty (will our guaranty format work?).
1403	Also, I'm almost inclined to go with their commitment letter (if revised) in lieu of a lengthier agreement.
1404	Paul: Please see below.
1404	How serious is this inquiry as it will require some work on the legal side?
1404	Sara
1405	fyi (I've asked Sheila to add your name to the list).
1405	Sara
1406	Thanks for the heads up.
1406	Also, please add Samantha Boyd to the list since she will be assisting us with these accounts.
1406	Thanks.
1406	Sara
1407	HS Energy Services docs
1408	FYI
1409	Susan: Steve Morus called and would like for you to email to him the schedule/CSA for comment.
1409	Info already in database.
1409	Thanks.
1409	Sara
1410	Pushkar: Here's the language suggested by Merrill for use in NDF's.
1410	I am not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill in the blanks.
1410	I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.
1410	Thanks.
1410	Sara
1411	Sheila: Looks like Rafael never read the email that Susan Flynn sent to Nancy a few days ago.
1411	I don't know where this stands.
1411	Sara
1412	Susan and Susan: Please let me know who will handle.
1412	I am holding the confirm.
1412	Sara
1413	Please let me review final changes.
1413	Sara
1414	Tanya: I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade TODAY.
1414	We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).
1414	Please note that Enron Corp. previously provided a guaranty.
1414	I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.
1414	Will ENA provide a parent guaranty for the new transaction?
1414	Please let me know.
1414	Thanks.
1414	Sara
1415	Joe: Attached in draft form is a transaction that Chris Foster may do with Arco today.
1415	His number in Portland is 834-3822.
1415	I'm not certain about credit and "ECT" will have to change to "ENA".
1415	Let's keep in touch.
1415	Thanks.
1415	Sara
1416	Jarrod: attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp omnibus confirms (and Bob has reviewed this language): Also, attached is the Temple-Inland confirm and I have changed only the "Credit or Other Special Provisions" paragraph.
1416	You will have to attach Exhibit "A" (which Susan sent you last week).
1416	P.S.
1416	Please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty.
1416	I believe that Paul told me by Wednesday.
1417	Tana: Please see that Jeff Nogid and Clint Freeland are given access to our Financial Trading Agreements database.
1417	Thanks.
1417	Sara
1418	Global Finance
1419	Susan: Steve Morus called again and asked that you please email the Schedule/CSA for comment.
1419	Thanks.
1419	Sara
1420	attached are comments (and note that you do not need the defined term "Agreement" in the opening paragraph: I do not understand your "Notice of Exercise" because it describes an option to extend. Please call.
1421	You are most welcome.
1421	Hope the food is as good as the OTHER get together.
1421	SS
1422	When will you have some time to discuss (a) templates and (b) short dated trades?
1423	Kevin: We are holding up the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement until you finalize your piece.
1423	The DATE of the earliest trade between ENA and HS Resources is important because we will use that date for the ISDA.
1423	Please verify that date as soon as possible.
1423	Thanks.
1423	Sara
1424	Susan: Which Paribas are you referring to?
1425	please call.
1425	I'd like copy of final Media General.
1425	Also, we need to discuss the notice.
1425	sara
1426	Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.
1426	From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third party.
1426	Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering into the transaction for business purposes.
1426	If that situation occurs, ENA MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot solicit the party to enter into the transaction.
1426	If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or sell by the counterparty.
1426	Please call me if you have any questions.
1426	Thanks.
1426	Sara [ENA legal]
1427	John: Please call me when you have had a chance to review.
1427	Sara
1428	Susan: have you heard anything?
1428	Also, before I forget, please document the account in London with CSFB that we used to receive money in connection with metals trading.
1429	All: Attached is a short recap of the items which I have been discussing with Clint and Jeff.
1429	I'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow.
1429	Rex and Jim: I will fax to you copies of the Enron Corp. resolutions (some final, some draft only) referenced in the attached summary.
1429	I may not have the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet.
1429	Please call me with a suggested time.
1429	This afternoon is best for me.
1430	Trena: In the next week or so, I will be devoting most of my time and attention to Gary's world.
1430	I met with Gary last week, and he suggested that I give you a call to see if you needed any legal assistance.
1430	I am available for whatever you might need me for.
1430	My number in Houston is 713/853-5620.
1430	I'm looking forward to working with you.
1430	Regards.
1430	Sara
1431	please print - and - can you remind me what I need to do in order to print spreadsheets?
1431	thanks
1432	Tana: I hope I'm not repeating myself here but Laurel Adams (confirm desk - Hickerson) and Sheila Glover (Hickerson CFO) need access.
1432	If it's been provided already, my apologies for asking again.
1432	Thanks.
1432	Sara
1433	At last!
1433	Thursday morning at 10:30 am, Rex Rogers and Jim Armogida will meet with me in my office.
1433	You are invited.
1433	I suspect that much of our conversation will be a repeat of the meeting that you had last week.
1433	Sara
1434	Rod and I discussed this party (which always appears on the legal/credit list!!!! It seem that BP signed a Master Agreement (our OLD form) with ECTRIC on 1/8/98 and agreed to sign THE IDENTICAL AGREEMENT with ENA. Absent an executed agreement, ENA and BP continue to use a form of "Swap Contract" which had been agreed to many years ago (similar to our GTC's in the omnibus) which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement. Rod doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a high priority. Having said all of this, the form is limited to swaps, doesn't provide for setoff, arbitration, certain market disruption events and several other items which we can review if necessary. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. Thanks. Sara
1435	Please advise.
1435	Sara
1436	Here's the email!
1436	And thanks for your help this morning.
1436	Sara
1437	Carson: I have been pretty awful, haven't I?
1437	I took a short vacation to Dallas last Friday but I'm back now.
1437	I'd love to have lunch one day.
1437	Just give me a call (713/853-5620) and we can catch up.
1437	Not much news; same old, same old.
1437	Sara
1438	We are currently in negotiations with them.
1438	Please do not forward my emails to Bank One.
1438	Sara
1439	Paul R. and I will be waiting for your phone call on Monday, July 10 at 1 pm (Houston time).
1439	Sara
1440	Mary: Attached is a format that I used in 1999 to inquire about certain issues impacting financial trading with foreign counterparties.
1440	I also have information about possible New Guinea counsel which I will clear with Derrick and Haedicke.
1440	Our potential trading counterparty is a mining company called "OK Tedi".
1440	Sara
1441	please print
1442	FYI - looks like more waiting
1443	Just let me know -
1444	Tana: You offered to send the TXU agreement for multiple confirms.
1444	Thanks.
1444	Sara
1445	James: I just thought I'd follow up with you regarding our conversation of June 7, 2000.
1445	I thought that you were going to produce a new draft based upon our discussion.
1445	Please let me know if I misunderstood or if in fact the ball is in my court.
1445	Thanks.
1445	Sara
1446	James: Please ignore my earlier email.
1446	I do have your email of 6/13/00 and will respond as quickly as possible.
1446	Thanks.
1446	Sara
1447	Susan: Which Paribas are you referring to?
1448	All: It appears that this is the group which can best address the (derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.
1448	We have all undertaken to provide the group with the following items: (1) "Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity Derivatives" Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.
1448	Comments are invited.
1448	(2) The transacting party: ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron Corp.?
1448	Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate trading in ENA.
1448	I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.
1448	(3) Enron Corp. equity trading resolution Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.
1448	This will be necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will want to review (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires authorization.
1448	(4) Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.
1448	This can be used as our "form" for future transactions.
1448	(5) Enron Corp. "position paper" addressing equity derivative parameters, preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc. I have no volunteers.
1448	Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.
1448	As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.
1448	Please let me know if we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.
1448	Thanks for your help.
1448	Sara
1449	Bill: I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.
1449	I would like to revisit once again.
1449	These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE stock.
1449	There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools more frequently than in the past.
1449	I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely involved.
1449	Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.
1449	At a minimun, even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on behalf of Enron Corp.).
1449	I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.
1450	Where does this stand?
1450	Have you received the guaranty from Clem?
1451	All: I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, he is entirely neutral.
1451	However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron Corp. to transact on its own stock.
1451	I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining potential targets in the name of "Enron Corp."
1451	without Credit Support Annexes.
1451	Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).
1451	The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp. These are "Deemed ISDA's" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the parties do represent that they have such authority).
1451	Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp. Thanks.
1451	Sara
1452	Has Mark spoken with you yet about Latin America?
1452	Let's talk!
1452	Sara
1453	Susan: Please forward your two emails (re: HS Resources,et al) to Bill Bradford and John Suttle.
1453	SS
1454	Joel: Are you also going to send out the ABN Amro guaranty?
1454	We're sending the draft credit agreement.
1454	Sara
1455	Joel: thanks - everything was sent out as draft as we don't have all internal comments (and we don't even know ABN's position!).
1455	Sara
1456	FYI
1457	per my voice mail
1458	Brent: you should be taking this over.
1458	Sara
1459	John: Jason is out of the office until Wednesday.
1459	Sara
1460	Paul: Here's the report which I will resurrect.
1460	I'll have you review the revision before we send out.
1460	SS
1461	Jarrod: attached is my prior redline with suggested comments.
1461	You'll see that I need to verify some dates, and I will call.
1461	Ultimately, we will send new drafts to Joe and each of John Byrnes (jbyrnes@dlalaw.com) and Steve Zacharias (szacharias@media-general.com).
1461	Joe should verify numbers.
1462	Kaye: Can this be printed on legal?
1463	My fax number is (713) 646-3490.
1463	Thanks.
1463	Sara
1464	FYI
1465	did I already send this to you?
1465	sara
1466	Dear Dan: Sorry not to send the check last week as promised.
1466	It seems that my mom landed in a hospital in England and I had to dash out of town.
1466	Now, eight days later, I am just catching up.
1466	Tomorrow (July 19) I will send the check to you by Federal Express for Friday delivery together with my request for a response from you to the "birthday boy".
1466	I did receive your newsletter - thanks very much.
1466	Regards.
1466	Sara
1467	Trena: We have ISDA agreements as follows: (1) CIBC (a) Enron Corp. has a 1/17/96 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act through offices in Tokyo, London and New York.
1467	If this agreement is used, we need to add FX/currency provisions.
1467	(b) ENA has a 10/1/94 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act through offices in Toronto, Tokyo and London.
1467	The agreement was amended on 5/24/96 (to add a collateral annex), on 7/27/97 t(o add FX/currency option and FRABBA provisions) and on 1/13/00 (to amend thresholds).
1467	(2) Deutsche Bank AG ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.
1467	We are speaking with Stephen Kessler (legal) in New York.
1467	ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.
1467	We sent a draft ISDA to Terence Zahner in New York on 10/6/99.
1467	This was suppose to be forwarded to lawyers in Germany.
1467	We left a message for someone named Roger Ackerman in NY in March, 2000.
1467	Please let me know if you need anything further.
1467	Sara
1468	I think this is the internet trading ag (CSFB).
1468	Please prepare a file and let me know if this is the std form.
1468	SS
1469	Samantha: this is your file, inherited from Susan Flynn.
1469	SS
1470	FYI
1471	FYI
1472	Looking ahead to our meeting on Tuesday, there are three Canadian Top Tens without any credit activity.
1472	Can we delete these?
1472	Legal cannot move forward without credit's response.
1472	Thanks.
1472	Sara
1473	Darren: Is Prime Trade for ENA or ECT Investments?
1473	Sheila: Would you please send an email to Ted?
1474	Brent: this is weather!
1474	Please call Scott.
1474	SS
1475	Jason: did you call Per?
1475	If not, please bring him up to date.
1475	Thanks.
1475	SS
1476	Tana: look in lotus notes.
1476	I think you should contact Russell for Canada (since Rod is gone).
1476	Cyntia Pastega is the business person.
1476	SS
1477	I just wanted to make sure this was handled.
1477	Also, we have capacity in Lotus Notes for confirm comments.
1478	All: I am comparing this list to mine but Jill's certainly looks more comprehensive!
1478	Jill said she may not have signed confirms, etc. but we should get copies of all live equity deals.
1478	I don't have paralegal capability for this work at the moment.
1478	Sara Julia: Could you please call me when you receive this message?
1479	Paul: Could you please let me know?
1479	Sara
1480	FYI
1481	I'll try to call you later (or vice-versa) about the memo.
1481	Also, if you are willing, we'd love your participation in the credit/legal meeting.
1481	SS
1482	FYI
1483	FYI
1484	Brent, FYI: I am taking my name off of this list.
1484	I am not up to date on any activity in South America.
1484	However, to the extent that you are unable to travel, I am glad to back you up.
1484	Do we need to talk about South America as I sign off?
1484	Sara
1485	David: I am inquiring to see if you would be available for a short conference call tomorrow with a few credit related items.
1485	I cannot recall the exact time difference between Houston and Geneva, but I can contact you at 9 am Houston time (or later as you wish).
1485	I have your phone number as 4122 3221111.
1485	Please advise.
1485	Regards.
1485	Sara
1486	What's the best time to call you to discuss your memo?
1486	Also, unless I hear from you otherwise, I will plan on conferencing you into our legal/credit meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm.
1486	I have your number as (281) 890-7122.
1487	Here's the name of our contact for Lotus Notes.
1487	SS
1488	All: Here's another new transaction for me!
1488	I'm gathering the info promised last week.
1488	Sara
1489	Tana: Would you please handle?
1489	Thanks.
1489	Sara
1490	ask paralegals, the answer is yes, and there is also a special EOL format (I believe)
1491	Julia: don't do anything yet as I am putting together the package for this afternoon.
1491	Sara
1492	Are you aware of this?
1492	I don't know the relationship between these two banks and whether our 7/1/95 ISDA will be transferred to the UK bank.
1492	Let me know if you have any information.
1492	Thanks.
1492	Sara
1493	Samantha: You're doing a great job with Lotus Notes!!
1493	I'm impressed.
1493	Just a few thoughts about some agreements which have fallen through the cracks (on record keeping): (1) ABN AMRO in Australia (futures) - Jason is working on this (2) Bank One (give-up agreement) - Mary is now working on this
1494	Please speak with Tana.
1494	She will provide you with the full explanation
1495	Susan: As a result of our last meeting, please contact the counterparties on the following agreements for status update: (1) Reliant Energy Services, Inc./ENA (don't worry about Reliant Energy Services Canada Ltd. for now; we'll dupe) (2) Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (3) MP Energy Partnership (4) Stone Container Corporation
1496	Carol and Rod: I need to follow up on both Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank.
1496	Rod: Could you please call me tomorrow?
1496	Carol: I'll take a look at the files and send you an email.
1496	Thanks.
1496	Sara
1497	Dale: Per my voice mail.
1497	Sara
1498	(1) I just received my copy of the Annex to the 2000 ISDA Definitions.
1498	Have we previously distributed the "2000 ISDA Definitions" (consolidation of the 1991, 1998 Supp. and certain other 1998 Euro Definitions)?
1498	(2) I have the blue file for Swiss Bank/ENE.
1498	We need to change the label in conformity with our procedures for mergers.
1498	Taffy, can you handle, please?
1499	Hi, Edmund!
1499	Please identify the ENTIRE Morgan name, please.
1499	We are negotiating with several of their entities.
1499	Which type of trading?
1499	Thanks.
1499	Sara
1500	Mary: Would you please send me a copy of the metals confirm and the final format to which ENA agreed?
1500	Thanks.
1500	Sara
1501	Mary: We deleted this counterparty from the legal/credit list yesterday.
1501	Since commercial is not pushing, we determined that it would be imprudent to hire outside counsel at this time.
1501	Sara
1502	Per my earlier email and the one below, could you please let us know about the 2000 Defintions?
1502	Thanks.
1502	Sara
1503	FYI
1504	Carol: Peter del Vecchio is looking for Canadian counsel in connection with a paper acquisition and inquired about Stikeman.
1504	Have you worked with any of their lawyers (perhaps on the Canadian cash collateralization issue)?
1505	Can you please print the attached and next message with the correct margins and then label a manila file as "Accounting: Issue Nos 96-13, 00-19 and
1506	Would you please generate a fresh ENE guaranty and email to the lawyer (see Lotus Notes - Emma Nakakuki is the new attorney).
1506	Also, please verify with credit (Rod Nelson in London) that the guaranty cap has not changed.
1506	I have the file in my office.
1506	Thanks.
1506	SS
1507	Please print the email and attachment (click "view").
1507	I need to learn how to handle margins when printing.
1507	Thanks.
1507	Sara
1508	Please enter into Lotus Notes so that we can track.
1509	Peter: check with Shari Stack.
1509	Sara
1510	Let's talk.
1510	Sara
1511	I received a call again from Gary Ordway.
1511	Who will be preparing credit?
1511	Gary asked that his credit person be copied and his name is John Fryer.
1511	Thanks.
1511	Sara
1512	Bob: I am having a stack of materials relating to Enron Corp. equity trading sent to your attention via Federal Express on Monday.
1512	DO NOT READ ANYTHING YOU RECEIVE.
1512	Rex, Jim and I have been discussing the variety of Enron Corp. equity derivatives on ENE stock, the latest accounting issuances, ENE Board resolutions, confirmation templates and the like.
1512	Rex should be contacting you shortly to schedule a conference call.
1512	The package of materials MIGHT be useful when we discuss the foregoing issues (or, it might be totally useless!).
1512	Hope you have a great weekend.
1512	Regards.
1512	Sara
1513	Have you had a chance to review Dale's product description?
1513	Please let's discuss.
1513	Sara
1514	Ben Bedell, the lawyer for BT, has called to about the calculations I forwarded to you on Wednesday.
1514	Are we agreed?
1514	Please let me know asap.
1514	I know that the parties wanted to close today.
1514	Sara
1515	Hi, Clem!
1515	Please see below message from Sheila Glover.
1515	I believe that in the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.
1515	I'll be speaking with Paul Radous in credit.
1515	Do you see any issues here?
1515	Sara
1516	Is the question for online and offline products (to the extent that we gear up for metals online)?
1517	Tana: per my voice mail re: EOL.
1518	The ETA provides that a master agreement will control (over GTC's) if a master agreement has been executed by the parties.
1518	Sara
1519	Elizabeth: You can remove my name (and Kaye Ellis's name) from the list.
1519	Brent Hendry will handle Latin America financial trading for now.
1519	Thanks.
1519	Sara
1520	Mary: Just a reminder.
1520	Tana is not in charge of form changes; Susan Bailey handles that function.
1520	Tana's primary role is "special projects" but she is helping Susan and Samantha with daily matters until Stephanie begins work and has some experience.
1520	Sara
1521	Attached is the latest listing.
1521	Please send comments and corrections.
1522	Laurel: I need to verify the Enron party (specifically).
1522	I am reviewing the format.
1522	Thanks.
1522	Sara
1523	Rod: FYI, Paul's doing bond swap with UBS.
1523	Does credit have any issues?
1523	I am verifying the Enron party (since I am not familiar with the ECT Investment Trust).
1523	Please advise.
1523	Sara
1524	Bob: Did you ever speak with Justin Boyd in our London office (as suggested by Paul Simons) about the MG traders or what Justin can tell us about the acquisition?
1524	Sara
1525	Pizzolato (a director in the debt portfolio group)
1526	Edmund: could you please identify the Morgan entity you are referencing?
1526	Sara
1527	I don't know anything about this.
1527	Sara
1528	Paul: Jason sent the following issues to me but Nos. 1,2 and 4 impact credit.
1528	Please call me to discuss.
1528	Sara
1529	Hi, Jason!
1529	Please send me your phone and fax.
1529	Do you still have voice mail over here?
1529	Regarding your message, I have asked Paul to consider items 1,2 and 4 since each bears upon credit.
1529	I'll get back to you.
1529	On a different note, how would you like some more work?
1529	Call when you're free.
1529	Sara
1530	Ted: I never received the updated list mentioned in our Monday meeting.
1530	Could you please email one to me?
1530	Thanks.
1530	Sara
1531	Mark: Russell Diamond in credit said that you took a call from the WPS lawyer about 10 days ago.
1531	You entered the call into Lotus Notes.
1531	(1) What was the conversation about?
1531	(2) Did you assign this file to anyone?
1531	Thanks.
1531	Sara
1532	Carol: Hope all is well.
1532	We are missing you every day.
1532	(1) On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ENA.
1532	Can you recall where we left off on the issue?
1532	I seem to remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held in a U.S. account).
1532	(2) On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception Report (originally sent to your attention).
1532	What were you doing to follow up on this report?
1532	Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter" being sent by Molly Harris.
1532	Did you speak with Mary about working on this project in your absence?
1532	Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.
1532	Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.
1532	That's all the news for now.
1532	Talk to you soon.
1532	Sara P.S.
1532	Can you send photos over the net?
1533	Clint: after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will be drafted for the Oct. meeting.
1533	In the interim, he is convinced that only Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc. I am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our approach.
1533	This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear (from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board meeting. Sara
1534	Mary: Please let me know what happens.
1534	All calculations should be made as of a specific date.
1534	Sara
1535	Cathy and I left a message for Per since he originates hedge funds.
1535	SS
1536	Ken: In connection with our new product (and absence of any physical activity in that product), I have the following question: If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?
1536	I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.
1536	I am available to speak at your convenience.
1536	Thanks.
1536	Sara [713/853-5620]
1537	Attached are sample templates for ISDA confirms which you requested.
1537	The swap (first template) includes sample NG Floating Price language.
1537	Sara
1538	I will need to be at my home today and tomorrow at 4 pm for repair estimates.
1538	I will coordinate my schedule with Kaye.
1538	Sara
1539	Mark: Do we have any special considerations/expertise with respect to the evaluation of "internet trading platform" agreements?
1539	I am starting to see more of these from Gary's group.
1539	Please let me know.
1539	Currently, I have Jason evaluating two of these.
1539	Sara
1540	Mary: I hear through the grapevine that we may be trading through Bank One.
1540	In any event, we need to add all of the executed agreements to the Lotus Notes database.
1540	Samantha should be able to handle this for you since she maintains and updates the brokerage reports and keeps the files near her desk.
1540	Thanks.
1540	Sara
1541	Edmund: Did you draft the DTD language?
1541	I have questions.
1541	Also, I wouldkindly appreciate your response on Morgan Stanley.
1541	Thanks.
1541	Sara
1542	The attached confirm is a swap.
1542	There is no need for a rep in the confirm.
1542	If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade Option rep into the confirmation.
1542	The desk uses a template for options.
1542	Let me know if you have any other questions.
1542	Sara
1543	I don't have a 7/28/00 email from you.
1543	What do you need?
1543	SS
1544	Yes, please.
1544	Sara
1545	Who will be handling P&G this 'go-round?
1545	Sara
1546	Susan: I need to see if we ever incorporated any P&G comments into any prior draft.
1546	Then we should redraft a new master (but let's speak with Ed first).
1546	Thanks.
1546	Sara
1547	Edmund: Attached is a slightly different version of DTD Brent which I havedrafted.
1547	I would like to discuss.
1547	Please let me know when you can talk.
1547	Sara
1548	You bet!
1548	It's me.
1548	I've been at Enron since mid-1994.
1548	Sara
1549	The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South Africa regarding FX clearances.
1549	It seems that prior to transacting with a South African party, we need copies of the party's "certification" from the National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby converting local currency to USD).
1549	Such approvals are severely restricted.
1549	I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our "database" of global advice.
1549	Sara
1550	Sheila: I just received the package from Simmons.
1550	Will you please send your request to the usual suspects?
1550	Thanks.
1550	Sam: Will you please track this agreement on Lotus Notes?
1550	Thanks.
1551	Yes.
1551	Sara P.S.
1551	Can you call me and let me know what products you are looking to trade online.
1552	Kevin: Attached is a draft form of confirm.
1552	There are many details to be completed but this is a start.
1552	Sara
1553	I hope this is really for you!
1553	Sara
1554	...and here's the rest...
1554	Could you please handle?
1555	John: Did you speak with John Nicholson?
1555	I need his phone number please.
1555	Call me.
1555	Sara
1556	Ken: Where can I find the CFTC's statement that the swap policy statement is not available for agricultural trade options?
1556	We are in a "holding pattern" for the time being.
1556	No products have been developed.
1556	Thanks.
1556	Sara
1557	ENA is waiting for a blackline from Harvard's outside lawyer which should incorporate all previous discussions.
1557	Until that time, we cannot be certain that Harvard has incorporated all of our comments and concessions.
1557	Sara Per: Do you want to have a conference call with all of us?
1558	Mary: Mieco is one of Carol's "Top Tens".
1558	Would you please take this one?
1558	Ed Sacks will be calling you shortly.
1558	Thanks.
1558	Sara
1559	Friday is best for me.
1559	I think you should have John S. available.
1559	I'll make sure that Jason is available by phone.
1559	SS
1560	Tina: Per my voice mail, please provide me with a copy of the confirm of the referenced transaction booked by J. Aron in the name of ENA rather than Enron Corp., expiring 12/08/00, settling 12/11/00 (collar, Strike 1.55).
1560	Who is monitoring?
1560	ENA (and Enron Corp.) are being asked to execute this novation.
1560	Thanks.
1560	Sara
1561	Libby Rutherford - legal Irene Yates - tax
1562	FYI - is Tina right?
1563	Brent: In connection with the "research memoranda" which I gave to you, the specific issue about whether ENA can hold cash collateral posted by a Canadian party has arisen in connection with a company named J.D. Irving, Limited.
1563	ENA legal has spoken with Peter Keohane, two Canadian law firms and one US law firm, and previously concluded that it was easier to simply not accept cash.
1563	Please see what you can do!
1563	Thanks.
1563	Sara
1564	I don't know this S&C lawyer!
1565	Brent and Ed: I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you both to each other (if you haven't already met!).
1565	Ed: Brent is handling Latin America.
1565	Brent: Ed is part of our pulp & paper commercial group.
1565	Can you please respond to his inquiry?
1565	Thanks.
1565	Sara
1566	Kaye: Will you please print this out for me?
1566	Thanks.
1566	Sara
1567	FYI as we sort through this structure.
1568	You're FAST!
1569	Done.
1569	Thanks.
1569	Sara
1570	Jason: Two more electronic agreements.
1570	Samantha: Please enter into database.
1571	Justin/Paul: The Houston contingent of EnronCredit.com Limited has a number of agreements which they would like to have executed.
1571	All ENA/Enron Corp. affiliate brokerage/futures agreements are signed by the Enron trading party TOGETHER WITH Ted Murphy (for control purposes).
1571	I am currently reviewing about 4-6 of these agreements.
1571	How should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from Houston?
1571	Shall I continue to review?
1571	Do you have trading resoutions/authorized trader lists in place for EnronCredit.com Limited?
1571	I look forward to hearing from you.
1571	Sara
1572	Sheila: Mike Fowler is involved in this effort.
1572	He tells me that the entity is "EnronCredit.com Limited".
1572	Is this info correct?
1572	Sara
1573	Mary: After our last credit meeting, Russell's idea of "following up" on this counterparty was to assign it to Ed Sacks!
1573	Can you please work with Ed?
1573	This is one of Carol's files.
1573	Once negotiated, it will serve as the basis for Reliant Energy Services Canada Ltd. Thanks.
1573	Sara
1574	please print on legal
1575	Kaye: Please remind me on Monday of this "delivery".
1575	Thanks.
1575	Hope you had a great weekend.
1575	Sara
1576	Mark: I am totally confused.
1576	WHO is addressing CFTC issues for MG London, Inc.?
1576	What is Alan's involvement?
1576	SS
1577	Good morning David!
1577	Just hoping that you could have the confirm sent this morning.
1577	I need to review with the commercial guys.
1577	Thanks.
1577	Sara
1578	Edmund: Did you ever have a chance to run my language by your trader?
1578	Sara
1579	Molly: I left you a voice mail this morning about Citibank.
1579	The file reflects that you received correspondence from Citibank on 2/22/00 and Carol St. Clair had propsed revisions to the existing 1/9/96 ISDA Master Agreement (including changes to the CSA).
1579	Have you agreed to those changes?
1579	The Australia office is inquiring about the status of this Master Agreement.
1579	Thanks.
1579	Sara
1580	I am not aware of the nuances of copper trading!
1580	However, I left a message earlier this morning to find out from the MG lawyer.
1580	I haven't heard back.
1580	The deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and, if not, I would use our standard language.
1580	Sara
1581	here it is
1582	Molly: I'll send to you the latest draft.
1582	Shane is looking to do a rate swap and that is fine without FX amendments!
1582	But, shouldn't we verify whether our business will include FX (or did you already confirm)?
1582	Thanks.
1582	Sara
1583	All: I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with respect to MG London, Inc. from a U.S. regulatory perspective and WHO is addressing them.
1583	My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.
1583	I will try to have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course of action, etc. I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can include them as necessary.
1583	Thanks.
1583	Sara
1584	David: I'm just reviewing your fax and although your recap of the floating rate calculation was correct on the phone, there is no language in the confirm.
1584	Were you going to respond to this as well?
1584	(interest rate to apply to reduced notional, etc.)
1585	All: (1) Please provide the name of the Enron party to this agreement.
1585	If it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.
1585	I never heard back from Paul Simons.
1585	(2) What is the priority?
1585	I think we are waiting to hear back from Mike because we have had a conversation with the BuySideDirect people and can give an additional explanation.
1585	Sara
1586	All: Attached are the following docs: (1) Talon I LLC/Harrier I LLC equity swap confirm (2) Harrier I LLC/EBS Investments, L.L.C.
1586	equity swap confirm (3) revised ISDA Master Agreement Schedule for Harrier I LLC and EBS Investments, L.L.C.
1586	Please review and provide me with your comments.
1586	I do not have all necessary address and account information.
1586	The swaps are subject to the ISDA 1996 Equity Derivatives Definitions.
1586	Section 7.4 (of those Definitions) contains the payment obligations and provides that the Equity Amount Payer pays a positive Equity Amount and "the other party" pays the absolute value of a negative Equity Amount.
1586	Also, I believe that Accounting Issue 00-19 is inapplicable to this Total Return Swap or else we may have issues with the "Extraordinary Events" elections.
1586	Sara
1587	Kaye: Please print out the 3 docs for me.
1587	Thanks.
1587	SS
1588	Brent is looking into this issue.
1589	what tab?
1590	Mark: I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing member, FCM, CTA).
1590	NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal perspective and I think it should be the swap group.
1590	Enron's "regulated" product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) choose to become a regulated "ATOM" (ag trade option merchant).
1590	From a legal perspective, I think we should have a "whitepaper" drafted by Sullivan & Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing situation.
1590	This would tie into the ag regulation.
1590	Also, have you thought about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, etc.) and any other related issues?
1590	For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has asked to join us.
1590	Donna and I had a conference call this morning with Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out who's on first (with MG).
1590	Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.
1590	I have reached the breaking point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com London).
1590	Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.
1590	See you later.
1590	Sara
1591	FYI
1592	The interest component was eliminated from the terms of this Transaction (as was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name change).
1592	It seems that Ben and Scott S. had a subsequent conversation (after ours) and the agreed changes were communicated to me.
1592	SS
1593	I need someone assigned to assist in amending this agreement.
1593	Most of the work is done.
1593	Please let me know ASAP.
1594	Jason: Before we designate specific individuals, let's think this through.
1594	A "generic" address may be more appropriate.
1594	Which agreement did we recently sign with reference to the "Documentation Desk"?
1594	Sara
1595	FYI
1596	Sam: Please get on my calendar for Friday.
1596	We need to update agreements, status, etc. Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus Notes.
1596	Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and provide a copy for me.
1596	Let's take about an hour.
1596	Thanks.
1596	Sara ps Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!
1597	pls print docs
1598	You already knew this was ok with me I hope.
1599	Shane: Here's the scoop (1) ENA has an existing ISDA Master Agreement with Citibank N.A..
1599	dated as of November 17, 1992.
1599	The Master is not restricted to any particular type of transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.
1599	ENA is the Calculation Agent.
1599	Also, only commodity transactions are netted.
1599	(2) Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.
1599	The amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities.
1599	It also states Citibank to be "multibranch" with NY and London offices acting under the Master.
1599	Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).
1599	Mollie Harris in credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.
1599	(3) ABN Amro is in my office ready for signature.
1599	I will have it executed and email you when done.
1599	Samantha Boyd (Ext.39188) will help me with the followup.
1599	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1600	Kaye: Please schedule Sam for an hour on Friday.
1600	Also, when avoidable, I'd prefer not to meet at 1 pm because people are always late.
1600	Thanks.
1600	sara
1601	All: I have once again revised the confirm for the EBS Raptor deal.
1601	There will be only one swap transaction: Harrier I LLC/Talon I LLC.
1601	Please note the following changes: (1) the Initial Equity Notional Amount has been corrected (2) I have expanded the definition of Cash Dividends (3) I have ADDED a provison for "Payment Obligations" to avoid confusion for those of you unfamiliar with the 1996 Equity Definitions.
1601	Since I have removed the interest payment feature, the only payments changing hands will be upside/dividends and downside.
1601	The "Equity Amount Payer" pays the upside (difference between Initial Price (on the relevant Valuation Date) and Final Price) and dividends; the other party pays the downside.
1601	(4) I have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates.
1601	(5) Kevin: I NEED the Harrier account/notice information.
1601	This confirm should serve as a template for additional Raptor equity share swaps so please review and comment.
1601	Thanks.
1601	Sara
1602	Darren: Laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending brokerage/futures agreements.
1602	Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron company.
1602	ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.
1602	Sheila Glover always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance and Ted Murphy.
1602	Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an effort to avoid confusion.
1602	Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading resolutions.
1602	Let me know if you have any questions.
1602	Sara
1603	I am receiving calls from Gina Karathanos in Global Finance about this deal.
1603	She's inquiring about preparation of certificates, authorizations and signers.
1603	Susan, please coordinate with Mary on that end (I presume we follow the same format as Carol).
1603	As far as I know, closing is scheduled for Aug. 24.
1603	Apparently, lots of ENE officers will be out of town next week.
1603	Do we know who will sign for ENA?
1603	Thanks.
1603	SS
1604	Will focus later today.
1604	How are we handling ABN Amro?
1604	I want to have executed.
1604	Were you going to revise the notice page and add the location on the trading floor in the other agreement (?).
1604	Please talk to Sam.
1604	The docs are in my office.
1604	I have meetings all afternoon.
1604	Thanks.
1604	Sara
1605	Kaye: re: my vm about John Stoner in California, BEWARE as I may have this meeting (which is more important)!!!!!!!!!!!
1605	Maybe Stoner can be at the end of the day here.
1606	Is John also responsible for brokerage/futures?
1606	Will he run through Ted?
1606	Will we keep copies?
1607	Sami: Congratulations!!!!!!!!
1607	She's adorable.
1607	Sara
1608	Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments: (1) I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap.
1608	Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).
1608	I met with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price return only: the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.
1608	PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN (2) With respect to the right of "multiple optional partial swap terminations", please verify that: (a) the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells the underlying shares.
1608	How is this right of termination (and the multiple requests) to be documented?
1608	(b) the "Initial Price" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price on the date of each partial termination)
1609	Mark: (1) Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?
1609	(2) Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?
1609	Shouldn't default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp.
1609	secretary?
1609	And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?
1609	There is no electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.
1609	I am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.
1609	Thanks.
1609	Sara
1610	Tana: Have you responded to either Greg or Molly?
1610	Please call.
1610	Sara
1611	Mark: Do you want to speak with the Bank of Montreal about an ISDA with Japan?
1611	Darren has been sending calls to me re: ISDA's and brokerage agreements for our Japanese affiliate.
1611	Sara
1612	Re: Bank of Montreal and ENA, have we terminated the CES agreement (and has credit agreed)?
1612	I don't know how Susan F. "inactivated" the CES ISDA with BOM, We are in the process of negotiating with BOM in connection with our Japanese affiliate.
1612	Sara
1613	How are we handling the "dual agreement" situation?
1613	Have we spoken with credit?
1614	I returned your call about 10 minutes ago.
1614	Sara
1615	Mike: We have sent our comments.
1615	We do not need anything from you yet.
1615	Thanks.
1615	Sara
1616	Tana: I don't know who Brad Diebner is.
1616	However, Greg called me.
1616	What Greg really needs is the ENA "form" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election).
1616	He will also need a "generic" Paragraph 13.
1616	The boilerplate can be mailed.
1616	Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later today.
1616	Thanks.
1616	Sara
1617	Jason: I left a vm for Clement.
1617	Keep your fingers crossed.
1617	SS
1618	Here they are.
1619	All: Please review for content.
1619	This deal has been recast as a "Price Return Swap" and I hope it is self-explanatory (i.e., you won't have to drag out the 1996 Equity Definitions).
1619	I will forward a draft letter shortly.
1620	FYI
1621	The swap group has a meeting every other Tuesday, including Aug. 22.
1621	Either Mary or I will try to attend.
1622	All: During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX business to MLIB Ltd. ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.
1622	ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.
1622	Will someone in credit approve this transfer?
1622	Please let Stephanie Panus (X53249), our newest paralegal, know.
1622	Thanks.
1622	Sara
1623	for "Cash Settlement Amount": If for any Determination Period, the Floating Price is less than or equal to the Strike Price, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Notional Quantity per Determination Period multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Strike Price over the Floating Price, which amount shall be due and payable by the Seller on the applicable Payment Date for such Determination Period.
1623	P.S.
1623	Melissa: In the future, send me the deal ticket for review.
1624	I just received this from Stoner.
1624	Tanya: I haven't reviewed this agreement, but my guess is that it may change some of the additional definitions contained in our March draft.
1624	Sara
1625	Please remember that MELISSA MURPHY (X31886) handles ALL financial power confirmations.
1625	Any financial power confirm questions should be directed to Melissa.
1625	Joe Hunter's group does NOT prepare financial power confirms except in extrememly limited cases (i.e., NYMEX based trades).
1625	If you have any questions, please call.
1625	Thanks.
1625	Sara
1626	Brent: Just a reminder, we track all trading agreements in our Lotus Notes database (you can enter negotiating issues, etc.).
1626	Samantha oversees this part of the database, updates Ted Murphy and has the agreements executed and filed.
1626	All trading agreements are signed by Ted and the business unit VP.
1626	Please keep Samanthat in the loop.
1626	Thanks.
1626	Sara
1627	Why don't we talk about this.
1627	I have initiated Samantha as the trading agreement guru.
1627	That's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these agreements (amendments included).
1627	Let's distinguish margin lines from trading agreements (although the margin line concept obviously includes a futures or other arrangement) I maintain a list ("in the pipeline") which I circulate to the Hickerson desk since that desk opens the greatest number of trading agreements.
1627	Sara
1628	I'm glad you're checking up.
1628	The copy of the confirm that I have HAS NO COMMENTS.
1628	I have no name either.
1628	What are the issues?
1628	Sara
1629	Susan: Would you please send a copy of the referenced agreement to Ellen Su (30th floor - Gary's group).
1629	Thanks.
1629	Sara
1630	Carson: What a miserable "friend" I am!
1630	I would love to meet you and Donna anytime at all.
1630	Please let me know.
1630	I have been running around like crazy.
1630	We are understaffed and I work too hard.
1630	Also, I had to take a week off in mid-July to rescue my mom who ended up in a hospital in Salisbury, England while attempting to attend the funeral of a cousin.
1630	Mother is fine.
1630	I (on the other hand) do not take a vacation until October and I hope to live.
1630	Maybe you and Donna want to come over one night and raid my wine cellar.
1630	That would be fun for a change.
1630	We could pick up food from Eatzi's or wherever.
1630	Can't wait to hear from you.
1630	Sara
1631	Please call - X35620
1632	Latest draft.
1633	The business guys are: Kevin Cordesman and Andrew Conner If you email John Stoner, please cc these guys (and me).
1633	Thanks.
1634	Kay: I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding Midwest.
1634	Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).
1634	Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..
1634	Thanks.
1634	Sara Greg: I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately.
1635	Stephanie: Please send the boilerplate ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex to Gregg Penman in our Chicago office.
1635	Thanks.
1635	Sara
1636	All: Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties: Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited CSFB International Lehman Brother Finance S.A. Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Deutsche Bank These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.
1636	The Treasury group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.
1636	Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?
1636	Thanks.
1636	Sara
1637	Call me when you have a chance
1638	Is Mark sending you these or are you on a direct mail?
1639	Kristina: As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a new level.
1639	I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor deals.
1639	As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of termination is a potential issue.
1639	Sara
1640	FYI - and I'm next door to Dan Lyons.
1641	Melissa: Would you please sent David an example of a confirm with the GTC's (standard Annex A).
1641	Please cc me.
1641	Thanks.
1641	Sara
1642	Do you know who Jane Wilhite is?
1643	Hey, Jen: I'm not going to email you to death like some people but I hear through the grapevine that you're having a blast and making tons of friends.
1643	I told your mom that she and I should rent a convertible, don our sunglasses and drive to Natchitoches to go shopping at the Walmart and take you to lunch.
1643	She didn't think you would like the idea too much.
1643	Hope you really are having a wonderful year, making lots of friends and stretching your brain power.
1643	Love, Sas P.S.
1643	How did you make out in your investment class?
1644	Da link!
1645	Please see MAP comments at the end.
1645	My phone number is 713/853-5620.

1645	Sara
1646	Please provide and notice and account information for the discussed confirmation to both Joe Hunter and Souad Mahmassani.
1646	It will be inserted into the confirm No. NQ9331.1,.2.
1646	Thanks.
1646	Sara
1647	Attached is my response.
1647	Sara
1648	John: I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's FX/rate/equity counterparties.
1648	My understanding from Gary is that EGM (through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, subject to tax and any regulatory input.
1648	I don't know if this has necessitated an agency arrangement between Japan and Houston (or another office, similar to London or Australia).
1648	Also, for netting reasons, Japan would not duplicate existing counterparty ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to ENA's agreement).
1648	Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.
1648	I look forward to hearing from you.
1648	Sara
1649	Robert: The executed "Representative Agreement" was executed by both ENA and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July 6, 2000.
1649	Let me know if you need anything further.
1649	Sara
1650	can you handle?
1651	Mark: I would like to request a flat panel monitor to replace my current monitor.
1651	Thank you.
1651	Sara
1652	Darren: I should have sent this message to you!
1652	Sara
1653	Tomorrow!
1653	Carson is gonna call you and coordinate.
1653	Sara
1654	Peter: I know that Gary Rosenblum is out of town until after Labor Day.
1654	Gary's voice mail directs callers to a gentleman with the last name of "McFarber" at Ext.
1654	6128..
1654	I left a voice mail for him this morning and have not heard back.
1654	Is there a lawyer to whom I can direct questions about your form of equity forward?
1654	Thanks very much.
1654	Sara (713/853-5620)
1655	Stephanie: I sent you a request last week for Gregg.
1655	Could you please send Gregg the boilerplate?
1655	Thanks.
1655	Sara
1656	Alan: You're reading my mind.
1656	I'll ask Kaye to schedulet some time this week.
1656	Thanks.
1656	Sara
1657	Mary: This is a paper and pulp master with some "different" provisions.
1657	I asked Susan to let you handle.
1657	The business person is Chris Croom (X31899).
1657	There is no "formal" credit worksheet but Tanya verified that the CP is an ESP.
1657	Sara
1658	I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.
1658	The trades originating in Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.
1658	I can't be certain if these are backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.
1658	In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.
1658	We have no master with this party.
1658	Who in Houston credit is looking at credit derivatives?
1658	FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.
1659	All: I would like to take Friday, Sept. 29 as a vacation day.
1659	Please advise if there are any conflicts.
1659	Thanks.
1659	Sara
1660	I haven't read all of the emails, but, Mark was going to handle Hawaii.
1660	SS
1661	My fax is 646-3490
1662	Bill: Thanks for the info.
1662	I also spoke with Jeff about how EnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) is responsible for that group.
1662	Maybe you will be able to clarify which of Jeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.
1662	Maybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.
1662	I'd appreciate an update.
1662	Sara
1663	Lucy: Check with Kaye Ellis (X35968) and get on my calendar.
1663	Sara
1664	please print
1665	please print item 14 only
1666	All: Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.
1666	On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.
1666	We have sent comments to the first two.
1666	Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low priority).
1666	ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not heard back.
1666	We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc. Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited..
1666	If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!) Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).
1666	Also, you should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.
1666	My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.
1666	Please let me know your comments or questions.
1666	Thanks.
1666	Sara
1667	please print all docs; I need a redwell.
1667	Thanks as usual.
1667	Sara
1668	and I need to print these also
1669	please "fix" my calendar.
1669	Thanks.
1669	ss
1670	Please call me.
1670	I'm not trying to derail the process.
1670	I have been waiting to understand the LLC intent and toward that end was advised that Kaye Mann was the lawyer to speak with.
1670	Kaye has not returned email or voice mail and I have once again requested her response.
1670	Willl you be handling credit for this LLC?
1670	Is it in competition with ENA?
1670	Sara
1671	Bill: The treasury group has two deals outstanding: Bear, Stearns International Limited and CSFB International.
1671	The Bear confirm has credit.
1671	The CSFB confirm has NO credit, not even for CSFB.
1671	Does this work for credit?
1671	Please advise.
1671	Sara
1672	I'm free after 11 am - Sara
1673	Please print
1674	attached is the template
1675	Subject to any deal changes, please review the attached format and comment.
1675	Before further distribution, I wanted to make certain that we were in agreement.
1675	SS
1676	Bill: Thanks for your message.
1676	Here's the information you requested: (1) Merrill Lynch: 1 year deal effective 8/4/00; 1,388,110 shares at $79.125 initial price (2) CSFB International: 1 year deal effective 5/11/00; 1,761,200 shares at $76.125 initial price Jeff Nogid is familiar with these transactions.
1676	Sara
1677	Attached are drafts of the foregoing items in connection with the equity swap.
1677	We will revise the swap again in the morning.
1677	Thanks.
1677	Sara
1678	Attached are the latest drafts.
1678	There have been some changes to the swap and a new blackline will be circulated in the a.m. These docs relate to the EBS deal.
1678	Sara
1679	Michael: Now that all of the immediate congratulatory calls and messages have worn down, let me (belatedly?) congratulate you on your wonderful promotion!
1679	I know you'll to an outstanding job.
1679	I look forward to visiting with you soon.
1679	Sara
1680	Mark: Congratulations!
1680	I was delighted to hear of your promotion.
1680	I look forward to visiting if I ever make it over to London.
1680	Sara
1681	Just let Mr. De Dalmas know that I asked someone to respond.
1681	SS
1682	The ISDA Master does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters.
1682	The issue which we discussed is authority.
1682	The Merced resolution of March 16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager "...to develop and provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading (ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs. Such executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to form."
1682	There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions (by Merced's traders).
1682	Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.
1682	Since Merced is a governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced authorized transactions.
1682	Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying resolution.
1682	Sara
1683	Russell: Thanks for the info.
1683	I do need to send a REMINDER to the credit group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, etc.) entering into financial trades.
1683	Where can I obtain the most recent list of credit people (you know how those credit people are) who deal with financial trading?
1683	Thanks.
1683	Sara P.S.
1683	the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.
1683	The other 10 % was considered "excess" for purposes of you know what.
1684	Laurel: Will John be trading in the names of BOTH ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. or only one of them?
1684	Is John located in London temporarily?
1684	Will Houston book the trades pursuant to the agency agreement?
1684	(I'm not certain which companies are covered by the agreement).
1684	Let's discuss.
1684	Thanks.
1684	Sara
1685	I'd like to the redraft.
1685	Sara
1686	Check out "www.psa.com" for publications/agreements (including repos) which you can download from The Bond Market Assoc.
1686	website.
1687	Should we send out a new draft without changing the guaranty language from the original draft?
1688	Sam: What happened to this agreement?
1688	It's not logged in on Lotus Notes aI need to review and have executed!
1688	Please call me.
1688	Thanks.
1688	Sara
1689	It's on my calendar!
1689	SS
1690	Sam: A couple of items from the meeting for you to follow up on: (1) Call the hedge funds to track execution (Ospraie, Tutor, Lawhill, etc.) (3) Call Small Ventures (4) Call Texla Energy Management (5) Where do we stand on FirstEnergy?
1690	Please be sure that the legal/credit meeting is on your calendar.
1690	Thanks.
1690	Sara
1691	Michael just delivered SITA's comments to me.
1691	I'll have a copy prepared for everyone.
1691	Tanya: I'll try to call you today (Michael wants to discuss now!?!?!?!?).
1691	Stephanie: I'm asking you to handle (this was one of Susan Flynn's deals).
1691	Thanks.
1691	Sara
1692	please print
1693	The Merced Board resolution is unclear.
1693	You should add a rep that the Merced Irrigation District has the authority to enter into the deal.
1693	Sara
1694	Melissa: Did you ever send this to David per my email?
1695	Bernardo is inquiring about this master.
1695	There is nothing current in Lotus Notes.

1705	The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with ENA.
1705	I think these should be booked directly with RMT.
1705	Please advise.
1705	Enron Netherlands Holding BV Enron Development Funding Ltd. EnronCredit.com Limited Thanks for your help.
1705	Sara
1706	MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.
1706	The companies have also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).
1706	I think RMT and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term plan for MG Ltd. Please confirm.
1706	Sara P.S.
1706	Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?
1707	Julia: Attached are the clean and redline versions, respectively.
1707	Please execute ASAP and send executed copy to Kristina.
1707	Thanks.
1707	Sara
1708	Attached are clean and redline versions of the latest markup.
1708	THIS REDRAFT IS BASED UPON COMMENTS RECEIVED TODAY FROM MARTHA PHILLIPS STUART WITH KIRKLAND & ELLIS.
1708	Ms. Stuart has received but has not reviewed the redraft.
1708	We expect to speak with her tomorrow.
1708	Julia Chin is the "point person" for contacting Ms. Stuart.
1708	Thanks.
1708	Sara
1709	DOES THIS INSTALL PRESENT ANY TAX ISSUES?
1709	HELP!
1709	Sara
1710	Here's Trading Edge (the comments are from an internal Enron group).
1710	This is a high priority.
1710	I'll review over the weekend and let's talk on Monday.
1710	Sara
1711	Steven: I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.
1711	I have a few questions prior to our comments.
1711	They are: (1) Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions which Carol sent to you?
1711	This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A. I did not see your response.
1711	(2) Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?
1711	I did not see your response.
1711	(3) What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.
1711	I know that DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?
1711	Have both parties agreed as to existing transactions?
1711	Please let me hear from you.
1711	Thanks.
1711	Sara
1712	John: I hear that you are trying to trade in the name of Enron North America Corp. while you sit in London.
1712	Althought both ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp. have agreements with Instinet Corporation, those companies are all U.S. companies without any presence in the U.K. (those companies do not pay U.K. taxes!) I have asked the ENA tax lawyers to review the implications of your proposed activity.
1712	I will try to speak with you Monday before things go too far.
1712	Please provide an immediate response and copy the tax lawyers noted above.
1712	Thanks.
1712	Sara
1713	Mark: I left you a voice mail last week about the comments from IT about the "Enron Corp. mandate" from Jim Derrick regarding negotiation of these agreements.
1713	Have you a solution?
1713	Sara
1714	do you want to handle?
1714	Sara
1715	Susan: Thanks for getting my paper over the weekend.
1715	I received more comments from the Credit Agricole Indosuez lawyers (outside).
1715	They are asking for the ENE guaranty.
1715	I have the file in my
1716	Sam: Could you please call these guys this morning and offer to fax the name change doc?
1716	Please let me know when this is done.
1716	This is a HIGH PRIORITY.
1716	Thanks.
1716	Sara
1717	Sheila: Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford should receive a request for this agreement.
1717	Sam: ECT Investments already has an agreement with Merrill Lynch.
1717	Let's take a look at it and review the format and our clearing brokers.
1717	Sara
1718	Here's your answer.
1718	We need to put an IMMEDIATE halt to the booking of EnronCredit.com Limited trades with ENA (as well as the others).
1718	Sara P.S.
1718	Lynn: Is there someone we need to notify with Enron Development or Enron Netherlands?
1719	Sharon: Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
1719	There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty identity itself.
1719	It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named "SITA", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.
1719	This does not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.
1719	Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.
1719	As you know, the agreement contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.
1719	Can you call me tomorrow?
1719	We need to address the major issues upfront.
1719	You can reach me at 713-853-5620.
1719	Thank you.
1719	Sara
1720	Are you still working every other day?
1720	Please see my SITA message to Sharon Lewis and let me know the most efficient way of proceeding.
1720	Thanks.
1720	Sara
1721	Laurel: Samantha is going to contact Merrill by phone and let them know of the preexisting ECT Investments agreement so that Merrill can duplicate for ENA.
1721	Sara
1722	Brent: Per my voice mail.
1722	I thought it made sense for you to review.
1722	Thanks.
1722	Sara
1723	Laurel: Will you please contact Treasury per Lynn's email below?
1723	Thanks.
1723	Sara
1724	yes, thanks.
1724	Sara
1725	Julia: I will review.
1725	Sara
1726	FYI
1727	FYI - also, as I mentioned, Janine should have her conclusions Tuesday.
1727	Sara
1728	Bill: I couldn't recall if I mentioned the above entity (35% Enron owned and 65% Burlington owned, I understand) but I was contacted by Ranabir Dutt (X35274) to review an ISDA and 10 year rate swap for Lost Creek and Barclays Bank PLC..
1728	I told Ranabir to contact credit.
1728	He said that was Enron was immediately selling its interest.
1728	The swap becomes effective 9/15/00.
1729	Hey, Mary!
1729	Can we meet early tomorrow morning?
1729	Sara
1730	Sam: We do need to enter into Lotus Notes.
1730	I am negotiating the futures agreement now together with PrimeTrade.
1730	Thanks.
1730	Sara
1731	Bill: I will fax to you the stair-step threshold in the DB Credit Support Annex.
1731	DB made a change and we cannot locate info in Carol St. Clair's file.
1731	Also, I am checking the guaranty and other changes marked by DB.
1731	Please note that I frequently see credit derivative deals between ECT Investments, Inc. and DB (unclear where EnronCredit.com Limited fits into thiis Houston picture!) where DB is requiring an ENE guaranty as well.
1731	Do we need an ISDA here?
1731	Thanks.
1731	Sara
1732	I have a copy AND Taffy should has a copy because she is preparing the notebooks with all of the defintions.
1733	What does this mean?
1734	Bill: Thanks.
1734	When will you have some time?
1734	Maybe tomorrow after our
1735	Sorry, but we're swamped.
1735	I will try to get to it this week.
1735	Please send me your phone number and fax.
1735	Thanks.
1735	Sara Please respond to Matthew.Flett
1736	Sam: Until Gary's group receives access to this part of our Lotus Notes database, we will have to rely on my "in the pipeline" list.
1736	The following agreements from that list need to be added to Lotus Notes: (3) Thomas Weisel Partners (5) LIMITrader Securities, Inc. (6) Trading Edge, Inc. My list identifies the Enron companies.
1736	Thanks.
1736	Sara
1737	Here is the list of Houston traders.
1737	Let me know if you need anything else.
1737	Sara
1738	Susan: Could you please answer Denis's request?
1738	He is a lawyer in the London office.
1738	Thanks.
1738	Sara
1739	no
1740	ECT Investments, Inc. ("ECTI") entered into a 5-YEAR credit derivative with Deutsche Bank ("DB") effective 7/19/00 with a Scheduled Termination Date of 7/19/05 (Loews Corporation is the reference credit).
1740	DB is requiring an Enron Corp. guaranty.
1740	There is no mention of guaranty terms.
1740	[NOTE THAT IN A SIMILAR DEAL 3/13/00 BASED UPON THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NO GUARANTY WAS REQUESTED].
1740	Should ECTI post the guaranty?
1740	Do we want a Master ISDA?
1740	Please let me know.
1740	Thanks.
1740	Sara
1741	This agreement needs to be added to Lotus Notes.
1741	It is required under the BuySideDirect agreement which is under simultaneous negotiation.
1741	Sara
1742	Hey, Carol!
1742	How is everyone and everything???
1742	I am always being asked about you, how's the baby, etc. I hope I haven't missed your visit to the office!
1742	I'm just working away (next to Dan Lyons, I might add) in my own little world.
1742	We are getting help soon and I don't know if Mark mentioned anything to you.
1742	Raptor is a "pain" and Mary has undergone trial by fire.
1742	I am counting the days until my vacation (to Marfa and Napa) which begins after the legal conference.
1742	Do you recall Project Marlin?
1742	I think Lance was involved.
1742	My memory is really bad if I worked on this deal.
1742	There's nothing in Lotus Notes (rats!).
1742	Take care (I'm starting to sound like David Mitchell).
1742	Sara
1743	Paul: Please email the confirm format.
1743	Thanks.
1743	Sara
1744	Mark: Your name was provided to me by John Greene who is temporarily residing in Enron's U.K. office.
1744	I am a lawyer in the Enron North America Corp. legal department.
1744	I need to speak with someone regarding the London Instinet installation.
1744	Two different Enron companies (both U.S. corporations) already have Instinet agreements.
1744	They are Enron North America Corp. and ECT Investments, Inc. The London installation would presumably be in the name of a DIFFERENT entity.
1744	I need to understand in WHAT NAME the installation will proceed.
1744	Please help to fill in the details ASAP.
1744	My number in Houston is 713-853-5620.
1744	I am this moment contacting David Terrace in London as I understand he handles all documentation.
1744	Thanks for your help.
1744	Sara
1745	as promised
1746	I will not be in the office tomorrow.
1746	Please contact me today if we need to discuss anything.
1746	Thanks.
1746	Sara
1747	Laurel: I am requesting an Enron Corp. guaranty (capped at US$20 million) for ECT Investments, Inc. I think we can sign the outstanding confirmation.
1747	Sara
1748	You were going to send me a copy of the Marlin confirm - Thanks.
1748	Sara
1749	Paul: I have several online trading agreements to be negotiated.
1749	Are you still reviewing credit issues?
1749	Sara
1750	Of course I did!
1750	Thanks.
1750	Sara
1751	I am on vacation during the week of Oct. 9.
1751	Sara
1752	Tax has confirmed that the MG deals should be confirmed in the name of RMT (and NOT ENA).
1752	I will have an RMT/MG Ltd. ISDA master put in place.
1752	Joe: (1) Please confirm the exact name of the MG entity.
1752	(2) Please confirm that the first trade date was [6/16/00].
1752	Susan: Please start the process for a new ISDA Master to be effective
1753	I was in the midst of sending this
1754	Gary: Thanks for the redraft.
1754	Would you please send the swap termination format for the Transaction so that I can review it together with the Transaction confirm?
1754	Thanks.
1754	Sara
1755	Tana: I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't forgotten to request the ENE guaranty on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc. in the amount of USD20 million.
1755	There is no Master yet but we are hopeful that this will be negotiated after the ENA Master.
1755	Thanks.
1755	Sara
1756	Tana: attached are the L/C provisions for the Deutsche Bank Master.
1756	Would you please verify that the provisions are in fact our language?
1756	Thanks.
1756	Sara
1757	Gary: The swap format is fine EXCEPT that the Floating Rate should be "6.62625%" rather than the rounded "6.63%".
1757	Thanks.
1757	Sara
1758	Jean: per our conversation, attached is a draft template.
1758	Thanks.
1758	Sara
1759	Why are you referring to "futures contracts" for the equities?
1759	I thought that the only futures were equity index contracts.
1760	Hi, Susan!
1760	I work with the FX/rate desk and Darren Delage is currently residing in Tokyo and trading.
1760	I have a conversation this evening with Alan Aronowitz, John Viverito and Darren to discuss Japan issues.
1760	At the moment, Darren has exeacuted several trades.
1760	These are being documented in Houston AS ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. trades.
1760	I had assumed that all trades would be done in the name of the Japanese financial trading entity; I have no idea who is handling back office functions.
1760	Can you update me?
1760	Thanks.
1760	Sara P.S.
1760	We MUST confirm all trades.
1761	Bob: Don't forget!
1761	I have several confirms with power counterparties that I need you to negotiate.
1761	Thanks.
1761	Sara
1762	Bill: I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements (for the purpose of entering into equity trades).
1762	In addition to the entities listed below, we need to include "Merrill Lynch International" ("MLI").
1762	ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. master should be fairly simple.
1762	Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.
1762	In that regard I note that Enron has an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York Branch.
1762	I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.
1762	Jeff/Clint: Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?
1762	All: I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either begin the ISDA process or change "ENA" to Enron Corp. on those agreements which have previously been sent.
1762	Thanks.
1762	Let me know if you have any questions.
1762	Sara
1763	Please print the original message and all of the attachments.
1763	Thanks.
1763	SS
1764	Jason: All I could find was a message from "Aaron" (in JUNE, 2000!) and the number was 212-409-0812.
1764	The only phone number that Sheila's group has is for Erin of Lou DeSimone, both of whom are printed on the fax cover sheet which I believe you have.
1764	Just keep a record of who you contact.
1764	Thanks.
1764	Sara
1765	Tana: Can Jason gain access to the database for the purpose of entering/reviewing comments?
1765	Sara
1766	Sheila: This party has rejected absolutely all of our comments.
1766	We were only told of this the other day when we called to inquire.
1766	Can you contact someone on the commercial side for help?
1766	Sara
1767	I would prefer to attach a "delivery schedule" and should have details shortly.
1767	Thanks.
1767	Sara
1768	For purposes of Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex, the term "Valuation Date" shall mean any Friday during the Term of this Transaction or the following Business Day if such day is not a Business Day.
1769	Attached are the three draft confirms: Please let me know if we can send.
1769	Sara
1770	are you handling?
1771	yes, you can call Laurel for details.
1772	please print the xcel document.

1773	please print the doc.
1773	SS
1774	Bob: attached is Melissa's update.
1774	She cannot meet this afternoon but we can grab her in the morning.
1774	Are you flexible in the a.m.?
1774	SS
1775	Laurel: Please update me on your discussion with Jean Naughton-Carr.
1775	Sara
1776	Thanks for looking over my shoulder!
1776	Sara
1777	All: I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.
1777	Who will be handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?
1777	I am told that this is a Q3 deal.
1777	Thanks.
1777	Sara Molly: I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master.
1777	Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank?
1778	I will need to leave the office at 5pm tomorrow.
1778	Sara
1779	Matthew: We have had some internal discussions regarding the appropriate Enron party to this master and have concluded that Enron Corp. (the parent of Enron North America Corp.) should be your counterparty.
1779	Does this change warrent any changes with respect to your comments?
1779	Sara
1780	Sam: Attached is the FINAL version of the CSFB futures agreement (by separate email I will send you the DRAFT).
1780	I've "eyeballed" it but please verify that all changes were accepted.
1780	I'll help with the application.
1780	Let's have Gary sign in the early a.m. (or tonignt, if possible) because CSFB cannot open the account this evening.
1780	Also, per my vm, we need to ensure that the traders on my email to you (from Ellen Su) appear on the authorized traders' list.
1780	Thanks.
1780	ps: I'm not going anywhere.
1780	However, I have a 5 pm conference call on the Alberta prepay.
1781	blackline CSFB for comparison
1782	Tanya: Rodney and Finley are reviewing the two existing Citibank masters (ECT/Nighthawk).
1782	Two swaps will be documented under the ECT/Citibank maste and two under the new Garden State master (Was Molly in the process of amending that master? She never returned my voice mail.).
1782	Rodney and/or Finley should call you.
1782	Sara
1783	one for me Jeff Blumenthal - tax Steve Douglas - tax Ryan Siurek - accounting (Global Finance)
1784	Bill: How do you feel about the comments, per my voice mail.
1784	Sara
1785	Bill: Here's the conference call number.
1785	THERE APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE RE: CASH COLLATERAL (see Item 11 under the "ISDA Schedules" section of the memo.
1786	check out the provisions in the memo about the guaranties
1787	here's the dial-in number if you want to call in to discuss the guaranty issues
1788	Attached is my suggested language.
1788	The confirms already provide for Market Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination purposes.
1788	Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.
1788	Please call.
1788	713-853-5620.
1788	Sara
1789	Rats!
1790	please print for me
1791	Bill: The attached memo was distributed to legal last week.
1791	We have had a number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial transactions (ranging from short term to quarterly) with governmentals.
1791	As you will see in the memo, the risks are significant.
1791	Please let me know if you have any questions.
1791	Sara
1792	The attached swaps have been delivered together with the proposal sheets to Lisa Mellencamp.
1793	Thanks for the catch!
1793	Sara
1794	Attached are revised commodity swap confirms.
1794	I didn't change the rate swap and we're still waiting for input from the bank.
1795	see attached
1796	John: Hi, there!
1796	As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further that I can do.
1796	That formation should happen today or tomorrow.
1796	With the actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are interested in transacting on.
1796	Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed.
1796	Please let me know if you have any further questions.
1796	Sara
1797	Stephanie and Sam need NYMEX calendars
1798	Sheila: Please send an email to Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford requesting agreements with Deutsche Bank Securities.
1798	Which Enron company(ies) are you requesting these agreements for?
1798	Stephanie Panus will be handling this broker.
1798	Thanks.
1798	Sara
1799	Sheila: Please make your request to Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford about the above agreement which John has requested.
1799	Thanks.
1799	SS
1800	no changes
1801	pls put on my calendar
1802	John: The "signature block" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done through the U.K. agent actually looks different.
1802	It should read something like "Company X, as agent for ENA", for example.
1802	Therefore, Insitnet needs to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the process of being drafted).
1802	You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet agreement will be utilized.
1802	However, Instinet needs to review the agency arrangement before proceeding.
1802	You are also correct about the ITG agreement.
1802	In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an executed agreement with POSIT.
1802	I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in writing.
1802	Thanks.
1802	Sara
1803	I hope this works - I tried to tie all to the specific confirms.
1804	Sam: Please let me know ASAP whether Jason should be marking the Deutsche docs based on Sheila's message!
1805	Mark: I know you'll eventually get to this message in the near future.
1805	Based on the VOLUME of activity, I would like to have a printer in my office if at all possible.
1805	Thanks.
1805	Sara
1806	need to enter new transaction, contacts, etc.
1807	All: I received another call from Gary Ordway asking for an ISDA and our GTC's.
1807	Has anyone ever done credit?
1807	Sara
1808	I know.
1808	You need to speak with me.
1808	Sara
1809	Melissa: It looks like we'll need GTC's for a yet to be named FP&L counterparty to do this daily call option (spread).
1809	Credit (Ed Sacks) knows about this deal.
1809	You may want to think about the format.
1809	Have we done this before?
1809	Did you work on the Moosehead (Merrill Lynch) deal?
1809	Sara
1810	I just received a message that the deal is in a "holding" pattern
1811	Brent: will you please respond to Martin.
1811	Thanks.
1811	SS
1812	Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.
1812	Please consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation accordingly: 1.
1812	I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.
1812	Before we eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in agreement as to how this swap will terminate.
1812	[Do we want partial terminations based upon partial asset sales?] 2.
1812	Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need to be sure that the word "sale" is sufficient.
1812	Should we use "financial close" or some other term of art?
1812	I have concerns that a sale may be contingent or subject to some waiting period.
1813	Stephanie: Are these identical to our docs?
1813	need to check ASAP
1814	Please let Rodney/Finley/Tanya know that Mary is assisting on the nego of the new Master.
1814	I'm here if issues arise.
1814	Also, who is minding the confirms?
1814	They need to be revised.
1815	ENA's master is with TD, New York Branch.
1815	Which branch are we dealing with?
1816	Yes, I'll be in Death Valley hoping that the weather is as gorgeous as it is today.
1816	Dinner sounds great but I can't get together until after my VACATION.
1816	So let's shoot for after October 15.
1816	By the way, I heard that Joe Manascalco died.
1816	Also, are you still interested in the LSU mineral law institutes?
1816	Have fun in N.O.
1816	Sara
1817	Scott: I just wanted to let you know that I am working on a number of quarter-end deals and haven't heard from anyone today about the ESA swap for Raptor 2.
1817	I WILL NOT BE IN THE OFFICE ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29.
1817	However, I will identify a lawyer to assist on this transaction should the need arise.
1817	I'll be back in the office on Monday.
1817	Sara
1818	I'm putting you on this file.
1818	Rod Nelson is credit - please add him onto Lotus Notes.

1819	Sara
1820	Paul: per my voice mail, please let me know if you or Rod will handle.
1820	The FX traders are hollering (on both sides of the Atlantic).
1820	I'd like to chat on Monday, October 2.
1820	Thanks.
1820	Sara
1821	Madhur and Aaron: I am waiting for a response from credit.
1821	Aaron: You had me confused because you kept referring to Morgan Stanley who we are negotiating with on the equity side.
1821	Who negotiated the So, this party trades FX and credit?
1821	Sara
1822	John: Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.
1822	The Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541).
1822	I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax lines were open.
1822	Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging that he never did the deal (the EOL "back office user" shows that the trade WAS done).
1822	Please let me know if you need legal assistance.
1822	Thanks.
1822	Sara
1823	Here are the only confims that I know of.
1824	I will take off the Monday and Tuesday PRIOR to Thanksgiving.
1824	Please advise if any problems.
1824	Sara
1825	John: I spoke with Kevin Meredith this morning.
1825	1) Trade Date was 9/11.
1825	EOL system generated confirm 9/12.
1825	All fax attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.
1825	2) EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).
1825	Duke volume extremely heavy as well.
1825	All Duke faxing unsuccessful.
1825	3) Duke called Kevin and said "haven't received any confirms since 9/14."
1825	Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.
1825	Duke makes no mention of confirms prior to 9/14.
1825	Confirm desk runs a "fax failed" report on 9/25 and picks up the missing confirm.
1825	4) When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.
1825	Miller says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.
1825	However, this deal shows up on the "back office user."
1825	Let me know if you need anything further.
1825	Kevin's number is 39555.
1825	Sara
1826	Fine with me.
1826	I will have to leave at 6 pm Houston.

1829	Joe: 2 more confirms (appear to be mixed up between RBC and Toronto Dominion.
1830	Final two draft confirms for RBC/ECC
1831	Tracy's address

1842	Who is performing legal/credit for Enovate?
1842	Sara
1843	Thursday I'll be there.
1844	All: Do you know anything about "Enovate" and whether we are preparing swap documentation for it?
1844	Sara
1845	Any idea what this is?
1846	Jason: please hold off on hedge funds for the moment.
1846	Paul may need to rethink the provisions.
1846	Sara
1847	I spoke with Kim and she would like for Tim to explain the rationale.
1847	He is traveling today.
1847	She thinks this provision "will not hurt" to have in the agreement since Harvard does not want to change its form!
1847	Also, why don't we say what type of entity Harvard is?
1847	I think it are created by Mass. state law.
1847	How does it go bankrupt?
1848	Attached is a revision to the original swap confirmation.
1848	I have tried to incorporate all of the concepts discussed yesterday.
1848	Please send comments or call (X35620).

1851	Any word yet on creation of the new entity?
1851	Sara
1852	Steve: Just thought I'd follow up since our conversation of 9/13 to see if you have had an opportunity to redraft the ISDA Schedule and CSA, and, whether you have reviewed the guaranty which Tana Jones delivered to you shortly thereafter.
1852	Please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-5620.
1852	I will be on vacation from Oct. 6 - Oct. 13.
1852	I look forward to hearing from you.
1852	Sara
1853	thanks.
1853	Can you provide me with the appropriate signature block for ENA/ECT Investments Inc. through the agent?
1854	Chris: What TYPE of counterparty are we dealing with here (i.e., corporate, municipal, individual, etc.)?
1854	I need to understand this before I send out a form.
1854	Sara
1855	Just so that you have a copy.
1855	Also, Steve will prepare a blackline and cc you.
1855	SS
1856	Clem: I gave y;our phone number to Steven Kessler who is the lawyer for Deutsche Bank ("DB") (in New York).
1856	You may recall that you and I spoke earlier about DB's insistence of NO WAITING period to call upon the guarantor (we reduced to two days).
1856	Please call Steve (212-469-8202) unless he calls you first.
1856	Thanks.
1856	Sara
1857	Stephanie: Per Chris's email below, please send a draft master (without a CSA) for a general corporate (and cc Chris).

1860	Just a reminder that I will be on vacation next week.
1860	I am thanking everyone in advance for your help on projects I may have been handling (or should have been handling!).
1860	Kaye will have phone numbers to reach me, if necessary.
1860	Sara
1861	Jason: She did call and wanted John, you and me.
1861	I am available untill roughly 11 am when the lawyers depart for the Woodlands.
1861	She indicated that this provision was necessary if we EVER decided to net physical/financial.
1861	(Jason: we won't agree to that now and if we ever did, I am sure we would either amend all of our masters or put a separate netting agreement in place).
1861	She did indicate that Harvard MIGHT drop the request.
1861	I don't particularly want the provision in the agreement.
1861	My calendar is open if you want to schedule.
1861	SS
1862	Scott: I only have comments from Ryan and Donette.
1862	Mark Spradling left me a message about five minutes ago and said that he would have comments tomorrow morning (and to copy Shelley Barber on any drafts).
1862	Once I receive comments, I'll prepare another draft and circulate.
1862	Sara
1863	I will be on vacation from October 6- 13.

1863	Thanks.
1863	Sara
1864	Scott: I need the Grizzly I account information.
1864	Thanks.
1864	Sara
1865	John: Per my voice mail.
1865	you need to insure that the right people in London keep me updated on execution and delivery of the appropriate service agreements to permit the U.K. arranger to act for both ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. Also, you need to advise me of new platforms you are seeking as well as CONTACT NAMES and PHONE/FAX numbers.
1865	In that regard, (1) What is Autex?
1865	You have never mentioned this one to me.
1865	(2) I am contacting Instinet but will need the agency agreement which was requested earlier.
1865	(3) I am reviewing ITGL/ITG Europe.
1865	(NOTE that Posit in the U.S. has no written arrangement with us) Thanks.
1865	Sara
1866	All: I will be on vacation until October 16, 2000.
1866	Because I am handling a large number of brokerage agreements and electronic trading platforms (for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.), I have asked Jason Peters with Andrews and Kurth (713-220-4124) to assist me.
1866	Some of the agreements are for John Greene who is currently in London and those agreements may reference English law and the Financial Services Acts.
1866	I have given Jason your names IN CASE he has any questions.
1866	Thanks for your help.
1866	Sara
1867	I'd stick with Anthony.
1867	I didn't think that Prudential was one of our clearing brokers (remember, the letter must come from our clearing broker).
1867	Please keep Mike Fowler and Paul Radous informed.
1867	Thanks.
1867	Sara
1868	Mark Taylor
1869	I'll leave you a voice mail.
1869	Thanks.
1869	sara
1870	Bill: To my knowledge, Enron Corp. has never provided a "true comfort letter" in these situations.
1870	ENE has written a vague letter of ENE's relationship to its sub.
1870	It is possible that the current ENE corporate viewpoint on providing "comfort letters" has changed.
1870	Let me know what you would like for me to do.
1870	SS
1871	These are not all my files.
1871	Some were Carol's, Mary picked up a Yosemite and perhaps Mark handled one or two.
1872	Tanya: I just returned from vacation.
1872	What happened with SITA?
1872	Did we execute a transaction (in the name of ECTRIC) on a Deemed ISDA (with or without credit?).
1872	I didn't see an entry in Lotus Notes.
1872	Sara
1873	I have not received a response from anyone.
1873	Sara
1874	The JV between ENA (or some Enron sub) and Peoples Energy Corporation is called Enovate.
1874	I was on a conference call this afternoon with Greg Penman, Molly Harris, Stacy Dickson and Kay Mann.
1874	The issues is WHO will negotiate ISDA's ffor the JV (and negotiate the basic ISDA between Peoples and the JV).
1874	You will recall that Haedicke did not want us to negotiate on behalf fo Bridgeline.
1874	Kay is meeting with Mark in about an hour and will raise these issues.
1874	SS
1875	Thanks!
1876	Attached is an ENA form of confirmation for a Gas Daily swap (documented under an executed ISDA Master Agreement).
1876	Sara
1877	Bill: The Enron Corp. board passed a resolution last week authorizing equity transactions on ENE stock.
1877	Clint and Jeff are anxious to proceed with the negotiation of ISDA Master Agreements with the parties we have been discussing.
1877	Please send credit to me for preparation of documentation.
1877	As always, please let me know if you have any questions.
1877	Thanks.
1877	Sara
1878	not me
1879	Do you have access to Lotus Notes?
1879	Serge told us on Oct. 3 that he would have comments no later thatn the week of 10/16 and you would follow up with him.
1879	I'll try to call you when I have a free minute.
1879	Sara
1880	Are you having second thoughts about this?
1881	Let's redline (or accept) Ryan's changes and redistribute.
1881	Thanks.
1881	Sara
1882	Jordan: Congratulations on your promotion!
1882	I am forwarding to ;you one of the Raptor 2 hedges which was to be finalized earlier this month.
1882	My most recent draft was dated October 5 and I never received comments until this morning (from Ryan Siurek) which prompted the revisions attached.
1882	Ryan is also expecting comments from Rodney Faldon.
1882	I don't know if you have been updated on the various Raptor swaps which have been created over the past few months.
1882	The attached is to hedge ESA assets.
1882	I'd be glad to give you a brief overview, as would Ryan.
1882	Thanks.
1882	Sara
1883	John: The Duke issue has arisen once again in connection with the settlements group.
1883	Did you ever resolve the issue?
1883	Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at 1:14 pm and the second at 1:28 pm.
1883	Duke agrees wtih the first trade but not the second.
1883	Please bring me up to date.
1883	Thanks.
1883	Sara
1884	Laurel: BNP Paribas is fine.
1884	Repos are on my list.
1884	Sara p.s.
1884	I had a great vacation!
1885	FYI - I spoke with Thomas Fay in NY about setting up Instinet in London.
1885	I HAVE BOTH INSTINET FILES IN MY OFFICE.
1885	Sam, I told Thomas that we do not need copies of any agreements.
1885	You must have been looking for them while I was on vacation.
1885	Remember, broker'futures agreements are in RED files to make them visible.
1885	SS
1886	here it is
1887	Clem: We have gone back and forth with Serge Martin who is negotiating for Florida P&L.
1887	I think that you need to contact him and have a conversation.
1887	If you prefer to give your negotiable comments to me, I'll be glad to move forward.
1887	We are finished with the ISDA.
1887	Thanks for your help.
1887	Sara
1888	Sam/Stephanie: Do we have an executed version for Global Contracts and our files?
1889	I would like to have this agreement executed during the week of Oct. 23.
1889	Please resolve with counterparty and discuss with me.
1890	Please fax the ORIGINAL confirm.
1890	Thanks.
1890	SS
1891	Sorry to be so picky here, but do we also have CSFB's signature?
1892	Please send update back to V&E.
1892	Note room change and YOUR NAME and info.
1892	Thanks.
1892	Sara
1893	Regarding Aneela's request for execution of an "Electronic Order Execution Agreement", please send your usual message to Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, etc. The agreement is drafted for execution by Enron Corp. Please identify the Enron trading signatory(ies).
1893	Thanks.
1893	Sara
1894	Brent: In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements, licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie and me) have established a "process" which includes the following: 1.
1894	sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and necessity for agreement 2.
1894	depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get involved.
1894	3.
1894	the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track the process.
1894	4.
1894	upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global contracts.
1894	To my knowledge, we have not established a procedure for tracking passwords (to the extent required/changed).
1894	I understand that Jason is handling three ENA weather license agreements for you (Risk Management Solutions,Inc., Foresight Weather LLC and Air Worldwide Weather).
1894	Jason has (or will have) access to Lotus Notes to enter his comments.
1894	Thanks.
1894	Sara

1896	Please forward docs to other persons who need to review.
1896	Thanks.
1896	Sara
1897	Paul: What is this deal from Russell Dyke?
1897	I'm baffled.
1897	Sara
1898	Susan: My fax numbers include:
1899	Tanya: SITA wants to know what is taking so long to finalize the ISDA!
1899	Also, I ran into Michael M. last night and he even asked!
1899	Do you know who is handling?
1899	Sara
1900	I am still waiting for a copy of the services agreement and the form of signature.
1900	Instinet is proceeding but will still require this information.
1900	Thanks.
1900	Sara
1901	Tracy: Netting (payment or closeout) only applies between the parties under a single master agreement.
1901	Are you asking about the right of setoff in the event of an early termination under one of the masters?
1902	I spoke with Steve Kessler this morning.
1902	He told me that he agreed with Carol to net commodity transactions (which was actually more than he wanted to agree to!).
1902	However, DB does not have the systems to net within other product groups.
1902	Sara
1903	Mary: Attached is an early draft of notice which I had prepared for the AVICI swap.
1903	I thnk we may changed the Termination provision of the confirm shortly after this was drafted.
1903	Hope this helps.
1903	Sara
1904	Jorge: You are trying to be too efficient!
1904	Just kidding, because I just had a conversation wtih the U.K tax person and the following issues remain unresolved but are in the process of being addressed: 1.
1904	credit.com payment, back-office and negotiation 2.
1904	Enron Japan trading (online/offline) 3.
1904	London online FX hedging 4.
1904	London equity hedging Sorry I can't give you any answers right now.
1904	All of these issues are tax-driven and are being addressed.
1904	Sara
1905	Jason: (1) You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the executing brokers) is mandatory.
1905	Have you heard anything?
1905	(2) Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?
1905	Are you still having problems connecting with him?
1905	Sara
1906	My schedule is currently open and I will make myself available to meet with Janine.
1906	Sara
1907	You are correct.
1907	By copy of this message, I will ask Tana to finalize.
1907	Sara
1908	Jason: Which files have you left messages for Mark Elliott?
1908	Have you emailed and phoned?
1908	Are you up and running on Lotus Notes?
1908	SS
1909	Mark: Just in case you're curious, attached is a listing of items Jason is handling for the group.
1909	I'm trying to keep track.
1910	All: Please let me know if something is missing from the attached list.
1910	Thanks.
1910	Sara
1911	I received a call from John Powell reuqesting copies of the agreements for transacting on EOL (for the legal department).
1911	He was asking about arbitration and other items.
1911	He didn't specifically ask for GTC's so you may want to inquire.
1911	Thanks.
1911	Sara phone 281/378-1114 fax 281/378-1151
1912	Louise: I received a call from Jeff Blumenthal (Houston tax) who would like to be included in the meeting.
1912	His availability is Friday only.
1912	Thanks.
1912	Sara
1913	A document entitled "Third Party Connection: Customer Profile" showed up in my inter-office mail.
1913	What is this in relation to?
1913	What company?
1913	Who requested?
1913	Why?
1913	Thanks.
1913	Sara
1914	Kaye: can you please print for me?
1914	what am I doing wrong?
1914	Sara
1915	Have you ever heard back from Liz Fernandez or Desiree Monroe?
1916	Sam: Please be sure to let Russell know when Cinergy goes out today.
1916	He should have sent you the addressee.
1916	Sara
1917	Jim: Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
1917	These two documents are intended to supplement the boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
1917	The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of specific negotiations.
1917	Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities appears to cover physical trading.
1917	Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and transactions thereunder.
1917	Additional information, including a legal opinion, is also required.
1917	I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession copies of the ISDA boilerplate.
1917	Please advise otherwise.
1917	You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral support documentation.
1917	As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not been customized.
1917	Please feel free to call if you have any questions.
1917	Sara
1918	Bill and Tanya: Clint would like to finalize Lehman and CSFB, in that order.
1918	We are in the midst of transferrring a swap from Merrill to Lehman.
1918	Thanks for your help.
1918	Sara

1920	Further to my earlier message, Deutsche Bank is third on the list.
1920	Thanks.
1920	Sara
1921	Hi, Thomas!
1921	I know that you're in London and I was just checking to see if I was to have received something from your NY office for me to sign.
1921	Please let me know.
1921	Thanks.
1921	Sara
1922	Tanya: Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for counterparties required to post guaranties.

1923	Sara
1924	Mark: Can I go ahead and give to Angela?
1924	Sara

1925	I will call in the morning to discuss and I hope we can finalize and fax signature tomorrow.
1925	Thanks.
1925	Sara
1926	All: I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk.
1926	I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be providing Kim with a list of "issues" and we have been invited to add to that list.
1926	Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.
1926	You may ignore the message below.
1926	Thanks.
1926	Sara

1929	Sara

1934	Muriel: Please add Angela Davis to this list.
1934	I believe her email is
1935	Steve: I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since our conversations in mid-September.
1935	I have only a "draft" confirmation dated May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further discussions.
1935	Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.
1935	FYI, I have not received comments from Mike Enerson.
1935	Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?
1935	Thanks.
1935	Sara
1936	fine with me - just verify final time and location.
1936	Sara
1937	If I finish my 9 am early, I'll call you.
1937	In any event, I'll find a way for us to hook up today or tomorrow.
1937	Sara
1938	Jason: Please let me know where we stand on this and what steps we are currently taking to finalize.
1938	On a different matter, I spoke with Mike Neves on Friday afternoon and we concluded that getting you hooked up to Lotus Notes was becoming too complicated.
1938	Please email your updates to me and I will enter onto Lotus Notes.
1938	Thanks.
1938	Sara P.S.
1938	I have approved all of your invoices for payment.

1942	thanks.
1942	ss
1943	Holly: We sent a draft ISDA to EWEB on 4/19/00 to the attention of Jim Origliosso.
1943	We have never heard a word.
1943	Please let me know what you need.
1943	Sara
1944	Tanya: This is the master referred to in my vm.
1944	Thanks.
1944	Sara

1945	transacting with municipals (esp. international) 4.
1945	trader education 5.
1945	electronic trading agreements and passwords (esp. unknown to legal)
1946	Also, see form II-B of the 2000 ISDA Definitions.
1947	Someone please explain.
1947	Sara
1948	Jim: I didn't know if Clint had already forwarded this to you.
1948	Sara
1949	Ryan: Here's the redraft of Lehman.
1949	THE CAP is something Clint and I want to discuss with you again.
1949	Sara
1950	Kaye: Please arrange for 30 minutes - 1 hour.
1950	Ask Laurel what she needs.
1950	Thanks.
1950	Sara
1951	I have two (2) tickets to the Friday, Nov. 3 performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" which I cannot attend.
1951	Let me know if you're interested - they're free.
1951	Sara
1952	I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning: What company actually employs John Greene?
1952	I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must sign a new confidentiality agreement for the UK terminal (for trading by ECT Investments, Inc. through its arranger Enron Investment Services Limited).
1952	Please advise by email or voice mail Thanks Sara
1953	Tanya: Bill was assigned to this master which we sent out in 1997.
1953	Per my email yesterday, we need new credit and a new person assigned.
1953	I think Rod will handle credit when we dupe the ENA master for Please let me know who will handle.
1953	There are some issues that credit and legal can determine before we resend a first draft.
1953	Thanks.
1953	Sara
1954	Please add "Angela Davis" to the distribution list (angela.davis@enron.com).
1954	Thanks.
1954	Sara
1955	These are all REPOS: Merrill Lynch Canada Inc./ENA Merrill Lylnch Govt.
1955	Securities Inc./Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith
1956	Andy: In the spirit of "full disclosure", I thought I would let you know what ENA has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities.
1956	ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95).
1956	There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).
1956	All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language (in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).
1956	All of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.
1956	I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I: change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time) delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required language delete the arbitration provision in its entirety I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that we can finalize docs by the afternoon.
1956	Thanks for your assistance.
1956	Sara
1957	Ellen: When you have a minute, give me a call and let's discuss, especially notice, assignability.
1957	The BIG ENRON issue is limited liability (I have no choice here).
1957	Setoff can be compromised with credit's approval (Paul Radous is credit).
1957	Sara
1958	Andy: I am reviewing your comments and will have an answer shortly.
1958	I thought, however, that you should know that the limitation of liability provision is non-negotiable from Enron's viewpoint.
1958	If this is problematic, please advise and we can halt further discussion.
1958	Thanks.
1958	Sara
1959	Julia: Could I please have a copy of the executed swap confirm?
1959	Thanks (especially for all of your help).
1959	Sara
1960	Yes, my preferance would be to ship to Texas.
1960	Please let me know.
1960	Did you receive the check?
1960	Sara
1961	Attached is a blackline containing Enron Corp. comments to your latest draft.
1961	Please contact Clint Freeland and me to coordinate execution.
1961	Thanks.
1961	Sara
1962	Mary: you may want to see the registration comments offered by Jim Armogida in the attached doc.
1962	SS
1963	Visit their website at: www.vintageestate.com Monday, November 20, I have scheduled the following appointments: Beginning at 4 pm: Deb - facial, then massage Sara- massage, then facial Steve- massage, then !!!!!!!!!!!!
1963	Villagio does not have reflexology.
1963	I didn't know if Steve wanted a facial (but if he does, there is no one to do the facial at 5!) Seriously, check their website for other services for Steve (and you).
1963	I was only trying to time all of our services together, but that may not be entirely necessary.
1963	I don't know what time dinner is on Monday but I'm assuming it is late enough to allow us to change clothes and shower (and wash hair if we feel like it).
1963	The spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on Sunday.
1963	So we can make changes.
1963	This is particularly important since all changes must be made within 24 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card.
1963	And I really hate unnecessary charges.
1963	On a slightly different note, I am compiling places I'd like to visit since we have no itinerary.
1963	Then we can have a tribal meeting to vote.
1963	Big Tiger Feather has changed his plans to stay until Tuesday so we'll have two cars.
1963	Bye now!
1963	Love, Sas (the future Miss America over FFFFFFFFFFFFF)
1964	Paul: Please let me know if you can be available for a conference call with Jason on Friday to discuss Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley Cap Services.
1964	Thanks.
1964	Sara
1965	Please reassign this file this morning and ask the responsible paralegal to bring the file in my office to discuss.
1965	Thanks.
1965	Sara
1966	Paul: We'll meet Friday at 2 pm to call Jason.
1966	Can you come up to my office?
1966	Sara
1967	Do you have a paralegal yet?
1968	It seems as though yesterday's email didn't reach anyone.
1968	Attached is the redline.
1968	With the exception of numbers (cap, price,etc) I think we are ready to speak with Merrill.
1968	Sara
1969	Bart: Sorry to get to you so late in the day.
1969	I am attaching the FORM of the Catalytica swap and option.
1969	I do not have executed copies.
1969	Sara
1970	I would like to take Friday, Dec. 8 as a vacation day.
1970	Please advise of any conflicts.
1970	Sara
1971	Hey, Carol!
1971	November 15 looks like a great day.
1971	Any other day (except Friday) could work.
1971	Sara
1972	Susan: Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
1972	We have agreed to delete the CSA and will return a blackline to you shortly.
1972	You may recall that SITA expressly requested that the Enron agreement be governed by English law which is why we prepared this document for execution by our affiliate in London with the jurisdiction language appearing in the prior draft.
1972	There are still issues posed by your markup and we should be able to schedule a conference call next week.
1972	Thanks.
1972	Sara
1973	FYI - we will be negotiating this master.
1973	Sara
1974	We may find out today so hold the Master.
1974	We are waiting for Lehman to revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to "clean up" behind his attorney to make sure that there are really not any other changes to the Schedule!
1974	Paul has been traveling for the last two days and should be back in the office today.
1974	Clint Freeland (our trader) will let us know more.
1974	SS
1975	Pat: I am a financial trading attorney with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") in the Houston office.
1975	Christian Yoder gave me your name and suggested that we speak regarding the EWEB transaction.
1975	I will be negotiating the ISDA Master Agreement with EWEB, probably with Jmi Deason directly.
1975	ENA requires that governmentals provide specific evidence of authority to enter into derivative instruments (including certified resolutions specifically authorizing execution of the master agreement and all transactions thereunder, legal opinion and additional reps/warranties).
1975	I was curious as to the specific documentation you had reviewed from EWEB.
1975	It sounded from your email which Christian forwarded to me, that you were reviewing evidence of authority to enter into physical transactions.
1975	I would like to speak with you directly, if possible.
1975	I am in a Central time zone and my direct line is (713) 853-5620.
1975	I look forward to speaking with you.
1975	Thanks.
1975	Sara
1976	addresss correction
1977	here's the political decision helper -
1978	Russell: I spoke briefly with Paul about your long-dated commodity deal and have a few comments.
1978	(1) Have you spoken with anyone on the confirmation desk about preparing a draft confirm?
1978	Joe Hunter (X33316) is a good start.
1978	(2) Paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and CSFB Int'l (name change from Credit Suisse Financial Products).
1978	In that regard, you should be sure to add the following items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty: (a) ENA should be the Calculation Agent for purposes of this transaction.
1978	(b) You should provide for "Payments on Early Termination" as: "For the purpose of Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement, (i) Loss will apply, and (ii) the Second Method will apply."
1978	Also, you should obtain evidence of the name change (usually a certificate of name change).
1978	Let me know if you have any questions.
1978	Thanks.
1978	Sara
1979	FYI - this is the proposed Schedule which we will review and comment; EWEB did not send a CSA.
1979	Sara
1980	Surprise!
1980	Tax does not yet have an answer.
1980	But I'll call you anyway.
1980	Sara
1981	OK, you guys, I'm trying my best.
1981	All appointments on Monday, November 20 have been moved to 3 P.M.
1981	Deb: facial, then massage Steve: 80 minute wellness massage Steve: the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought you'd like a longer massage.
1981	There are facial appointments available Sunday morning and afternoon.
1981	You may want to check the website and change the service.
1981	You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and I'll take yours.
1981	Let me know if you'd like for me to make changes.
1981	Otherwise, see you in wineland.
1981	Sara
1982	Did anyone work on the Destec transaction?
1982	Sara
1983	Susan: How about any of Wednesday - Friday, Nov.8, 9 or 10?
1983	Houston is on Central Std.
1983	Time.
1983	Let me know.
1983	Sara
1984	FYI - I'll talk to you in a little while because we"ll redline EWEB's document. Sara
1985	Please see the attached Schedule and look at Part 3 (Documents to be delivered) under the headings for Party B (which is EWEB):
1986	Hey, guys: I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England and Wales.
1986	I believe that Michael drafted originally.
1986	(1) submission to English courts and waiver of all objections (2) setoff for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?
1986	Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal Tuesday, Nov. 7.
1986	Thanks.
1986	Sara
1987	Good morning!
1987	Thanks for your help yesterday.
1987	Would you please CALL A&K and make sure that they add Angela Davis to the distribution?
1987	Thanks.
1987	Sara
1988	Jane: If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.
1988	In a nutshell, we provide that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally a MAC in the CSA).
1988	John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).
1988	I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.
1988	Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.
1988	I look forward to hearing from you.
1988	Regards.
1988	Sara
1989	Yes.
1989	I thought you understood as much from our meeting.
1989	I have asked A&K repeatedly to add you to the email list.
1989	Also, it was my understanding from Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the "structured" equity derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).
1989	Please let me know if I'm assuming too much.
1989	Thanks.
1989	Sara
1990	Holly: I'll try to get something to EWEB today.
1990	Also, we don't prepare deemed ISDA's for muni's so I have to create a form.
1990	Sara
1991	Hey, Lawyer Daigle: On November 17, I'll be exercising my wheelchair along the winding roads of Napa and Sonoma Valleys.
1991	However, would you two kids be interested in the more popular seminar at Galatoires on Dec. 8, entitled "Dot.com for Seniors", 3 hours CLE credit requested?
1991	Please let me know as soon as possible so that I can request my cheap senior fare on Southwest Airlines, a reduced rate rental car and other freebies afforded through the AARP.
1991	Sara Please respond to pkdaigle
1992	Janine: Thank you for scheduling the meeting last week.
1992	Let me know if I can be of any help whatsoever.
1992	Also, whatever flowcharts or schematics you can offer would greatly appreciated, as well as a list of services agreements.
1992	Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on EOL.
1992	Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal hedging FX products for London and Japan.
1992	Am I correct in the following?
1992	RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing services agreements.
1992	ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.
1992	Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the situation should arise?) Thanks.
1992	Sara
1993	Andy: Attached are my blacklined comments to the prior draft.
1993	Please let me know if this works.
1993	Thanks.
1993	Sara
1994	Jane: the ISDA jurisdiction and waiver of jury trial language is fine.
1994	Sara
1995	You lucky dog!!!!!!!!!!!!
1996	David: Pursuant to our conversation, attached is my blackline.
1996	I'll verify jurisdiction.
1996	Thanks.
1996	Sara
1997	We're done.
1997	I should have signed docs tomorrow.
1997	Sara
1998	Angela: Will you be available?
1998	I was hoping that you can handle these deals with swap group assistance.
1998	Please feel free to call upon me at any time.
1998	Thanks.
1998	Sara
1999	Dale: do you still want to meet?
1999	Are you waiting to receive Janine's email tomorrow?
1999	Can I buy you lunch one day?
1999	Sara

2001	I have faxed already to Leslie and Gary.
2001	I will fax to you if you would please send me your email address.
2001	Thanks.
2001	Sara
2002	Not really.
2002	I usually ask to be conferenced in when the swap is discussed, give my comments to Danny Sullivan only (if A&K is outside counsel) or listen to as much as I need to.
2002	It's really your call.
2002	SS
2003	John: Have you seen this?
2003	Please call me.
2003	Sara

2014	Thursday is Nov. 16.
2015	Leslie: Per our conversation, you mentioned that you had comments to the form of assignment to be executed by you, Lehman and Enron North America Corp..

2016	I look forward to hearing from you.
2016	Thanks.

2020	continuing guaranty is fine 2.

2020	He returns tomorrow.
2020	Thanks.
2020	Sara
2021	Your diagram identifies "Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto".
2021	Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA agreement?
2021	Did the bank change its name?
2021	I'll wait for the term sheet and the draft TD confirms which you mentioned in your email.
2021	Sara
2022	FYI
2023	Clem: Would you please contact Susan Hopkinson about the guaranty.
2023	She works in Paris and her phone number is 33 1 53 67 4747.
2023	Thanks.
2023	Sara ps I have separtely emailed to you the blacklined guaranty.
2024	Brent: I wanted to inquire about SMUD.
2024	After the legal/credit meeting, it sounded as though special deal language was going into the Schedule as opposed to the confirm for the Transaction.
2024	Thanks.
2024	Sara
2025	I was looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and hope that we can arrange something soon.
2025	I'm not sure about my plans during the Thanksgiving holiday but I think I'll be spending most of it in Houston.
2025	I am taking a long weekend (this weekend) in Napa with my sister, brother-in-law and Mike to celebrate my birthday so I'm anticipating somewhat of an eating exttavaganza.
2025	Talk to you soon.
2025	Sara
2026	All: PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS PREPAY (1) The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted master.
2026	It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not necessarily market (or ENA) standard.
2026	It should be reviewed immediately by legal and credit.
2026	(2) The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.
2026	IT IS NOT AN ISDA .
2026	It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to simple transactions and commodities).
2026	The terminology is not even ISDA terminology.
2026	This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for upgrading to an ISDA.
2026	Rod: You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement now and we should discuss.
2026	Treasa: Will there be a rate swap?
2026	Under which master(s)?
2027	Didn't we send this out?
2027	SS
2028	Hey, Russell: Are you handling the "Cargill-Alliant, LLC" credit?
2028	Sara
2029	There are TWO (2) Enron affiliates having master agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG"): (1) ECTRIC has an ISDA Master Agreement with MSCG dated 3/25/99 but effective as of 8/29/97 (2) ECT (now ENA) has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with MSCG dated, and effective, as of 6/16/92 With respect to the TD (TEXAS) master agreement having a "RESTRICTED" status, I will need to speak with Rod Nelson.
2029	Sara
2030	Rod: You need to speak with Treasa.
2031	Here it is
2032	Bob: I'm only sending this message so that you can see all correspondence.
2032	This doc will be useful to you.
2033	this is from Jason
2034	Kevin: This is set to close tomorrow (so far!).
2034	Please look this first draft over to see if you have any issues.
2034	Thanks.
2034	Sara
2035	ENA and ECTRIC have masters with this counterparty.
2035	I NEED THESE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPAY ORIGINATING FROM LONDON WHICH CLOSES TOMORROW.
2035	These are both missing from the files.
2035	Does anyone have these?
2035	Please contact me ASAP!
2035	Thanks.
2035	Sara
2036	I guess "working it out"?
2036	The collateral piece will take a little time and we'll have to run it by Japanese counsel.
2037	Do you have a deal diagram?
2037	Is there a commodity swap between ENA and Morgan?
2037	The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding "loan repayment" and the "fee".
2037	Has Matt seen this?
2037	Shouldn't this be in a separate document?
2037	Also, I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the Master?).
2037	Do want TD to be the Calc.
2037	Agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap?
2037	Are you satisfied wtih the Disruption Fallback (which is the same as the Master but for the reduction in Postponement from 5 to 3 days).
2037	I am trying to speak with Rod.
2037	Sara
2038	Marcus: The MSCG Master is NOT AN ISDA!
2038	I am sure there will be problems "matching" terms for the swaps.
2038	sara
2039	here's the email
2040	Angela: I just received this email from Carol.
2040	Do you know about this?
2040	It's the first I've seen (unless it's related to something that Mary is working on).
2040	Would you please follow up?
2040	It's coming from A&K.
2040	Thanks.
2040	Sara Second message to follow
2041	Here's the second message.
2042	Hi, Greg: Per my voice mail, could you please email or fax the final confirms to me?
2042	Thanks.
2042	Sara
2043	Bob: Would you please handle?
2043	Thanks.
2043	Sara
2044	Carol and Mary: I am not available on 12/8.
2044	Sara
2045	Now do you see what's going on?
2046	Kaye: I need for you to redline the first attached doc.
2046	I have the markup in my office.
2046	I need to email it tonight.
2046	Thanks.
2046	Sara
2047	Matt Dawson in London was inquiring about this agreement.
2047	He'll want to know when we are finished because he has a London paper trader nagging him.
2047	SS
2048	Marcus: TD has scheduled a conference call with me at 10:30 am Houston time to discuss the crude swap (related to the prepay).
2048	Mataly Sahoni (?) said that they wanted to discuss some "credit issues" and that it was "no big deal."
2048	You are welcome to join me.
2048	Sara P.S.
2048	Bob Bruce (Ext. 57780; EB 3880D) will back me up while I am out of the office tomorrow afternoon, Monday and Tuesday.
2048	I'll be back on Wednesday, Nov. 22.
2049	Yes, because Treasa told me this morning that this could "make or break the deal"!
2049	Of course, you are absolutely welcome to join me (and Marcus if he is available).
2049	Sara
2050	Attached is my markup of the TD crude confirm which I received this morning.
2050	Sara
2051	Here we go again!!!!!!!!!!!
2052	Please assign in the morning for preparation on Friday, Nov. 17.
2052	Whoever receives needs to call Chris Foster in Portland to coordinate.
2052	Thanks.
2052	sara
2053	Please join the conference call at 11;30 am New York time
2054	THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2055	WE ARE ALSO CONFERENCING AT 10:30 am Houston time!
2056	You bet!
2056	Belated to you.
2056	I'm off to Napa in a few hours to celebrate.
2056	I'll call after T-giving.
2056	Sara
2057	Have a great holiday.
2057	I'm out of here!!!!!!!!!!
2058	I am finalizing the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement with SITA.
2058	You will recall that this is an ECTRIC; master NOT ENA.
2058	SITA has (1) requested evidence of EEFT's ability to sign for ECTRIC and (2) confirmation that "EEFT is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services directive".
2058	Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows: Susan Hopkinson and Sharon Lewis at Lovells in Paris: If you require phone or fax: Please let me know when you have satisfied this request.
2058	Thanks.
2058	Sara
2059	Richard: I don't know if you were copied separately on this message.
2059	Can you send a letter after Thanksgiving?
2059	The first payment should come due the first week in December.
2059	Thanks.
2059	Sara
2060	Tanya: SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the Euro.
2060	They will not agree to USD.
2060	[By the way, SITA's lawyers had already agreed to USD] Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).
2060	What do you want to do?
2060	Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.
2060	Sara
2061	Treasa: Bob Bruce told me that there was no "swap" activity on the prepay during my absence.
2061	Houston is closed down until Monday, Nov. 27 for the Thanksgiving holiday.
2061	Normally, I would ask Joe Hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the confirms.
2061	I marked up the TD confirm to reflect my comments and provide an attached "schedule" of volumes since I thought it would be easier for you to match calc periods, volumes and rate payment dates.
2061	Such a format has worked well in other prepaid structures.
2061	If I don't go out of town tomorrow, you can reach me at home.
2061	My number is
2062	Richard Sage, CFO for EnronCredit.com, would like a link to be able to access Lotus Notes.
2062	Could you please arrange?
2062	Thanks.
2062	Sara
2063	Richard: It was good to meet you this afternoon.
2063	Attached is my Q&A for the traders regarding the U.S. concept of "Eligible Swap Participant".
2063	Let me know if I can be of further help.
2063	Also, I asked Tana Jones to send you the link for our Financial Trading Lotus Notes database.
2063	Sara
2064	Are we meeting at noon?
2064	Can I assume that Lawyer Burlingame will procure a table at the seminar?
2064	Sara Please respond to pkdaigle
2065	Jeff: If you don't have an answer yet, try to call Jeff Hodge.
2065	Sara
2066	Tanya: This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.
2066	We are also seeing lots of prepays.
2066	Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?
2066	Should we immediately involve you and Bill?
2066	At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are juggling the deals.
2066	Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.
2066	Thanks.
2066	Sara
2067	Did you have your questions answered?
2067	I have a voice mail from Philip Levy and need to respond.
2067	Please give me a call after Thanksgiving.
2067	Thanks.
2067	Sara
2068	He is a lawyer for APEA.
2068	Can I call him and let him know that the confirm was sent to APEA?
2068	When was it sent?
2068	Sara
2069	Please note regarding "finance deals, prepays".
2070	Stephanie: Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!
2070	Please follow up with this guy.
2070	Looks like he's in London.
2070	We need to verify that he's with Harvard, either through Caroline or asking that he send a faxed request so that we can see the letterhead, etc. Also, please keep track of the fully executed master.
2070	Thanks.
2070	Sara
2071	Teresa: I'll be helping you on the swap piece.
2071	Let me know what you need.
2071	Thanks.
2071	Sara
2072	I have not forgotten.
2072	No need to waste your time leaving me both a voice mail and an email.
2072	Thanks.
2072	Sara
2073	Jane: Sorry for the delay.
2073	I'm preparing a "cash only, two-way" section for the ISDA.
2073	I will try to get it to you this week.
2073	Sara
2074	Travis: I received this on 11/17 and I was on vacation.
2074	I think it's too late to respond but let me know.
2074	Sara
2075	Jane: I forgot to mention that I will need to have our Japanese outside counsel review the "credit section."
2075	Who should I be dealing with?
2075	Sara
2076	Thursday sounds great!
2076	I'll call you in the morning.
2076	Sara
2077	Sam: Please move the CSFB Futures Agreement to the "Futures Agreement" section of the database.
2077	Thanks.
2077	Sara
2078	FYI
2079	please print
2080	Jeff: Per my voice mail, please see the attached.
2080	Are you the point person for EnronCredit.com Ltd and debt trading?
2080	Sara
2081	Diana: I negotiated the Enron North America Corp. ISDA Master Agreement with the "President and Fellows of Harvard University" (together with John Suttle).
2081	Harvard is interested in metals trading.
2081	What is the entity trading metals (financial)?
2081	Will you evaluate the credit?
2081	Please let me know.
2081	Thanks.
2081	Sara
2082	FYI
2083	FYI re: my voice mail
2084	Richard: I have spoken with Jeff Blumenthal (US tax) about your request as I think he would be better suited to provide your advice.
2084	Jeff cannot make your conference call tomorrow but I have forwarded to him this message and your diagrams from last week.
2084	If you could provide Jeff with a short description of any issues, he will be glad to respond this week.
2084	Thanks.
2084	Sara New meeting request from Richard Sage 11/28/2000 10:00 AM Local Time 11/28/2000 11:00 AM Local Time Title: New US Entities (Denis's office) Location: -No room information available- Chair: Richard Sage/LON/ECT To (required): David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT, Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT, Rod cc (optional): Erica Gut/LON/ECT Discuss implications of implementing entities of the attached.
2085	Susan: CSFB had a name change earlier this year.
2085	Can you please see that the blue file is changed?
2085	Also, please let the other paralegals know what to do in an instance such as this.
2085	Thanks.
2085	sara
2086	I would like to add Dec. 7 as a vacation day.
2086	Please let me know if there are any problems.
2086	Thanks.
2086	Sara
2087	Chris: Sorry I missed you yesterday.
2087	Can we talk after 3 pm Houston time today?
2087	Just let me know.
2087	Thanks.
2087	Sara
2088	I am tied up this morning.
2088	SS
2089	Susan: Why is the RMT/NNG on hold?
2089	A two-year deal was booked in mid-November and we'd like to confirm under a master.
2089	Thanks.
2089	Sara
2090	John: I don't know if you've been in touch with Instinet but they are now holding up the documents.
2090	Instinet could not find the ECT Investments, Inc. executed 1997 agreements (which I have resent to them) and I now have their lawyer agreed to amend that agreement to add the London terminal.
2090	This should be a minor item.
2090	Can you put pressure on New York?
2090	Sara
2091	Please add "Robert Bruce" to the distribution list (either Bob or I will be available to assist from ENA legal).
2091	Also, please keep Cathy Moehlman (ENA Treasury - X33353) in the loop as she calls us for information that we may not have.
2091	Thanks.
2091	Sara
2092	Mark: Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.
2092	At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal should handle Enovate legal work.
2092	That work currently consists of establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.
2092	It is not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).
2092	Bill Bradford will have the final word on Enovate credit.
2092	Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.
2092	Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master agreements?
2092	Or should we just handle as any other project?
2092	Sara
2093	Laurel: Looks like this is being handled properly.
2093	You just need to stay on top of it.
2093	SS
2094	Please let me know who handles this one.
2094	Our power trader is Joe Wagner (X33143) and the draft should be emailed to John Porter: japorter@tva.gov Joe would like an update.
2094	John Porter will direct to a TVA lawyer.
2094	Thanks.
2094	Sara
2095	Jim: Thanks for following up.
2095	Sara
2096	Joe: Susan Bailey (X34737) will be drafting the TVA master.
2096	I don't think it will go out today; maybe, tomorrow.
2096	Please feel free to call Susan (or me) if you have any questions.
2096	Negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name, phone number and email address for the counterparty's LAWYER (I know you tried!).
2096	If the counterparty is truly anxious to trade, the commercial guys will pressure the legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball rolling.
2096	Otherwise, things will sit around and go nowhere.
2096	Just remember that an ISDA negotiation is USUALLY longer with a governmental entity because ENA requires more information (legal opinion, copies of statutes, authority in the form of a full Board resolution, etc.) and government lawyers may be short staffed.
2096	Sometimes the counterparty will hire outside counsel which may go more quickly, but not always.
2096	If a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading documents, the negotiations may end within a week (but I have never seen this happen with a governmental).
2096	Otherwise, it simply depends on the issues.
2096	Sara
2097	Can you be more specific?
2097	Is this for ENA?
2097	What type of products?
2098	Susan: Here's some more TVA information.
2098	sara
2099	FYI
2100	Please add your outstanding guaranties to Susan's memo - thanks
2101	Jim: As a follow up to our conversation of yesterday, please note the following: (1) I have not received your comments to our blackline of EWEB's ISDA Schedule.
2101	(2) I have not received your suggested language to the Deemed ISDA confirmation.
2101	Please verify whether or not you emailed these to me yesterday as promised.
2101	Also, Holli Krebs has offered to try to organize a conference call to discuss the Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
2101	Tracy Ngo from our credit group and I will be available to answer any questions.
2101	As soon as we have your comments, I can provide you with a blackline.
2101	Please let me know if there is anything further that I can do.
2101	Thanks.
2101	Sara
2102	Dennis: You have attached a form of confirmation for a very specialized derivative transaction, namely, a CREDIT derivative.
2102	The transaction that Enron and So.
2102	Cal.
2102	would be executing would be a COMMODITY derivative (that commodity being power).
2102	The confirmation format is similar.
2102	I will send you an example later.
2102	Sara
2103	Attached is the Schedule we sent and Par.
2103	13.
2104	Attached are Jim Deason's comments to the Schedule and Deemed ISDA.
2104	Please note him comments re: enforceability of this financial deal.
2105	Attached is the latest listing of executed equity agreements.
2105	We have a separate listing for futures agreements but the brokers are different from equity brokers.
2106	Dennis: Attached are two "templates" for power trades confirmed under an executed ISDA Master Agreement, one is for a swap and the other for an option (cap or floor).
2106	Ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms into our confirmation system.
2106	The specific terms of each trade (dates, notional quantities, price indexes and pricing, etc.) would be inserted into the format.
2106	I hope this helps.
2106	Sara
2107	Thanks
2108	Do you also have fax and email address?
2109	Laurel: Jason is ready to send comments on this agreement requested by John Greene.
2109	Can you please provide Jason with the name, address, fax number of the party with whom we should be communicating in order to negotiate this agreement.
2109	If you need to speak with Jason, you can call him at (713) 220-4124.
2109	Thanks.
2109	Sara
2110	Please confim that this file is currently inactive.
2110	Thanks.
2110	Sara
2111	Sheila: Please verify whether we need to pursue this agreement.
2111	Thanks.
2111	Sara
2112	Jason: I believe you have this agreement as well.
2112	Can you bring me up to date?
2112	Thanks.
2112	sara
2113	Clem: After our legal credit meeting yesterday, we noted that the following guaranties have not yet been executed: Mieco Inc. The Wiser Oil Company Would you please let me know when these will be executed?
2113	Thanks.
2113	Sara
2114	per my voice mail
2115	Of course not!
2115	Therefore, rank it LOW.
2116	Chris: We need to discuss the alternative to SP-15.
2116	Please see the redline where I have incorporated a "Fallback Reference Price".
2116	However, the definition is still vague.
2116	SS
2117	This should do it except that I would add a heading "DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY" at the top and fix the Fallback Reference Price format and put the phrase "as published in ... caliso.com" at the end of the sentence.
2118	I will attend.
2119	Jorge: (1) Yes, I did verbally approve the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section of the rate swap (10/26/00 deal).
2119	(2) Yes, I received your Fax of 11/21/00 from Bank of Montreal with your email to the bank.
2119	The language which you sent to the Bank of Montreal ("BOM") was to be based on the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section of the above rate swap.
2119	In that regard, (i) you inadvertently left out a phrase when you retyped the Merrill Lynch language.
2119	However, BOM's subsequent revision is acceptable.
2119	(ii) it is not clear to me whether ALL of Paragraph 3 in the original BOM confirm is being replaced.
2119	Your message to BOM seems to imply that it is fully replaced (which is what we want).
2119	You should definitely verify that this is the case in your latest BOM confirm.
2119	(3) Yes, the Termination Agreement format from Deutsche Bank AG looks fine.
2119	Just be sure that all transaction references are correct.
2119	Sorry for the delay.
2119	I am trying to identify another lawyer to back me up.
2119	Sara
2120	Attached is an updated list of brokerage agreements under negotiation.
2120	Please let me know of any changes.
2120	Sara
2121	Tanya: Is Lee the right person to approve this change for SITA?
2121	Remember, SITA is acutally with ECTRIC (nto ENA) and SITA wanted to settle in Euros.
2121	Thanks.
2121	Sara
2122	Of course.
2122	You probably forgot that SITA requested both settlement'termination in Euros.
2122	SS
2123	Does anyone have this file?
2123	The master was executed on 2/28/92.
2123	Thanks.
2123	Sara
2124	Steve: I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark Tarkington discussed the use of "Specified Entity" and agreed, subject to DB committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and affiliated masters with DB (i.e., "Specified Entity: none").
2124	Once you have confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.
2124	In connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format comments.
2124	[She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and password applications for London and U.S. based trading.] The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements with DB: (1) ECT Investments, Inc. (Delaware corporation) (2) Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (Delaware corporation)
2125	Love,
2126	Can I take a quick look at the BofA file?
2126	Thanks.
2126	Sara
2127	FYI only.
2127	We will execute the Lehman ISDA Master Agreement shortly.
2127	Sara
2128	ED: what is this all about?
2128	Sara
2129	Tracy: Please be sure to copy Melissa Murphy because she will be preparing the confirmation.
2129	Stephanie Panus will be the assisting paralegal.
2129	Thanks.
2129	Sara
2130	Stephanie: Please see me so that we can finalize.
2130	Sara
2131	Tom: SITA may be anxious but their lawyers raised a few new issues that we are responding to.
2131	Also, we have not finalized the Enron Corp. guaranty.
2131	Sara
2132	Please put me on the list for a flu shot.
2132	My ext.
2132	is 35620.
2132	Thanks.
2132	Sara
2133	Larry: According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).
2133	If NY trader is also involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, etc. The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.
2133	I don't know how long this takes.
2133	You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.
2133	Thanks.
2133	Sara
2134	Shari: It sounds great but I'm taking a few days off and won't be in town.
2134	Thanks.
2134	Sara
2135	Jason: Where do we stand with respect to this party?
2135	Sara
2136	Stephanie: There's no Municipal deal (remember Friday?).
2136	SS
2137	Do you have the original file or do we have it here?
2137	Enron Corp. wants to have this in place for equity trading.
2137	I can look at it quickly and perhaps shorten the response time.
2138	Of course.
2138	Sara
2139	Mary: Thanks so very much!
2139	And you're absolutely right about it being a good day!
2139	Sara
2140	Soma: Let me know when you'd like to further discuss.
2140	I'm attaching a short recap.
2140	I have copies of the referenced collateral annexes in my office for you.
2140	Sara
2141	Marcello: By way of introduction, I am a lawyer with Enron North America Corp.("ENA") in the derivatives area.
2141	I have read your memorandum of March 17, 1997 which was prepared for us and which addressed both physical and financial trading issues.
2141	I am also aware of the recent memo which you prepared for Brent Hendry re: internet trading.
2141	I have two (2) followup questions for you limited specifically to financial trading (NOT VIA INTERNET): (1) Do you have any changes to add to your memo of March 17, 1997 with respect to financial trading?
2141	(2) Would you modify ENA's Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (which I believe Brent Hendry recently forwarded to your attention)?
2141	I look forward to hearing from you.
2141	ENA is about to execute a trade with a Chilean corporate and I will most likely see the trade confirmation in the next day or so.
2141	You can reach me via email or by phone at (713) 853-5620.
2141	Thank you very much.
2141	Sara
2142	Susan: Please hold for EWEB redraft.
2142	SS
2143	(1) The Alcoa lawyer wants to adopt the terms of the ENA/Alcoa Inc. master for purposes of the December deal.
2143	(2) EWEB has requested the following provision: DEFAULT RATE shall mean the lesser of (a) the per annum rate of interest equal to the prime lending rate as may from time to time be published in "the Wall Street Journal" under "Money Rates" on such day (or if not published on such day the most recent preceding day on which published), plus two percent (2%) but not to exceed in total fourteen percent (14%) annually, and (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
2143	Please let me hear from you.
2143	Sara
2144	Bob: Attached is a draft "forward template" for circulation by Enron Corp. to potential counterparties.
2144	I based the template on the Lehman Bros. forward transaction (which I will fax to you separately).
2144	Per our discussion, please take a look at the template from Enron's viewpoint and suggest improvements, comments, etc. Enron Corp. has a potential counterparty in the wings and I would like to send out the template tomorrowl Please call me with your questions.
2144	As always, thanks for your help.
2144	Sara
2145	RE: Alcoa - it's a one-month deal.
2145	The issue is no netting absent a SINGLE agreement governing ALL trades.
2145	Please respond about ALCOA and EWEB.
2145	I'll be out Thursday and Friday.
2145	Sara
2146	I'll be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.
2146	In my absence please contact Bob Bruce.
2146	Thanks.
2146	Sara
2147	Melissa: I finally reached Tom Seligson and he will change the guaranty (below) to add that ENA may assign the guaranty to any affiliate without the approval of the guarantor.
2147	The remaining issue is whether to confirm on our omnibus or create a confirm and adopt by reference the provisions of the Alcoa Inc./ENA master.
2147	I have left Ed Sacks a message.
2147	Sara ps I will be out of the office on Dec. 7,8
2148	Jim: I was hoping that we could speak sometime today as I will be out of the office Dec. 7 and 8.
2148	I would like to discuss your comments the Schedule and receive your blackline to the Credit Support Annex.
2148	I am available all day except between the hours of 10 am - 2 pm (Houston time).
2148	I look forward to hearing from you.
2148	Regards.
2148	Sara
2149	Mark: I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf of ECTRIC.
2149	I need your able assistance with respect to the following: (1) SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the Agreement.
2149	Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a power of attorney to do so.
2149	(2) SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of ECTRIC.
2149	I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.
2149	SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.
2149	Her phone is 33153 674747 and fax is 33147 239612 and email is susan.hopkinson@lovells.com.
2149	I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.
2149	Stephanie Panus if assisting with the file.
2149	I look forward to hearing from you.
2149	Regards.
2149	Sara
2150	Susan: A few items to follow up with: (1) I understand that you are finalizing the Enron Corp. guaranty with Clement Abrams.
2150	Please let me know when all is agreed and I will arrange with Clem for an executed guaranty.
2150	(2) Stephanie Panus will fax to you the power of attorney for EEFT to act for ECTRIC.
2150	The acronyms will be obvious in the fax.
2150	(3) Euros are fine for Termination and Contractual Currency.
2150	(4) I am considering your proposed certificate in lieu of a board resolution and checking your tax rep.
2150	I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.
2150	You can contact Stephanie Panus in my absence.
2150	Regards.
2150	Sara
2151	I will be taking Friday, Dec. 29 as a vacation day.
2151	Sara P.S.
2151	I will also be on vacation Dec. 7 & 8.
2152	All: Enron's treasury group is reviewing some of the extremely high volume master swap agreements to see if rehypothecation of collateral is an alternative.
2152	The Bank of America ("BofA") agreement is an ISDA but the credit annex is our old format.
2152	BofA has agreed with Bill Bradford to replace the existing Annex A (Collateral and Exposure Provisions) with the ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13.
2152	Soma Ghosh is spearheading this effort and she may contact one of you to assist in this effort.
2152	I told Soma that credit would need to provide a credit worksheeet.
2152	Thanks.
2152	Sara
2153	Here is the latest margin rate change -
2154	I will be out of the office on Dec. 7 & 8.
2154	Please contact one of the paralegals for assistance.
2154	Thanks.
2154	Sara
2155	Please let me know if you did anything with this or I will assign.
2155	Since you were copied, I didn't know if you had a conversation with Tanya or Soma.
2155	Thanks.
2155	Sara
2156	Susan: Please let me know what happened with this.
2156	Thanks.
2156	Sara
2157	Chris: Please call me and let's discuss.
2157	My hesitancy comes from the big difference in the ISDA for general corporates and GOVERNMENTALS (which you know are treated differently).
2157	Sara
2158	John: I just received the Instinet amendment to place additional access at Enron House.
2158	The "Equipment" is described as follows: Please verify that this is what you need.
2158	I can have this signed immediately.
2158	Sara
2159	FYI
2160	Sheila: Is this a request to me?
2160	Sara
2161	Holli: I have a conference call with EWEB's lawyer at 9 am PST.
2161	I'll call you later.
2161	Sara
2162	Susan: The tax rep is fine.
2162	We are following up on the P/A, and Clement should respond re: the guaranty.
2162	Sara
2163	Justin: I am told by Theresa Brogan that Enron Networks requires an account with one of the prime brokers frequently used by ENA and other Enron Corp. subsidiaries and that you are handling this particular agreement.
2163	ENA has negotiated multiple accounts with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (collectively, "Morgan").
2163	We have an agreed form of Customer Agreement with Morgan which has been easy to duplicate for additional affiliates of ENA.
2163	Also, we screen all agreements through credit and risk control (since our resolutions for opening brokerage accounts require dual signatures from both the Enron affiliate and risk control).
2163	I don't know what your procedure is in London but let me know if we can be of any assistance.
2163	Theresa is holding the docs until I hear back from you.
2163	Thanks.
2163	Sara
2164	Stephanie: Do we control the drafting?
2165	John: Thanks for your message.
2165	I have asked Brent Hendry to give you a call.
2165	Hope you're doing well.
2165	Sara
2166	Please email John re: status.
2166	Thanks.
2166	Sara
2167	Tana: Here's the background info.
2167	Do you want to prepare the ISDA CSA?
2167	We will also need an amendment to replace the old with the new.
2167	I now need to reread Tanya's message.
2167	Sara
2168	Tanya: Both ENA (rate) and Enron Corp.(equity forwards) are seekig master agreements with MSCS.
2168	Rod prepared a credit worksheet for the ENA agreement in June, 2000 and I will fax a copy to you separately.
2168	(1) With respect to the ENA master, is the ENA credit worksheet still current or does it need to be changed?
2168	(2) With respect to the Enron Corp. master (which will not have a CSA or an Enron Corp. guaranty), what cap should we request from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.?
2168	Should it be $25MM as requested in the ENA document?
2168	Please let me know.
2169	Joe: Susan emailed the docs to Larry Johnson and John Porter on 11/30/00.
2170	Stephanie: Can we get the SITA blackline out today?
2170	We should put ENE guaranty in line for execution and let's push Clem for Friday at the latest.
2170	Also, Matt Dawson has requested copy of latest docs AND he cannot locate the executed P/A.
2170	I think you should try tax.
2170	Let me know if you need my help.
2170	Sara
2171	Matthew: Thanks for taking the time to chat this morning.
2171	I am looking for a copy of the EnronCredit.com Limited documents so that I can speak with credit in Houston and have draft docs for you as soon as possible.
2171	Please forward.
2171	Regards.
2171	Sara
2172	Further to my message of yesterday evening, I have spoken with the MSCS lawyer in London and learned that EnronCredit.com Limited ("ECCL") has finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.
2172	ECCL is awaiting the ENE guaranty.
2172	The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I understand they were heavily negotiated.
2172	Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?
2172	I would like to chat with whomever is handling today, if possible.
2172	I will forward ECCL to you both when I receive.
2172	Thanks.
2172	Sara
2173	John: Does this look alright for execution?
2173	Sara
2174	Tanya: I've been meaning to touch base with you about: In our form CSA, the Debt Rating Change is triggered ONLY off of S&P.
2174	I thought this was a carry-over from ENE's previous split rating.
2174	Does credit want to leave the trigger at "below BBB- by S&P" or also add in Moody's?
2174	Thanks.
2174	Sara
2175	Matt and Denis: I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.
2175	I requested a copy burt he has not yet sent it over.
2175	Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS and we would like to work from your document.
2175	Can you email me a copy?
2175	Thanks.
2175	Sara
2176	FYI until I get to it!
2177	go to :
2178	Holli: We need to talk about status.
2178	I spoke yesterday with three EWEB lawyers and Dick Varner.
2178	I have to comment back on the Schedule to the master agreement.
2178	EWEB has not yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed legal opinion.
2178	EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending resolution of the master agreement.
2178	Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given point in time.
2178	EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons (employed by governmental entities) are completely void.
2178	Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.
2178	However, you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.
2178	Before you ever trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past relationship with an EWEB trader.
2178	You will first have to conduct some due diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.
2178	ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.
2178	Let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further.
2178	Thanks.
2178	Sara
2179	I understand your concern but negotiating your future position is part of the agreement.
2180	Greg: I received the following email from RBC and am attaching a redline of changes.
2180	Since ECC will be signing, let me know if you have any objections.
2180	Sara
2181	FYI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2182	Tracy: Tanya handled this last go round.
2182	Sara
2183	Aaron: I spoke with both Matt Flett (Morgan counsel) and Denis O'Connell about the ISDA already negotiated by EnronCredit.com Limited.
2183	Each was supposed to send me the draft docs for me to review and comment on for ENA.
2183	I have not received anything yet but will comment immediately upon receipt.
2183	I'll keep you up to date.
2183	Sara
2184	Dana: What would be a convenient time for us to chat briefly about the legal issues associated with derivative transactions between ENA and municipal/governmental counterparties?
2184	Please let me know.
2184	Thanks.
2184	Sara
2185	All: To whom should Risk Management & Trading Corp. ("RMT") direct the swap confirmation related to RMT's hedge management fee with Enron Nordic Energy (Norwegian branch of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.)?
2185	The previous transaction was dated February 24, 1999 and requires amendment.
2185	Please let me know.
2185	Sara
2186	Tanya and Tana: I am attaching the following (see the Security Agreement Amendment) as an example of what we did in the Chase amendment of the CSA.
2186	Please note the use of longer dated government securities.
2186	I don't know what we want to use with BofA.
2186	Sara
2187	Jay: I'll wait to hear from you.
2187	Sara
2188	Laurel: Please call me and let's talk.
2188	SS
2189	Susan: This is an urgent matter for London.
2189	We need to have this guaranty executed quickly and I will call Clem to describe the issue.
2189	Please handle and follow up with me during the day.
2189	Sara
2190	Angela: Please let me know how you want to proceed.
2190	Thanks.
2190	Sara
2191	Blair: Attached below is a redline version of the consent which has been approved by Enron Canada Corp. Sara
2192	The correct address is:
2193	Martin and Orjan: Thank you for responding to my message.
2193	I still need to know WHO will EXECUTE the confirmation on behalf of Enron Nordic Energy (Norwegian Branch of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.? Clara is here in Houston and cannot sign for that entity. Please advise. Sara
2194	Denis: I spoke with Clem and forwarded the attached guaranty.
2194	I didn't read the guaranty so I don't know if it was negotiated or standard.
2194	You should contact Clem about the urgent nature of the request as I am not familiar with the details.
2194	Thanks.
2194	Sara
2195	Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market.
2195	In that regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds.
2195	Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have the "choice" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this option.
2195	LEGAL: When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13.
2195	CREDIT: When drafting credit worksheets, please be specific when requesting types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.
2195	We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.
2196	David: We are drafting a credit derivative confirmation in connection with one of our year-end deals.
2196	Will you or Jean be able to review the confirm with us?
2196	I look forward to hearing from you.
2196	Regards.
2196	Sara
2197	Brant: Please call me or schedule time to discuss Bridgeline ("CP").
2197	In particular, you should note the following: (1) CP requests cross default with US 100 million for ENA and US 20 million for itself.
2197	(2) Change in ownership as default trigger is different from your proposal.
2197	(3) CP requests US 15 million Enron Corp. guaranty and increases its guaranty cap to US 15 million (4) Docs to be delivered: ONLY CP's guarantor to deliver annual unaudited/quarterly unaudited consolidated financials (5) Review setoff (elimination of affiliates) (6) Review transfer because CP has a proposal for ENA (7) Change to collateral thresholds - bilateral US 15 million Also, I think Susan verified with you that you did not intend to use a non-specific MAC (even though the credit worksheet is marked as such).
2197	I'll wait to hear from you.
2197	Sara
2198	Janine: With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with: (1) RMT (as principal for Houston FX desk) (2) EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).
2198	In this regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to include RMT for internal trades?
2198	(3) Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk) There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.
2198	Thanks.
2198	Sara
2199	Marcelo: Thank you for your response.
2199	Yes, I am still interested in having the two questions (mentioned in my email to you) answered.
2199	We have several derivative transactions with Chilean parties and I would like to know of modifications to both the derivatives memorandum which you prepared for us in 1997 AND changes to our form of Schedule.
2199	Please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.
2199	Regards, Sara
2200	Stuart: I wanted you to be aware of the REASON for the holdup on your FX online product.
2200	We are trying to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.
2200	Sara
2201	Melissa: Were you working on this for Chris?
2201	SS
2202	Janine: Thanks for the update.
2202	Any word on the Japanese FX desk principal?
2202	Sara
2203	Blair: I sent this to you yesterday.
2203	Sara
2204	Matt: This is still outstanding and we may have to change Part 3 of the Schedule to reflect the change.
2204	DID YOU SPEAK WITH OUR FRENCH LAWYERS?
2204	Please let Stephanie know.
2204	Sara
2205	great!
2206	Mark: Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.
2206	Each of those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the economic terms of each deal.
2206	Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a "deemed" version of such an agreement or (3) "terms and conditions" appearing in the confirmation itself.
2206	It is quite likely that in any of these three types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or termination, etc. which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the Canadian company.
2206	Further, there may be credit issues associated with the transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).
2206	As a result, a party attempting to "step into the shoes of the Canadian company" must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with assuming those positions.
2206	Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading positions of the Canadian company.
2206	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2206	Sara
2207	Carson: Yes, Monty, Keith and I had a great lunch at Galatoire's last Friday.
2207	Monty had to leave early for a soccer game in Memphis (I think).
2207	Maybe we can get Donna to raid the X-mas wine in the cellar.
2207	Sara
2208	Susan: Thanks for the update.
2208	Gary Hickerson wants this product available on EOLnow (which explains why I am called daily by the trading desk).
2208	Do you knowhen a decision on the Japanese FX principal will be forthcoming?
2208	Sara To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Janine Juggins/LON/ECT@ECT, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT, William Stuart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Jacobellis/NA/Enron@Enron@ECT, Jeff Subject: Re: FX Product Sara, Attached are two e-mails that I sent yesterday and today on the Japanese FXtrader.
2208	In short, we are pursuing the dependent agency approach.
2208	The specifics are set forth in the e-mails.
2208	Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.
2208	Best regards, Susan
2209	Attached is our format
2210	I'll verify with Susan ASAP
2211	Melba: The product description requires the following change in part (iii) regarding the Enron principal: "...Enron Japan Corp. as agent for Risk Management & Trading Corp. ..."
2211	Please submit the revised description to me.
2211	Thanks.
2211	Sara
2212	Chris: Please call.
2212	The parties need to exchange documents and the boilerplate (which we are unable to send) requires execution.
2212	If you must trade today, we could exchange fax signatures and your counterparty can fax evidence of authority to enter into the master and transactions.
2212	In any event, we need to execute duplicate originals, one for each party.
2212	Sara
2213	Special Provisions for Confirmation of this Transaction: Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement, unless Counterparty executes this Confirmation and transmits the executed Confirmation to ENA via facsimile to the facsimile number hereinbelow provided prior to 5:00 p.m (CST) on December 15, 2000, this Confirmation and theTransaction evidenced herein shall be completely null and void and without force and effect.
2213	ENA's telephone and facsimile number for purpose of confirming Transaction: __________________________________
2214	Melba: This looks fine.
2214	Sara
2215	Thanks so much!
2215	Sara
2216	Sam: We need to send an execution package Fed Ex for Tuesday morning delivery.
2216	The file is in my office as I need to speak with these guys on Monday.
2216	Chris Foster is the Enron contact in Portland.
2216	Thanks.
2216	Sara
2217	John Suttle spoke with Jeffrey Pak.
2217	All is fine.
2217	Sara
2218	Kaye: the attached "Enron forward" document below needs to be compared against the "forward template" that you saved in my directory today (confirms/equity).
2218	I have an 11 a.m. meeting with Clint et al on Monday.
2218	I'd like to have the comparison before the meeting, if possible.
2218	Please let me know if this is possible.
2218	Sara
2219	Kaye: I would like to schedule a meeting after Christmas (Dec. 27 0r 28 if possible) with the following people; Samantha Boyd Stephanie Panus Cheryl Nelson Cassandra Schultz (X30429 - you'll need to call her assistant)
2220	Richard: Have you sent a letter?
2220	The first payment should be due (for the month of November, 2000, billed in early December, 2000).
2220	Sara
2221	Hey, Brant: We still have some of the same issues.
2221	Sara
2222	Susan: I need to review with Brant but here's your copy.
2222	Sara
2223	Phil: I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).
2223	Please let me hear from you.
2223	Regards, Sara
2224	Ed: Please respond to item (2) regarding EWEB.
2224	Thanks.
2224	Sara P.S.
2224	EWEB has not commented on the CSA.
2225	Holli: I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.
2225	I have also not received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.
2225	I will go ahead and blackline the Schedule once again.
2225	When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end of the year.
2225	Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?
2225	Thanks.
2225	Sara
2226	Holli: Please verify that the earliest TRADE DATE with EWEB was October 30, 2000 (which was approved by the EWEB Board on October 3, 2000 according to the December 5, 2000 resolution).
2226	I have a copy of the resolution.
2226	Thanks.
2226	Sara
2227	A second EWEB question: EWEB wants the definition of "Applicable Rate" to remain without changing to the Non-default Rate if the payee is the defaulting party.
2227	They say they must have a "balanced rate".
2227	Please let me hear from you.
2227	Sara
2228	We need to send today BUT we need an immediate cover letter (itemizing every step to be taken) and sample resolution format to email to the counterparty and lawyer.
2228	I'll review the letter.
2228	I have an 11 am meeting but should be back in an hour.
2228	Let me know if you have questions.
2228	Sara
2229	Maria: Can you provide me with a blackline of one of the confirms below marked against the draft which Enron marked up and faxed to Steve on September 1, 2000?
2229	The current format contains a number of changes and it would be easier to review.
2229	The directory on that document reads "Ext. ID[.]".
2229	We want to respond quickly, today being our goal.
2229	Thanks.
2229	Sara
2230	Per our discussion - Sara
2231	Beth Ann: Here's UBS's "redraft" which also requires review.
2231	Please call me in a few hours if I haven't contacted you.
2231	Thanks.
2231	Sara
2232	Phil: Why don't you execute (duplicate originals) and overnight to me?
2232	I'll return an original to you tomorrow (overnight), as well.
2232	I'm located, specifically, at: 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Please call if you need anything.
2232	Thanks.
2232	Sara
2233	FYI only - no response required Please advise if I'm copying you on too many "equity related" emails.
2233	Sara
2234	Chris: The master you are referring to was drafted in March, 1999 in the name of "Air Liquide America Corp."
2234	and needs to be updated from both a credit and legal perspective.
2234	Last time, Kelly Minear had to visit the counterparty's office to review financials since the company was private.
2234	We will need an updated credit worksheet to prepare a new draft.
2234	Tracy and Ed: Will one of you update the prior credit to begin the process?
2234	Thanks.
2234	Sara
2235	Sam: Don't you have a new address by now?
2235	I remember you said that you were moving into a plush high-rise overlooking the great southern city of Atlanta, home of the Peach Bowl!
2235	Please email me and let me know.
2235	A belated thanks for the birthday card.
2235	I had a fabulous birthday in Napa Valley at Auberge d'Soleil with my little sister and friends.
2235	We drank wonderful wines and dined in great restaurants - and had great weather.
2235	Hope you're doing well.
2235	Have you started any new business ventures?
2235	Maybe taken Wendy's to Amelia Island Plantation?
2235	Or better yet, purchased the water rights to Palm Springs?
2235	I'm just hangin' in Houston, same old job, etc. I joined my two friends Monty and Keith for our annual birthday celebration at Galatoire's about two weeks ago.
2235	It's always great fun.
2235	I think I get to plan a reunion of Gordon, Arata et al ex-pats.
2235	There are about thirty of us scattered around the country.
2235	My regards to Beverly and Helen.

2238	Please let me know ASAP.
2238	Thanks.
2238	Sara
2239	Jim: In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and "Reference Market - makers" in the Schedule (specifically Enron's request to delete clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.
2239	With respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which city has four leading dealers for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?
2239	Please let us know.
2239	Thanks.
2239	Sara
2240	Beth Ann: Here's the support sent by UBS.
2240	You may already have already reviewed.

2242	Marlene: I'll call Lesley with my comments.
2242	What is the second attachment called "Cancellable" relating to Captiva III Finance CBO?

2245	Jim is available in the am.
2245	Jim has not heard from CSFB.
2246	Trigger/Determined Amount inverse relationship: "In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger Price. The "Effective Share Price" shall be the result obtained by dividing X by Y where "X" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the Number of Shares, and "Y" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined Amount."
2246	Paragraph 3(a) first paragraph, 3rd sentence replacement: "In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled "Other Provisions," Party B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares. Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares by the Final Price]."
2247	FYI only
2248	Jim: I have not seen any Enron Corp./CSFB agreements.
2248	ENA has two different agreements with CSFB: (1) ISDA dated4/21/93.

2249	Jim: Can we get your small conference room?
2249	Sara

2250	Thanks for your help.
2250	Sara
2251	Jim: Attached is a revised Schedule.

2260	I have not received the CSA yet so we cannot do anytning on that front.

2261	Regards.
2261	Sara
2262	Beth Ann: I received your message and tried to speak with CSFB and Jim Armogida.
2262	In each instance, unfortunately, I had to leave voice mails.
2262	It was just about 2 hours ago that I told CSFB that we were done (having left the negotiation of Paragraph 10.1 to Jim)!
2262	I am forwarding the latest UBS comments to you just in case I have the urge to call you for advice.
2262	Have a Merry Christmas.
2262	I'm off to New Orleans this evening for the holiday weekend.

2269	here's the draft I resent to Bear.
2269	Sara
2270	Holli: Will you be on this call?
2270	Also, you never answered my question about reference market makers.
2270	Please call me early today.
2270	Thanks.
2270	Sara
2271	I have been called for Jury Duty on January 16, 2001.
2272	Sam: I accidentally deleted this CP from the list (when I was trying to delete CSFB from the ISDA section).
2272	You will need to reconstruct.
2272	I'm sorry.
2272	Sara
2273	Ken: Please let me hear from you as soon as possible today.
2273	I will not be in the office on Friday, Dec. 29.
2273	In connection with the blacklined confirmation which we discussed yesterday, please (1) verify that there are no changes (or if there are changes, we need to discuss) (2) provide Bear's information for Paragraph 8 (Offices) (3) advise if you wish for us to finalize the document or if you would prefer to do so We would like to exchange faxed signatures today, if at all possible.

2274	Maria is expecting your call.
2274	Sara
2275	Add some liquidity for me!
2275	Have a Happy New Year!
2275	Sara P.S.
2275	Who knows: you may run into Susan B.
2276	In connection with the two (2) swap confirmations which you are revising (from a "Deemed ISDA" format to a regular ISDA format), I ask that you please contact Stephanie to review the final forms.
2276	Please note the following: (1) Melissa's prior "Deemed ISDA" drafts (dated Nov. 22, 2000) show ENA swap nos.
2276	as 447459.4 and 447459.02.
2276	One of your confims doesn't match: it says 447459.04.
2276	Please verify the correct number.
2276	(2) You can eliminate the "Payment Date(s)" section from the General Terms because individual Payment Dates appear in both the Fixed and Floating Details.
2276	After either Tana or Stephanie have approved, please email to EWEB as follows (with a copy to Holli Krebs): NOTE TO STEPHANIE: copies of my markups and the Deemed ISDA's are located in a file entitled "EWEB confirmations".
2276	Also, the ISDA has not been signed but will be dated October 30, 2000.
2277	EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week.
2277	Your MAC references the "Electric System" which is defined in the Bond Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.
2277	It looks to me like the Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).
2277	I've asked Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.
2277	Please review the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first thing on Tuesday.
2277	Thanks.
2277	Sara Stephanie: Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done.
2278	Dick: Sorry that I didn't have a chance to call you again today.
2278	After reviewing the appendix (Board resolution summary), I would like to request an opinion from EWEB's bond counsel that swap/other transaction payments are payable from the Operating Fund (together and in parity with other operating costs) and precede EWEB's debt service payments.
2278	Also, can you please describe EWEB's Master Resolution (relevant to long term bonded indebtedness) as this is to be referenced in Larry Cable's legal opinion.
2278	I will be back in the office on Tuesday, Jan. 2.
2278	Have a happy new year.
2278	Thanks.
2278	Sara
2279	Stephanie: Happy New Year!
2279	I have assigned you to this former Marie Heard file.
2279	We need to overnight copies of the master agreement (boilerplate and all) to Neel Lemon in Dallas.
2279	He does not need ENA's or the CP's background documentation.
2279	You can send the ENE guaranty.
2279	This company has undergone a franchise tax restructuring and has survived as a limited partnership which we are in the process of evaluating.
2279	I'll bring the file to you.
2279	Details to follow soon.
2279	SS
2280	All: Following is a list of outsanding items: (1) ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule and Credit Support Annex) I need to better understand EWEB's proposed settlement language.
2280	ENA generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment (but not when ENA owes a payment).
2280	The invoice reflects the outstanding transactions for a given Calculation Period and the net amount owed.
2280	ENA can generate this invoice in all cases.
2280	Does EWEB intend that BOTH parties always send reciprocal invoices?
2280	Is is necessary that the Calc Agent ALSO make a phone call?
2280	What does EWEB's language "separate invoices and documentation covering each Transaction sufficient to permit the other party to comply with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning individual Transactions" mean?
2280	Please call me to resolve.
2280	When can we execute?
2280	(2) Cable Huston legal opinion: please add (1) opening paragraph: "(iii) the Confirmations for Transactions ENA Contracts Nos. 447459.02 and 447459.4 each dated October 30, 2000 ..."
2280	(2) Paragraph 12 prior to the period in the first sentence: "as those terms are defined in the Master Resolution adopted by the EWEB Board on June 16, 1986, as supplemented" (3) the two (2) confirmations These require execution by EWEB.
2280	When will this be done?
2280	(4) Bond Counsel opinion Dick, I sent you an email on Friday.
2280	ENA is pleased to discuss with your counsel.
2280	Please refer to Larry's legal opinion: the deleted Paragraph 10 of the December 21, 2000 draft and the Paragraph 12 of the December 30, 2000 draft for the type of information requested.
2280	Please let me know if I have left out any items.
2280	I would like to finalize documentation today.
2280	Regards.
2280	Sara
2281	LaureL: Please let me know where you end up (ENA, Enron Corp., ECT Investments) so that I can be clear in Lotus Notes and the files for future reference.
2281	Thanks.
2281	Sara
2282	We will overnight the agreement to you.
2282	Sara
2283	Dick: Please call me about the settlement issue.
2283	I spoke with Jim earlier and he deferred to you entirely.
2283	Thanks.
2283	Sara

2285	Cheryl: Can we meet for a few minutes after 9 am tomorrow?
2285	Sara
2286	Phil: Happy New Year!
2286	And back to old business.
2286	ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).
2286	I had previously left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.
2286	Please forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.
2286	Thanks.
2286	Sara
2287	Stephanie: I have reviewed the attachment and it is correct.
2287	We should attach and return one to Phil.
2287	We need one copy for the file, credit and Soma.
2287	I'm not sure who else might need but we can check with Soma.
2287	Sara
2288	Chris: I checked with Samantha.
2288	The counterparty is holding two orignal ISDA documents (complete with boilerplate and Schedule/CSA) and ENA resolutions (in the form of unanimous consents) and incumbency.
2288	Sam will check on the ENE guaranty.
2288	There is nothing more that we can do unless you want us to call the Please advise.
2288	Sara
2289	Angela: Unless Mary has addressed already or a different plan is in place, can you handle?
2289	Sara
2290	Jeff: In connection with the instructions given by London to Shane Dallmann, note that the instruction for ENA to transact the Euro hedges was given by Peter Russell.
2290	Please advise as to whether these should be RMT transactions and which Enron affiliate should be involved.
2290	Thanks.
2290	Sara
2291	Terry: Clint Freeland asked that we resend our forward confirmation template to you.
2291	It is attached below.
2291	Also, we will send a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule only, no boilerplate) to you shortly.
2291	Can you provide me with the name of your attorney so that we can email directly?
2291	It seems that Enron North America Corp. is currently negotiating an ISDA with First Union National Bank and sent a new ISDA draft to the attention of Delene Travella on 11/08/00.
2291	There may be an efficient way to handle both master agreements simultaneously.
2291	I look forward to hearing from you.
2291	Regards, Sara
2292	Clint: Will ENE be transacting with First Union National Bank or First Union Securities, Inc.?
2292	I need to know the correct legal entity.
2292	Sara
2293	Clint: ENA is in complete agreement with DB on its ISDA.
2293	Do you still want an ISDA for ENE?
2294	Per my voice mail.
2294	Sara
2295	Mara: Got your voice mail and wanted to let you know that Cheryl Nelson will be handling this file.
2295	Cheryl will give you a call.
2295	Sara ps Her phone number is 713-345-4693

2299	I am open any time on Jan. 8, 9 or 10.
2299	I'll email Jason once I hear from you.
2299	Thanks.
2299	Sara
2300	Dick: After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.
2300	I propose that we add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows: "Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to Party B. With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment instructions: [bank, account no., ABA no.]" Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any comments.
2300	I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.
2300	Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.
2300	Have these been sent to anyone at Enron?
2300	Sara
2301	Happy New Year Dan!
2301	Just checking to verify that you received the order form that I faxed to you on December 18.
2301	Please confirm.
2301	Also, we brought a bottle of Freestone Hill to Pappas Steak House (on New Year's Eve) for everyone to try.
2301	The sommeliers raved.
2301	Regards.
2301	Sara
2302	Stephanie: Below is forwarding info for both Lotus Notes and sending this ISDA.
2302	Sara
2303	FYI
2304	Tanya: Per my voice mail, is any type of corporate guaranty required from this counterparty?
2304	Does our Additional Event of Default require any changes?
2304	Sara
2305	Jason: Let's meet on Monday, Jan. 8 at 2 pm in my office.
2305	Sara
2306	Dick: Yes, please let me know who received the executed confirm (or you can fax me copies at 713-646-3490).
2306	We'll insert your bank info when we hear from you today and I'll Fed Exp execution copies this evening.
2306	Thanks so much for your help.
2306	Sara
2307	The Enron trading entity is "Enron North America Corp."
2308	Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.
2308	I cannot locate the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.
2308	The Enron party is ENA.
2308	We now need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.
2308	ENA's use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, corporates, JGB's.
2308	We need to: (1) remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader) (2) add the following: Darren Delage Shane Dallmann Ellen Su Gary Hickerson THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.
2309	You only need the "authorized user annex".
2310	Tom: I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.
2310	We have one issue: If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e. over 3 days), and we have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally obtain 2 quotes and average them.
2310	Our position is that we prefer to obtain the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.
2310	NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then average the 4 quotes.
2310	Are you agreeable to this?
2310	Sara
2311	Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master agreement.
2311	If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit provisions), Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of credit format.
2311	I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.
2311	Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .
2311	Thanks.
2311	Sara
2312	Kaye: I'm having trouble printing the attached.
2312	Thanks.
2313	Tana: Mike E. Kelly (mid market power) would like access to the database.
2313	Would you please request?
2313	Maybe some of the other power traders are interested.
2313	Thanks.
2313	Sara
2314	Vivian: I have not received the copy of our executed electronic trading agreement.
2314	Please let me know if there is a problem.
2314	Thanks.

2315	Per the voice and emails left for Gareth Bahlmann, you may direct ISDA documentation to my attention.
2315	Enron North America Corp. is the legal entity.
2315	You may use the address information below.
2315	Our ISDA template will provide notice information pursuant to Paragraph 12 of the multicurrency form.
2315	You may use me as a contact lawyer initially; the transaction lawyer should contact you shortly.
2316	To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone.
2316	All trades will be confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement reflecting trades done the previous day.
2316	ENA does not prepare a confirmation but will need to check out the broker statements.
2316	I believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form (in variable denominations) or as registered certificates (e.g., undivided interests in a mortgage pool).
2316	We will trade US agencies and Japanese bonds with Goldman.
2316	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2317	Ed: Mike Kelly wants to trade with the above counterparty.
2317	We have no master.
2317	How do you want to handle?
2317	Sara
2318	Mary: Please respond to Elliot.
2318	Thanks.
2318	Sara
2319	Actually, Bob was handling and he knows you will handle.
2319	I believe that this master was based upon the Cargill, Incorporated master.
2319	SS
2320	Attached is a discussion outline for our meeting tomorrow.
2320	Short of micromanagement, I tried to identify areas which might benefit from specific attorney oversight.
2321	Susan: Please prepare a draft ISDA for the above parties with: (1) no CSA and (2) bilateral cross-default at US$100 million.
2321	I am presently reviewing CP comments to the ENA master and may have some changes for you tomorrow.
2321	We will send this out on Tuesday.
2321	Clint: First Union Securities Inc. is the bank's marketing arm and is NOT the correct ISDA counterparty.
2322	I'd like to attend.
2323	Marcia: Mike Kelly asked that I send you a copy of our GTC's for financial trades which must be attached to all confirmations (in the absence of an executed ISDA Master Agreement).
2323	ENA has been using these GTC's for quite some time.
2323	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2323	Sara
2324	Russell: I just received a call from the lawyer for Florida Power & Light Company, the regulated utility.
2324	He told me that he was sending over ISDA documents for FPL Energy, the unregulated trading arm of the utility.
2324	Will you be handling credit on this one?
2324	Sara
2325	I'm not sure who is handling but we need to add Jorge as a signatory for ENA (Jorge is inHickerson's group).
2325	Let me know when this is completed and if you have any questions.
2325	Thanks.
2325	Sara
2326	Boy, he sure didn't waste any time!
2326	Let me know what we need to do.
2326	Sara
2327	And there's more!
2328	Call me about this one because Janelle needs to review carefully.
2328	Sara
2329	I'll handle.
2329	Thanks.
2330	Jeff: Do you have an answer yet?
2330	Sara
2331	Marcus: DTE Energy Trading has told us that they have executed emissions confirms with ENA.
2331	I am trying to review the GTCs that are sent out when these transactions are done.
2331	Can you please forward a copy?
2331	Thanks.
2331	Sara
2332	Thanks, Russell.
2332	That was precisely the answer I was looking for.
2332	SS
2333	Tanya: Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.
2333	A new total return equity swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.
2333	ENA must be the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion which must be issued for the structure.
2333	I would like to send Rabo our ISDA format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.
2333	I assume we do not want a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.
2333	Do we want cross default and Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?
2333	Do we want to add/eliminate additional events of default?
2333	The ultimate Schedule will probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format as much as possible.
2333	Please call me to update.
2333	This update is currently scheduled to close next Friday.
2333	Thanks.
2333	Sara
2334	Melissa: You may want to follow up with Amy.
2334	She should have received my comments last night.
2334	SS
2335	She forgot both of you!!!!!!!!!!!
2336	the attachment?
2337	Cheryl: I'll deliver to you.
2337	Sara
2338	Kaye: I need to revise this report and I will email changes for the ag section.
2338	SS
2339	Please let me review final.
2339	Thanks.
2339	SS
2340	Dear Mr. Rosenberg: I'm signed up with PayPal and you should have received confirmation.
2340	Please ignore shipping instructions accompanying PayPal because I had a problem trying to change the shipping address.
2340	The correct shipping address for the Pavia Federal Express is listed below (together with other information): I enjoyed speaking with you.
2340	Please let me know if you have any problems.
2340	I will put together a list soon.
2340	Regards.
2340	Sara
2341	FYI - I have a futures agreement for Gary which he needs now so I'll handle as I don't know if you are overwhelmed.
2341	We still need to talk sometime.
2341	SS
2342	Chris: There is a March 26, 1993 Master Commodity Price Swap Agreement between ERMS and Praxair, Inc. However, it is limited to natural gas price swap transactions.
2342	This is an extremely old, outdated form of agreement.
2342	Sara
2343	Tracy/Chris: We would replace the old ERMS agreement with an ISDA.
2343	Tracy: If you need a copy of the existing credit terms, please let me know.
2344	Cheryl/Sam: Please update Sheila.
2344	SS
2345	Kaye: Please remind Mike and me if I end up serving on a jury next week.
2345	SS
2346	I've left a message for Dave Adams (legal) to call back AND described to him the following situation: ENA and NRG have executed OVER 130 financial deals both online (EOL) and offline WITHOUT EVER CHANGING ANY OF THE GTC's.
2346	In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to change!
2346	The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.
2346	If you don't have an ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be viewed by a court as a single agreement.
2346	Having different versions of the GTC's does not look like a single agreement.
2346	I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.
2347	Carol: A rude awakening to the fact that you don't have a phone!
2347	Please stop by because I think you can help!
2347	Sara
2348	Jason: I received the A&K package the other day.
2348	Thanks very much.
2348	According to my list, you still have the following files: Dynegy Canada, Inc.* Weather Services International Wabash Valley Power Assoc.
2348	Moore Global Investments, Ltd. *Please prepare an exit memo to the file **Please call Brent Hendry to determine status Subject to your conversation with Brent, please return the remaining files to my attention.
2348	Please call me if you have any questions.
2348	Thanks.
2348	Sara
2349	Cheryl: Jason Peters is returning a partially negotiated agreement for a service which provides weather data (I think).
2349	When I receive it in the morning, I'll forward it to you for completion.
2349	The weather traders are calling about it.
2349	Sara
2350	Kevin: Please clarify for me: 2 quotes from Enron only or 2 quotes from Enron and 2 quotes from NYSEG Thanks.
2350	Sara
2351	Jane: Happy New Year back!
2351	Hope you are looking forward to a great 2001.
2351	After re-reading the string of emails, I am pleased to tell you that real help has arrived.
2351	We have just added three new lawyers to our group and Carol St. Clair has just returned from maternity leave.
2351	Carol will handle the credit insertion to the ISDA Schedule and you can correspond with her directly.
2351	Also, please let Carol have the info on our local counsel so that one of you can obtain a quick review of the credit portion.
2351	Thanks for being so patient.
2351	Regards.
2351	Sara
2352	Tanya: I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer "yes" or "no", etc. 1.
2352	Is First Union National Bank the correct name?
2352	(as opposed to First Union National Bank, Charlotte) 2.
2352	Threshold for cross default: We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 3.
2352	Documents to be delivered: FUNB will produce audited/consolidated financials for First Union Corporation.
2352	We requested FUNB financials.
2352	4.
2352	With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA): (i) FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and (ii) I sent you the FUNB matrix Is it acceptable?
2352	(iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include "Baa3 by Moody's" and "failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's".
2352	(iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of "Qualified Institution" to include not only the rating we assign, but also "having assets in excess of $10 billion" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party (v) FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made on a Valuation Date.
2352	I think we should retain language that demands can be made on or after a Valuation Date.
2352	But I think we could agree that demands be made prior to 5 pm New York time.
2352	5.
2352	With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of First Union National Bank): (i) FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we proposed) Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other with respect to ENE.
2352	Now you know why your assistance is always greatly appreciated.
2352	Sara
2353	Hey, Clem: Hope you had a great New Year!
2353	I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond "yes" or "no": (1) FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering "any other damages, costs and attorney's fees".
2353	Do you agree?
2353	(2) FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached.
2353	I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.
2353	Do you agree: (3) Guaranty to be governed by NY law.
2353	Agreed?
2353	I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.
2353	Thanks.
2353	Sara
2354	Ed: Please make sure that Susan knows the effective date of the assignment and that you are comfortable with having captured all outstanding trades as of that date.
2354	Thanks.
2354	Sara
2355	Have you heard from Amy?
2356	As a general proposition, I need to be advised of the activity on Gary's desk.
2356	Please let me know if you have responded to Sheila.
2356	I think the request is about two weeks old.
2356	Sara
2357	It may be the first email but I gave this to Sam at our legal/credit meeting last week.
2357	She was going to wait for the meeting with Cassandra for approval and signature (which was postponed).
2357	But we can't postpone responding to the request.
2357	Sara
2358	Tanya: I'd like to send our Schedule to Rabobank today since we will be off Monday, Jan. 15 and I have been called for jury duty on Tuesday, Jan. 16.
2358	I will ask Angela Davis (a finance lawyer with swap experience who is helping us out on the structured deals) to handle this for me.
2358	I don't want to deal with Rabobank's form of Schedule as a basis for discussion and I am told that this deal closes Friday, Jan. 19..
2358	A voice mail would be greatly appreciated.
2358	Thanks.
2358	Sara
2359	Just a reminder that I go on Tuesday, Jan. 16, and hopefully, return on Jan.

2360	Sara

2362	Susan: Per Tanya's message below, please prepare a draft Schedule for the bank listed below.
2362	There is no CSA.
2362	Angela can help you with the choices.
2362	THIS IS A DEAL SPECIFIC ISDA SCHEDULE and not for general use.
2362	Angela: I know that this Schedule will never be accepted in total but it highlights the ENA priorities.
2362	You can forward to the Rabobank person who sent the email request the other day and David Barbour et al.
2362	I would appreciate if you could handle and I'll let you know when I'm back in the office for good.
2362	Thank you both.
2362	Sara

2364	Mark: Per my vm, here's one request (since I'll be out Tuesday morning)

2366	Please let me hear from you.
2366	We need to make certain that these transactions are properly booked.
2366	Thanks.
2366	Sara
2367	We are having some issues with NRG regarding financial confirmations.
2367	We have executed over 100 financial deals without problems but a recently hired attorney has begun paying attention to the docs.
2367	THE EASIEST WAY TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION IS TO PUT AN ISDA IN PLACE.
2367	Could you please prepare credit as soon as possible.
2367	The Schedule/CSA should be sent to david.adams@enrgenergy.com.
2367	Thanks.
2367	Sara
2368	I didn't know if this was duplication.
2368	Sara

2387	Sara
2388	Taffy: Can you please send copies of ALL THREE sets of ISDA definitions to Bill Bowes?
2388	Thanks.
2388	Sara
2389	Hi, Dee: A few pieces of information from credit.
2389	1.
2389	With respect to ENA's swap counterparty, we note that the rated entity per S&P is "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".
2389	You need to let us know which entity is in fact the swap party.
2389	2.
2389	Regarding Threshold for cross default, $100,000,000 is fine.
2389	3.
2389	Regarding financials, if you want to provide us with First Union Corp. financials, we will need a guaranty and credit will switch to the guarantor.
2389	4.
2389	10 year bonds are OK with a haircut (probably 90 or 95%).
2389	5.
2389	Credit is still reviewing the matrix 6.
2389	Your changes to the MAC trigger are fine.
2389	7.
2389	Your comments to our definition of "Qualified Institution" have been rejected.
2389	8.
2389	The $30,000,000 cap on the Enron Corp. guaranty is fine.
2389	I'll try to follow up with you tomorrow.
2389	Sara
2390	Ed: As I mentioned to you, CP want to utilize as much of the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA as possible.
2390	Cargill, Incorporated was hightly negotiated and does not provide for affiliate setoff.

2390	Please let me know so that we can send the amended master to CP.
2390	Thanks.
2390	Sara
2391	Sam: Would you please verify for me that Lotus Notes is accurate (i.e., the information is correct) with respect to Repo agreements and that we can locate all files.

2392	Sara
2393	Let's go for definitely Friday!
2394	Jason: Here's my suggestion for item (ix) [Additional Event of Default] event on page 2 of the Schedule: "In the case of Party B, Enron North America Corp. .... owns less than a majority interest in Party B unless within five (5) Local Business Days of such occurrence, Party B posts collateral with Party A (i) in an amount equal to Party A's Exposure under this Agreement plus $250,000, but in no event greater than 125% of Party A's Exposure, and (ii) in a form satisfactory to Party A in Party A's reasonable discretion. "Exposure" shall mean for any relevant date for which Exposure is calculated, the amount, if any, that would be payable to Party A by Party B pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) of this Agreement as if all Transactions were being terminated as of the relevant date; provided that Market Quotation will be determined by Party A using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that would be paid for Replacement Transactions (as that term is defined in the definition of "Market quotation") in order to ensure that Party A does not suffer an economic penalty."
2394	I think that we agreed on everything else.
2394	Please send new blackline.
2394	Thanks.
2394	Sara
2395	I'm hanging out but Mark is sick with a virus and we don't know when he'lllshow up.

2398	Sara
2399	Tana: When will this be executed?
2399	(Lotus Notes indicates not yet) Enron Corp. needs an ISDA Agreement and I want to assign this to a paralegal.
2399	Thanks.
2399	Sara
2400	ENA has an ISDA master agreement with an affiliate of CSFB (but not CSFB).

2400	Sara

2403	Tanya: Enron Corp. has a 1/17/92 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange master wtih Paribas.
2403	I will fax to you the letter which I received regarding the above merger.
2403	Basically, Enron Corp.'s signature to this letter will indicate agreement to put all [existing, if any, and future] Transactions under this master but with all obligations becoming those of the surviving entity which is BNP and which changed its name to "BNP Paribas."
2403	Do you have any credit issues?
2403	Sara
2404	Mary Nell: Congrats on the promotion!
2404	I know that it is well deserved and couldn't have happened to a more qualified person.
2404	Look forward to seeing you soon.
2404	Sara
2405	Paul: This was the only "hedge fund" related item that I could find.
2405	I think that I may be the lucky recipient of Moore Global Investments.
2405	SS
2406	Tana: Other than your email attached, have you had other discussions with Mark or credit about hedge funds?
2406	Sara
2407	Tanya: I believe that CSFB International is located in the UK.
2407	Can you please verify and indicate if it is a "financial institution".
2407	Thanks.
2407	Sara
2408	Bob: Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to form changes.
2408	If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to "Negotiated Fallback" (to Section Also, the term "Relevant Price" is used in the "Negotiated Fallback" definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the Schedule when using "Negotiated Fallback" or whether we intend that "Fallback Reference Dealers" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the 4th fallback in our Schedule).
2409	I spoke with Ed and we should use ENA's standard setoff language.
2409	Please let me review your draft today before you email.
2409	Sara
2410	Kim: I hope Portland was successful.
2410	I'd like to go ahead and schedule two lunch sessions with the confirm/settlements group: the first regarding basic financial agreements/confirmations and format, lingo, etc (very general) and the second more specific session addressing types of financial transactions and their basic structures.
2410	One day next week would be great and perhaps one or two weeks after the first session for the followup.
2410	Please send your dates and list of attendees.
2410	Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
2410	Thanks.
2410	Sara
2411	Terry: How about Thursday, January 25 at 2 pm Houston time?
2411	Please verify.
2411	Thanks.
2411	Sara
2412	Ed: I subsequently learned that you had previously prepared credit.
2412	Please ignore my voice mail.
2412	Sara
2413	Sam: Have you discussed the comments with Ed or Tana?
2413	We should try to respond to counterparty comments if possible.
2413	Sara
2414	Clint: This call will be to discuss the confirm.
2414	We'll meet in my office.
2414	I'm still waiting for Terry to confirm.
2414	SS
2415	Mary: one quick note - I have a "blue file" pilot checkout process ready and I was going to email our group to implement.
2415	Let me know if you need to talk beforehand.
2415	SS
2416	No - who was the paralegal?
2417	Chris: Long time no see!
2417	Congratulations on your promotion.
2417	Hope all is going well.
2417	Sara
2418	Eric: I spoke too fast.
2418	I don't have a "sample" Annex B-1 (Collateral and Exposure Provisions) but will send the customized version this evening.
2418	Sara
2419	Ed: For purposes of this "omnibus" Transaction, Con Ed requests cross-default to ENA's guarantor and elimination of setoff for the non-defaulting party's affiliates.
2419	Samantha needs a worksheet for the Transaction before she can prepare Annex B and B-1.
2419	We're sending tonight together with the ISDA Schedule and CSA.
2419	Sam: We need to use the same carve-out for setoff in Annex B-1 as in the Schedule.

2420	We need to send the ISDA Schedule and CSA and Annex B and B-1 to the following people: Ed Sacks Janelle Scheuer Tom May
2421	FYI
2422	Another addressee -
2423	Carol: Attached is a sample questionnaire.
2424	Terry: Please verify that the call tomorrow works for you.
2424	If so, I can call you at whatever phone number you designate.
2424	Thanks.
2424	Sara
2425	Janelle and Tom: Ed Sacks and I need to speak with you in the a.m. about a few issues.
2425	I have questions about market disruption because Con Ed has asked: (1) that Market Quotation apply rather than Loss (in the event of Early Termination) Is this a very liquid market?
2425	ENA agrees to market quotation only for FX and short term deals in liquid markets (e.g., gas) (2) to jointly determine when a Market Disruption has occurred (after consultation) Usually ENA as the Calculation Agent makes this determination in good faith.
2425	(3) to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining the daily MTM Each party typically assesses its own MTM for valuation purposes (whether for collateral calls or termination, etc.).
2425	Sounds like Ed and I need to know what was said to Con Ed about marking (4) I think Con Ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each provide dealer quotes (rather than ENA coming up with two quotes in good faith) as a Disruption Fallback.
2425	Tom, I think we discussed this in a different situation.
2425	Ed and I agreed to conference at 10 am Houston time to discuss these and the draft docs (which were e-mailed to you).
2426	Shari: It looks like Bob worked on the company above.
2426	It it affiliated with Consolidated Energy Company of New York, Inc. and Con Edison Energy Solutions, Inc?
2427	Kaye: 10 am is good.
2427	Would you please invite the paralegals and lawyers in the swap group "to please plan to attend a meeting to discuss and learn about Confirmations and Transactions" at 10 am tomorrow, etc.
2428	Janelle and Ed: I have received two voice mails from Con Ed inquiring about resolution of the outstanding issues (I left each of you voice mails about these).
2428	I'm not revising any documents until I hear back from you.
2428	Janelle: Please let me know if I need to take any further action.
2428	Thanks.
2429	FYI
2430	Susan: Did you ever receive this from Paul?
2430	If not, you should please call him.
2430	Sara
2431	FYI
2432	Paul: Could you please resend the hedge fund email?
2432	Thanks.
2432	Sara
2433	Per: I am told that Mark Taylor sent an email in December to Bob Shultz at EOL addressing the hedge fund issues (and CTA issues) associated with online trading and that you and Caroline received that email.
2433	Apparently the hedge fund crises of last year have heightened regulatory scrutiny of the funds' derivatives activity.
2433	EOL does not want to be subjected to any regulatory oversight.
2433	I have not seen the email yet.
2433	I will broach the subject with Mark when he returns to the office.
2434	Scroll down for the Mark Taylor explanation
2435	In an effort to avoid loss of our executed agreements/files (master agreements, brokerage and futures agreements, repo agreements), we are testing out the "library approach" and instituting a checkout procedure.
2435	Whenever you remove one of these files from the file cabinet, please "hold the file location" with a signed "card" (legal sized) available on top of the master agreement file cabinet.
2435	You will also see a large sign reminding you to sign out for your file.
2435	When the file is returned, just replace the "card" with the file and delete your name from the "card".
2435	Please be sure to check out all files currently in your office.
2435	Thanks for your cooperation.
2436	10 am Houston time?
2437	Mark and Mark: Per is continuing to pursue hedge funds offline and called me yesterday about EOL hedge fund trading.
2437	Credit referred me to Mark's earlier message addressing the issues.
2437	As you can see, Per will want to meet next week to discuss.
2438	Melissa: You can insert into confirm as well as our account into.
2438	Sara
2439	after "Payment Date(s)": Payments: For each Determination Period, on the applicable Payment Date with respect to this Transaction, a net amount owed for each of Part 1 and Part 2 hereinbelow will be determined pursuant to Section 2(a) of Annex A attached hereto, and those two payments shall be payable on the applicable Payment Date
2440	FYI - and if you can't review this one before you leave today, drop off in my office.
2440	Thanks.
2440	Sara
2441	Melba: This looks fine.
2441	Sara P.S.
2441	Are there other financial powere products with a 10 Business Day payment period?
2442	Mr. Swanston: The changes are fine.
2442	Please prepare execution copies and forward for signature.
2442	Let me know if you have any questions.
2442	Sara
2443	Jeff: I have a copy of an "equity swap" between ENE and JEDI SPV I, LLC dated April 20, 2000 which wants to be a "forward", and which terminates on Sept. 11, 2000.
2443	The transaction is for 12,012,804 shares and a Notional USD Can you send me a copy of the JEDI LP "forward" which appears on Jill's list?
2443	Is it meant to be the confirm above?
2443	Sara
2444	we can email this doc and the comparison (i.e., her markup and the above doc) to Sylvia Dooley.
2444	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2444	Sara
2445	Sylvia: Shortly Samantha Boyd will email to you two documents: Enron North America Corp.'s final form of guaranty with most of your requested changes (the "ENA Guaranty") and a comparison of your guaranty markup against the ENA Guaranty.
2445	I am hopeful that this will be satisfactory for purposes of the deal at hand.
2445	Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
2445	Thanks.
2445	Sara
2446	Just checking to see if you had wrapped this up or if I needed to do anything further.
2446	Sara
2447	Ed: CA has responded with the following comments: (1) Additional Event of Default - CA will accept if minimum ratings are set at BBB- or Baa3.
2447	(2) Financials - no Cargill entities provide quarterly financials as a matter of practice.
2447	(3) Setoff - will not agree to our usual affiliate setoff language but will agree to setoff under the ISDA or other agreements.
2447	CA has not accepted our cross default threshold language or guaranty pending a determination from their credit group.
2447	Please let me know your response.
2447	Thanks.
2447	SS
2448	Jason: I had only a few comments (attached).
2448	Also, thanks for your help on Moore Capital.
2449	Rose: Please email to me the latest draft of the ISDA Schedule/Paragraph 13 so that we can comment.
2449	Also, information about your outside Bahamian counsel would be appreciated.
2449	Thanks.
2450	Jason: Regarding the above party, ENA submitted arbitration and the response was to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of NY courts and waive jury trial.
2450	You have this highlighted in yellow and flagged the jury trial waiver.
2450	Can you recall if you spoke with Richard about this issue?
2451	Hey, Stewart: It looks like Tana has been corresponding with these guys about EOL trading.
2451	Modesto was planning to address the ISDA after working with Tana on the electronic trading agreement.
2451	By copy of this message, Tana should let you know if anything recent has happened on the ISDA front.
2451	Let me know if you need anything further.
2451	Regards.
2451	SS
2452	wTechnologies conf.
2452	agreement Please see the message from Lewis Swanston below and call if you have any questions.
2452	Sara
2453	Jack: I was rushing and sent you my business address.
2453	Please enter my 2-year subscription to Art On Paper and send to my residence at: Sara Shackleton 3915 Coleridge Houston, Texas 77005
2454	Clem: Per my voice mail, please respond to the remaining issues raised by ConEd's lawyer: (1) "Guarantor agrees that its obligations are unconditional and will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the Contract, [without setoff of the amount payable under the Contract] irrespective of any claims as to the Contract's validity, regularity or enforceability or the lack of authority of Enron to execute or deliver the Contract, or any change or amendment to the Contract (whether or not approved by or known to Guarantor).' Response: the bracketed language is unacceptable. What about the bolded language? (2) "This Guaranty shall continue to be effective if the Guarantor merges or consolidates with or into another entity, loses its separate legal identity or ceases to exist."
2454	Response: not sure if this will remain effective if a merger occurs and therefore not binding (e.g., merger without assumption) (3) What are you looking for when requiring an "explanation of why such payment is due" in the demand section (paragraph 2)? Is it to identify the type of default suffered by ENA? Thanks for your response and I'll let you know if this particular guaranty is still a rush. SS
2455	Janelle: I reviewed the email of 1/19/01 from Ben Chu.
2455	There are only 2 items listed: (1) I will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ENA can select the price only if it hears from ConEd first.
2455	(2) I am not sure that I agree about the NY ISO changing pricing after 30 days.
2455	We will need to discuss.
2455	I have heard that this is not as frequent an occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the ISDA procedure for change in prices.
2455	(3) Other than the foregoing, he had no other comments exept to say that he would review again.
2456	A few items to consider for the paralegals: (1) We need to organize the various country opinions (ISDA closeout netting, ENA jurisdictional survey, others) so that they are accessible to the group.
2456	We should also have a checkout process for the opinions.
2456	We should have access to the ECTRIC opinion database (which I believe is organized online).
2456	I know that I can look in a particular file cabinet located near Susan for the various volumes of opinions, but where can I find an updated listing of all of the above?
2456	(2) Impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into Lotus Notes (for ALL types of agreements).
2456	(3) I believe that Sam is in charge of the unanimous consents (for all Enron affiliates).
2456	I for one would like an UPDATED book of the consents (kept updated).
2456	These consents must be maintained and kept current.
2456	If Sam is out of the office, we need access to the book.
2456	(4) We should create a "paralegal manual" as we go.
2456	Each person could be responsible for drafting sections (and you could review their drafting skills!).
2456	Given some time, I could probably help to identify relevant sections.
2456	(5) Agreement checkout.
2456	We need to create a "checkout card" for each file so that when files are returned to the file cabinet, the checkout card is retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout.
2456	I will volunteer my assistant to help out but I don't want to step out of turn here so I'll wait to hear from you.
2456	(6) I have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding ISDA's (mainly the Top Ten and high priority items).
2456	I'll send additional items as they occur to me.
2456	Thanks.
2456	Sara
2457	Cheryl: I just finished a conversation with Mara Alexander re: Cargill-Alliant, LLC.
2457	She was inquiring whether we could add the weather rep (for the Trade Option Exemption) to that amendment since it was not included in the Master Agreement between ENA and Cargill, Incorporated.
2457	I have not actually reviewed that master but if she is right, we should not have a problem complying with the request.
2457	SS
2458	Rose: You were going to provide with essentials regarding your Bahamian counsel.
2458	Please forward information.
2458	Thanks.
2459	FYI - our phone call
2460	FYI - our phone call
2461	Susan: would you please respond to this trader?
2461	thanks.
2462	Ed: Let me know what you think about the setoff (it excludes three Termination Events: Illegality, Tax Event and Tax Event Upon Merger) and I'll reinsert our part (b) setoff paragraph addressing the NDP's satifaction that other payments by the DP have been made.
2462	Sara
2463	Laurel: Just checking to see if we needed to meet.
2463	Sara
2464	Why is EPMI the Enron party for a financial trade?
2464	It should always be ENA.
2465	Annex B comments fine except we need your website address for purposes of Paragraph 4.
2465	Please note that: Par.
2465	3 Credit Support Agreements - Guaranty this assumes that we have the signed guaranty on the date of the Confirmation The Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of ConEd was submitted to our Treasury group this morning for signature.
2465	As of 5:30 p.m., it had not been returned to me.
2465	I have left a message with Treasury and hope that I will receive in the morning.
2465	Please advise (1) fax number of person to whom I should fax guaranty upon my receipt and (2) person/address for FedExp delivery of executed guaranty.
2465	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2466	Mary: per my voice mail.
2466	SS
2467	Mary: I'll meet with you tomorrow.
2467	I think that Carol will be your backup on this transaction.
2467	Sara
2468	Paul: John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the draft which we delivered in November, 2000.
2468	The credit issues are: (1) CP financials available online - we'll need their website address (2) CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a "higher number" but have not given John any indication of what they want Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare executable docs.
2468	Thanks.
2468	P.S.
2468	The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.
2468	CP doesn't care but needs confirmation and possibly explanation.
2469	Lucky you!!!!!!!!!!
2470	Ed: Without knowing what's being hedged, it could be either ENA or ECTRIC.
2470	Do you have more infor?
2470	Also, if the Enron party is ECTRIC, will Rod handle?
2470	Please let me know and I'll chat with Mara.
2470	Sara
2471	FYI We only have four "Top Tens" left after our meeting on Tuesday: Aquila Canada Corp. (BR) Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (BR) Gas Natural Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
2471	(PR) Sprague Energy Corp. (RD) Do you need legal to focus on others?
2472	Tracy: We can't move any further with Southern California Water Company (for derivatives trading) as they believe that the company requires CA PUC approval.
2472	Does legal need to actively pursue this party for financial trading?
2472	Hope you're surviving!
2473	Sam: I think you were going to speak with me about this one -
2474	Hi!
2474	There are only FOUR Top Tens and none are mine.
2474	I've asked credit to update the list.
2474	I am sending you all paper and pulp inquiries (just spoke with a new guy named John Fortunato).
2474	Why don't we talk Monday morning?
2475	Rod: Will you please read the email attached below from Cargill and let me know the proper Enron party?
2475	Ed has punted this one to you.
2475	Thanks.
2475	And, I hope things are going well.
2475	I know you'll miss rodeo time here in the Bayou City.
2475	I just received an invitation (courtesy of Enron) to the BBQ cookoff at the Reliant Astrodome Park (you know, the dome).
2475	I'll bet your mouth is watering.
2476	John: Please have Caraustar call Paul Radous about the cross default issue.
2476	Legal will wait to hear back from Paul after his discussion with your counterparty.
2477	Clem: I know that you sent Sheila Glover a form of ENE guaranty a few weeks ago.
2477	Sheila forwarded it to Bear and we received Bear's form which is unacceptable.
2477	However, if ENE has outstanding guaranties in favor of Bear, I would need to know since we may be able to use a previously negotiated form.
2477	Can you let me know if ENE has ever issued such a guaranty?
2477	Thanks.
2477	SS
2478	Thanks for the reminder!
2478	Would you please verify with Sheila Glover that Tuesday works for her and how many people will be attending?
2478	Then, we need to add Sam, Stephanie, Cheryl and me.
2478	SS
2479	Jason: Looks fine.
2479	Sara
2480	Sam: Please put entry into Lotus Notes and take off of legal/credit list.
2480	Thanks.
2480	SS
2481	Melissa: Please refer to Janelle's request for a draft confirm.
2481	The counterparty's draft has a floating price reference and you should verify with Janelle.
2481	Use the ISDA format; the counterparty is the "Power Authority for the State of New York".
2481	Ignore the "junk" in the counterparty's form.
2481	I have no other info about the particular deal.
2481	Call if you have any questions and please send me a copy.
2481	SS
2482	CSFB International
2483	Janelle: I discussed this earlier with Michael Brown.
2483	We've never heard from Con Ed re: the message I sent last night (attached).
2483	Samantha has the executed guaranty in hand.
2483	Please advise.
2484	Sam: Please fax the guaranty to Michael Forte at both fax numbers: Fed Ex the original as set forth below in Janelle's message.
2484	Revise Annex B/B-1 per my email of last evening and find web address below.
2484	Thanks for all of your help.
2484	Janelle will most likely execute a trade Monday morning.
2485	Janelle is set to do the Con Ed trade and will probably execute Monday.
2485	Samantha is revising the AnnexB/B-1.
2485	Let me know if you have any questions.
2485	Sara
2486	no
2487	Mary: Melissa Murphy (financial power) will be in Calgary next week (Tues - Fri) assisting the confirm desk.
2487	I thought it would be helpful if you and I scheduled a short meeting with Melissa on Monday to discuss desk issues.
2487	What is your schedule like on Monday?
2487	Thanks.
2487	Sara
2488	Bob: I spoke with John on Friday and you can revise this master per Paul's email.
2488	SS
2489	Sam: Please let me know when you can review the repo situation.
2489	Gary is asking for more repos.
2489	SS
2490	FYI
2491	We have a highly negotiated Annex B and B-1 which Samantha has just revised.
2491	She will send it to you.
2491	It is not to be used ever again (unless we agree once again).
2491	I can't remember where we left off on the confirm format.
2492	I second your resonse!
2493	I would like to take Friday, March 9 as a vacation day.
2494	Frank: Attached is the TVA form of Schedule for you to do your "ISDA comparison".
2494	SS
2495	I am not available at lunchtime on 2/13/01.
2496	All: Do you need any of the ISDA "boilerplate" language ( the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex) to attach to the draft Schedules/Paragraph 13 which we prepare to send to our counterparties?
2496	We do not have the "boilerplate" in a word document.
2496	Also, is there anything that Houston legal can do to facilitate your transactions?
2497	after 2 pm
2498	Dana: Mark Taylor asked that I look into this for you.
2498	Please give me a call and/or send me an email.
2498	Thanks.
2499	It's official!
2499	Rod Nelson has been promoted to Director.
2500	But you have to keep reading to get the entire message which is: I'm so pleased to hear of your promotion, and, how well deserved.
2500	We'll have to celebrate one day.
2501	Mary: I can't remember if I mentioned this, but we do need to track the Global Finance deals, whether through Lotus Notes or some other method.
2502	Stephanie: has this Enron Corp. ISDA master gone out?
2503	no
2504	Carol: Here's another paper & pulp master with a relatively new deal person (Steve Klein).
2504	The file has sat for ages and it looks like outside counsel has some time (he's a good guy).
2504	Please let me know.
2504	Also, I spoke with Mark and I'd like to sit down with you to do some brainstorming/planning, e.g., a group offsite, in-house training, form changes.
2504	Today is not a good day but tomorrow is fine.
2504	How about 2 pm?
2505	Stephanie: Here's the contact info.
2505	I don't think that this guy is a lawyer but I could be mistakem.
2505	Mention in the email that the draft was requested by Clint Freeland with Enron Corp. and to let us know who will be negotiating for CSFB.
2505	Thanks.
2506	I just got dragged into a lunch meeting tomorrow (re: Whitewing ) so I have to bag lunch.
2506	Will Friday work?
2506	Maybe you want to go to the meeting!
2507	I will attend from ENA legal (swaps).
2508	My apologies for the late response.
2508	Carol St. Clair will be handling Corrugated and she will call or email you to schedule a call.
2508	Carol can be reached at 713-853-3989.
2508	Thanks.
2509	Sharon: I'm on my way out of the office for an appointment but will be back around 4 or 4:30 Houston time.
2509	I'd like a quick chat this evening or tomorrow morning (before 11 am Houston, if possible).
2509	I understand that the dynamics of this deal were discussed by Russ and Jeff Kinneman/Sheila Glover.
2509	The Enron party is Enron North America Corp. ("ENA", formerly named "ECT") and the $25million Enron Corp. guaranty is for the purpose of securing payment of the 20%plus margin requirement for illiquid securities held by ENA in its Bear account ("stock loan account").
2509	I'm not sure if other agreements are necessary and I was hoping that we could discuss.
2509	Feel free to email or call.
2509	Thanks for your help.
2510	Please reflect in Lotus Notes and follow up.
2510	SS
2511	Either works for me right now.
2512	Mr. DDDDDDDDDDDDerivative: When do you want to move this guaranty along?
2513	Please schedule 30 minutes with Laurel to discuss her email to me re: web based confirms.
2514	I am reviewing comments from our Tuesday meeting.
2514	Do you want to follow up with Koch?
2514	Or do you want legal to pursue?
2514	A draft was sent out on 01/08/01and we have not heard back.
2515	I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer: ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.
2515	Guess what they want?
2515	The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and PHYSICAL): (1) Amerada Hess Corp. and ENA (2) Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and ENA (3) Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC and ELFI (4) Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC and ECT Singapore Pte.
2515	Ltd. (5) Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC and ECTRIC I explained our financial trading entities.
2515	She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
2515	Hess CREDIT: Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979 Hess LEGAL: Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133 Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the lawyer).
2515	TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
2515	As usual, thanks for your help.
2516	How about 9 am Houston (10 am New York)?
2516	Why don't you call me?
2516	It might be helpful for Scott to be available (we could conference him in if necessary).
2516	Let me know if this works.
2516	SS
2517	David: In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error.
2517	I believe that a guarantor can be a "corporation,....entity" having total asssts exceeding $10million.
2517	However, that subpart (I) guarantor cannot be one that falls into the subpart (III) category (which is different from the prior law).
2518	NY law is fine.
2519	Joe: A few questions: 1.
2519	Who trades this?
2519	2.
2519	What book does it sit in?
2519	3.
2519	What legal entity is that book?
2519	Please let me know as we are comparing this to another product.
2519	Thanks.
2520	Mary: I received a link several years ago to a European database.
2520	I don't know how to send it to you.
2520	It contains opinions, etc. Either Justin doesn't know if its existence or London never uses it!
2521	Stephanie: Bear's lawyer needs a copy of ENA's certificate of name change (from "Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.").
2521	The info you need is: Sharon Chernick phone: 212-272-2557 fax: 212-272-2727 email: schernick@bear.com
2522	Where is this being held?
2522	Still at 11?
2523	Please confirm that Lotus Notes is accurate (for repo agreements) by Wednesday, February 14.
2523	Please make necessary changes to the database and identify missing agreements.
2523	Thank you.
2524	Mark: What lawyer should review the securities filing (and other securities issues) for Gary's group?
2524	Is it Alan or a different lawyer?
2525	Anna: Attached is the form of Enron corp.
2525	guaranty.
2526	Please update the CSFB/Enron Corp. entry on Lotus Notes with status info (change from "legal review" to "draft sent") and names, phone nos., email addresses.
2526	The data will be accessible to anyone.
2527	Clem: Attached to the end of this string of emails is the Bear, Stearns & Co. ("Bear") form of guaranty.
2527	My only issue is with Section 1.
2527	Consents, Waivers and Renewals of the Bear guaranty which Bear insists upon .
2527	Although Bear will agree to the Enron form of guaranty, our Par.
2527	4 Setoffs and Counterclaims problematic in light of Bear's waiver provision.
2527	I'd like to discuss with you.
2527	ENA has agreed to a Securities Lending arrangement with Bear and the ENE guaranty (capped at $25million and restricted to ENA's arrangements with Bear) is part of that "package".
2527	FYI, several Enron companies have accounts with Bear.
2527	When do you think we could discuss?
2528	Steve: I know that Tana has already answered your immediate question.
2528	I am responding because Enron Corp. is also asking for an ISDA.
2528	I am the Enron Corp. lawyer.
2528	Can you also send a draft master to me?
2528	Thanks.
2528	Sara
2529	Cheryl: Have you responded to Aneela yet?
2529	Have drafts alreay been sent?
2529	I'd like to make sure that our internal process has been implemented so that we can address Gary's workload on a timely basis.
2529	If we need to meet, please let me know and I'll have Kaye schedule a meeting.
2530	This should be sent today.
2530	Stewart is the commercial person in Portland.
2530	Thanks.
2530	SS
2531	You are correct in that I do not need the emails.
2531	However, when I receive calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon Lotus Notes and the information is not there.
2531	I know that everyone is working diligently to satisfy the traders' requests.
2531	The emails you are sending can be entered directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.
2531	I will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.
2531	What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?
2532	Paul: I'll begin reviewing the comments but you'll have to think about the credit related issues.
2532	Let me know if you'd like to schedule some time to discuss.
2533	Stewart: I'd be glad to draft a "sample ISDA" for you and Jeff to use.
2533	Please verify that the type of counterparty you are looking at will be a On a related matter, we are still waiting to speak with Ed Sachs about the credit rating for the City of Portland and should have the agreement to you afterwards.
2534	Thanks - I'm sure glad one of us is thinking!
2535	Brant: I haven't heard of anyone pushing this internally but there are serious issues here because of the "agency" relationship that Energy New England has with various municipals.
2535	You want the municipals on the dotted line and not the agent.
2535	How do you want to handle?
2536	I am trying to locate the above identified master.
2536	Does anyone have this file?
2536	Sara
2537	Jorge: The Bank of Montreal ("BMO") master agreement provides for Market Quotation in the event of early termination for non-commodity based products.
2537	BMO prepared the letter to document our agreement to a different valuation methodology for the terminated transaction.
2537	Please execute the letter.
2537	P.S.
2537	Do know the difference between Market Quotation and Loss?
2538	Laurel: Please call me about Chase.
2538	Sara
2539	Do either of you have a copy of the "Power of Attorney" which the four municipal utilities granted to Energy New England LLC?
2539	I seem to recall a one or rwo paragraph document.
2539	Thanks.
2539	Sara
2540	Clem: Just wondering if I could have a response today on Bear Stearns.
2540	Gary Hickerson is anxioius to get this resolved today so that ENA can begin reducing margin rates with Bear.
2540	Thanks.
2541	Ed & Brant: I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.
2541	Brant prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.
2541	ENE "represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on behalf of those utilities.
2541	I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.
2541	Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.
2541	Should I drop this one altogether?
2541	Or are we interested in pursuing?
2541	Either Ed or Brant please let me know.
2541	Thanks.
2542	I received a call from Doug Sewall (midwest power) who wants to market this product to Canadian hydro utilities.
2542	Doug says that the product is originating from David Hoog's group and is an "insurance" type product for generation outage.
2542	Please let me know if anyone is familiar with this item.
2543	Stephanie: The fax that you gave to me with this file states that the CP wants to change jurisdiction "back to New York."
2543	I don't see a prior draft; only a blackline against a Weyerhaeuser Company LImited document, the latter ISDA having been executed in June, 2000.
2543	Does his question refer to that executed master?
2543	If so, please let me know what we agreed to.
2543	Thanks.
2544	Marcelo: Just checking to see if you had any information for me (default, time zone).
2544	Regards.
2545	Joe: Can you provide me with this information please?
2545	Thanks.
2546	Sheila: This agreement is for what futures products?
2546	Also, did you send a memo to Paul Radous/Bill Bradford and Cassandra Schultz?
2546	Thanks.
2546	Sara
2547	I need the file containing this executed agreement.
2547	We're opening an account in Japan.
2547	Thanks.
2548	Melissa: Before I can respond, I need to know the following answers: (1) What is the Exercise Period (Commencement/Expiration Dates) for the swaption and during what hours can we exercise?
2548	Is it from Jan. 2 - Feb 28, 2001 from 9 am to 11 am New York time?
2548	(2) Is the Commencement Date also the Premium Payment Date?
2548	(3) For early termination purposes, is there just a single Optional Early Termination Date or is it a period of time and during what hours?
2548	(4) Did we want to specify any Cash Settlement Reference Banks?
2548	I can mark this confirm quickly when I hear from you.
2548	Thanks.
2549	Cheryl: I'll finish this one.
2549	Sara
2550	Rhett: I am negotiating with First Union National Bank (Party B below).
2550	Is the following rep OK?
2550	"Party B is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America and is treated as a corporation for United States tax purposes."
2550	Why does the bank see the need for the latter clause?
2551	Richard: Highlighted below are changes to our standard confidentiality language requested by a banking counterparty to an ISDA agreement.
2551	Would you let meknow if it is acceptable?
2551	(i) Confidentiality.
2551	The contents of this Agreement and all other documentrelating to this Agreement, and any information made available by one partyor its Credit Support Provider to the other party or its Credit Support Provider with respect to this Agreement is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party (nor shall any public announcement relating tothis Agreement be made by either party), except for such information (i) asmay become generally available to the public, other than as a result of adisclosure in violation of the terms hereof (ii) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons, subpoena, or otherwise in connectiowith any litigation or to comply with any applicable law, order, regulationruling, or accounting disclosure rule or standard, whether in response thereto or upon initiation by either party in defending itself, reducing itliability, or protecting or exercising any of its claims, rights, remedies or interests under or in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction (iias may be obtained from a non-confidential source that disclosed such information in a manner that did not violate its obligations to the non-disclosing party or its Credit Support Provider in making such disclosure, or (iv) as may be furnished to the disclosing party,s Affiliates, and to each of such person,s auditors, attorneys, advisors or lenders whare required to keep the information that is disclosed in confidence. Thanks.
2552	Sharon: With respect to the ENE form of guaranty, we will agree to delete Paragraph 4 (setoff and counterclaims) in its entirety.
2552	This is a major concession by ENE.
2552	Can you now agree to the remainder of the ENE guaranty format?
2552	Please let me know.
2552	Thanks.
2553	Tanya: There are a few issues left: (1) [re: legal name of our counterparty] According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".
2553	If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.
2553	FUNB has asked that we forward the S&P document that you are looking at.
2553	(2) [re: FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor] FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.
2553	FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).
2553	FUNB annual financials also available on EDGAR.
2553	I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.
2553	(3) [re: 10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit Support] I don't know what the "usual haircut" is on these issues.
2553	You said 90% or 95%.
2553	Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we haven't discussed haircuts lately.
2553	(4) [re: the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and Credit Event Upon Merger] FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).
2553	If a Specified Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.
2553	(I think that we have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve Transactions).
2553	I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).
2553	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2553	Thanks.
2553	Sara
2554	Dee: I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.
2554	I would then propose preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.
2554	If I hear from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by Wednesday and we could talk.
2554	Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.
2554	Hope this works.
2554	Regards.
2555	Mark: I vote for a review of the act NOW, say the last week of February (Feb 26 - March 2).
2555	The ISDA seminar is the following week if that is an attraction for the speaker.
2555	I will give you a list of suggested issues in the next day or so.
2555	Have fun.
2556	Tanya: Our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex, omnibus and other forms and, specifically, the credit issues which arise in the preparation and negotiation of these documents.
2556	Our thought is to eventually offer regular instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer monthly seminars.
2556	In order to avoid "legal/credit Tuesday" boredom, we propose Wednesday or Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date.
2556	How does the week of February 19 or 26 sound?
2556	I believe that we can circulate a "curriculum" of sorts to you or at the least a listing of topics.
2556	Please let me know what you think.
2556	As always, we welcome your suggestions.
2557	Stephanie: Did this amendment include the weather rep as Cargill requested in late January?
2557	(see Lotus Notes entry)
2558	No - I received a single page which is the UBS standard blank form for "authorized traders".
2558	No names, no addresses, etc.
2559	Sam: Yesterday morning I needed to locate the latest ENA consent for authorized trading.
2559	Is it possible for you to keep a current set of these resolutions in a labelled notebook where everyone can access at all times?
2560	I've tabled this one.
2561	Sheila: here's the email; I'll call Sharon now.
2562	Richard: This is a first for me.
2562	I received the following objection to our standard arbitration language: "The arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited discovery and limited live testimony. This could take as long as in court and cost more."
2562	Is this a valid objection?
2562	If so, how should we amend our language?
2562	Or should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections (venue, forum) and waive jury trial?
2562	I look forward to hearing from you.
2562	Thanks.
2563	Dana: I haven't heard from credit.
2563	Why don't you call Tana Jones (our EOL paralegal specialist) at 713-853-3399 and let her know that you want to pursue the Electronic Trading Agreement and GTC's for online trading.
2563	I will also provide Tana with the background discussion that you and I had.
2563	At least she can get you moving on EOL and pursue credit at the same time.
2563	Let me know if you have any questions.
2563	Thanks.
2564	Tana: A lawyer from Amerada Hess (Dana Dellacona) will probably call you about EOL trading.
2564	She is interested in several trading relationships which you can see from the email that I sent to Tanya.
2564	Let me know if you have any questions.
2564	Thanks.
2565	I'm at my desk for about an hour.
2565	Then after 3 pm Houston time.
2566	Cheryl: Please handle.
2566	Thanks.
2567	You're right; I can't open the doc.
2568	Dee: I tried to call you about 30 minutes ago (together with my credit guys).
2568	We would really like to chat today.
2568	I have a meeting that will last about an hour.
2568	Please talk to my assistant Kaye Ellis (X35968) to try to talk at about 3pm Houston time.
2568	Thanks.
2569	Tanya: First Union has asked for the following: Choice 1: Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000/Rounding of $10,000 Choice 2: Minimum Transfer Amount of $250,000/Rounding of $10,000 We're almost done.
2569	Please email response tonight, if possible.
2569	Many thanks.
2569	Sara P.S.
2569	Do you have about 30 minutes to chat about all the things we seem to be voice/emailing about?
2570	We'll need to prepare the blackline in the morning.
2570	Thanks in advance for your help.
2571	Mark: Attached is my "short version" of Eligible Contract Participant (I would generally send to credit, new lawyer, etc.) I am still uncertain about the status of the Trade Option Exemption (Issue 4); I understood from the conversation that you, Brent and I had that the old rules were out.
2571	I have heard a different interpretation.
2571	What is the status of this exemption under the new law?
2572	Darren: (1) Goldman Sachs ENA executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. on June 15, 2000.
2572	Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to execute an additional agreement.
2572	I confirmed this with Ted Leh this morning.
2572	At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further documentation.
2572	I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by email.
2572	I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.
2572	I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.
2572	ENA and other Enron affiliates are already trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.
2572	Interestingly enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by a customer for online trading.
2572	In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy to let you access their platform.
2572	Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested execution of a "Client User List" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said to forget it.
2572	If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond with him (please send his email address), just let me know.
2572	Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.
2572	As a representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in place.
2573	Bob: Could you please forward changes to the Ag section to Kaye?
2573	Thanks.
2573	Sara
2574	Marcelo: Thanks for the info.
2574	I'm attaching comments to Appendix C. I also have someone reviewing Appendix B and am preparing Appendix A.
2575	Clem: Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. guaranty.
2575	A few points: (1) Bear claims that the "cap" language which we typically include is inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount.
2575	I've not heard of this before.
2575	I believe that they can send the treatise background info if you'd like.
2575	(2) The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with respect to the margin lending agreement.
2575	Bear has added "performance" to the guaranty as a guarantor obligation.
2575	ENA's account obligations pertain to the payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.
2575	Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is essentially reduced to a payment of money).
2575	(3) Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should refer to Par.
2575	5 to see their own version!
2575	Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with Bear.
2575	The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.
2575	Thanks.
2576	Dee: We are working on the blackline.
2576	Since the "deal" that you mentioned yesterday has no bearing on the master between ENA and FUNB, there is no emergency at hand.
2576	A few things to note: (1) regarding "Procedures for entering into Transactions," my suggestion is that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt of a confirmation.
2576	It is in both parties best interest to have an executed (and therefore enforceable) writing This can be accomplished by under the NY General Obligations law by our agreement as to a "deemed response" if a party will not sign a trade confirmation.
2576	(2) regarding the concept of "Specified Transaction", ENA has reconsidered the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified Conditions.
2576	It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions.
2576	Regarding the Credit Event Upon Merger, FUNB is protected with the amendment which we make to Section 5(b)(iv).
2576	I hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues.
2577	Cheryl: Enron Credit Inc. , a Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt trading currently handled by ENA.
2577	As a result, ENA will need to transfer its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those brokers.
2577	The brokers include our favorites: Bear Stearns Companies Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. Goldman Sachs & Co. ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
2577	Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the "sample package" (unanimous consent, authorized trader list).
2577	Will you please see that an email is sent to Richard with this information?
2577	We should begin the documentation now.
2577	Let me know if you have any questions.
2578	just check with bob late in the morning
2579	Trena: attached is an email from Joe Hunter which has some of your answers.
2579	You may want to chat with Shifali Sharma (I don't know her but will be glad to call).
2579	My guess is that many of the crude deals are brokered (maybe that's why the deals originate in Houston).
2579	I'm also forwarding to you Joe's message about traders.
2579	Please call me if we need to pursue further.
2579	SS
2580	Cheryl: Sheila can print out a listing of instruments to be assigned to each new Enron Credit Inc. account.
2580	The portfolio includes high-risk, high yield instruments.
2580	We should contact the brokers today or tomorrow for the form of agreements.
2580	Why don't you ask Stephanie or Sam to prepare three sets of assignments?
2580	They should coordinate with Sheila to identify the attachment.
2581	Clem: the Bear lawyer is Sharon Chernick phone: 212/272-2557 fax: 212/272-2727
2582	Stephanie: Please see me about a "draft ISDA municipal format".
2582	Let's talk as soon as you have a minute and prioritize.
2582	Thanks.
2582	Sara
2583	OK
2584	I think I inadvertently registered twice.
2584	Please delete the duplicate registration.
2584	Thank you.
2585	Richard: The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all reside in the U.K. I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in Houston.
2585	As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking for verification from Janine.
2585	My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement and include the usual "affiliates, representatives, etc."
2585	who may need to know any confidential information.
2585	Your V.P.'s are all in London.
2585	If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have a V.P.
2585	sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.
2585	At a minimum, though, we should try to work from our form of NDA.
2585	Let me know if you have any questions.
2586	I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to respond timely to the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron Corp. In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to obtain help.
2586	Would your group be able to put together some facts and projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties?
2586	Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for Clem to "plead his case."
2587	Stephanie: Let's prepare and submit for execution.
2587	Let me know if you have any questions.
2587	Thanks.
2588	Carson: I'm doing fine, thank you very much.
2588	It's about time to call Donna and raid somene's wine cellar and/or refrigerator.
2588	I'm not going out of town any time soon so let's pick a date.
2589	Guenther: Thanks for the response.
2589	I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns the information.
2589	Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).
2589	I do not know the "rule" for non-U.S. companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that information).
2590	Laurel: Cheryl Nelson is handling this and she will be back in the office on Monday.
2590	By copy of this message, I ask that she contact you.
2590	I believe that this is nearing completion.
2591	Ellen: Do you want me to contact the lawyer?
2592	Anna: Do want to prepare the Exhibits A and B or shall I?
2592	I would like to have the doc executed today.
2592	Also, please forward to me a copy of the final form of guaranty which you agreed to with Clement Abrams.
2592	Thanks.
2593	Anna: Attached is your form of agreement.
2594	In Section 5, the third paragraph, the reference prior to the deletion should read "the Counterparty" (and not "a Counterparty").
2595	Jeff: Do you have a preferance regarding the payment of "Default Interest"?
2595	Please let me know.
2596	Richard: Certainly ECL can execute the NDA.
2596	I am not the ECL lawyer.
2597	Tom: To whose attention should I direct comments to the Client Agreement?
2598	Sam: the addressee for the guaranty is : mmidden@anz.com (his name is Michael Midden) The message is : Attached for your immediate review is the form of Enron Corp. ("Enron") guaranty which would be utilized to guaranty all financial trading obligations pursuant to an ISDA Master Agreement and transactions thereunder which would be entered into between Enron North America Corp. and ANZ Bank.
2598	Jason Williams (in Enron's risk control group) asked that you receive a copy of Enron's form of guaranty if you had not already received one.
2598	We are in the process of preparing a draft ISDA Master Agreement and will forward it to you next week.
2598	Please let us know if you have any questions.
2598	Please copy Jay Williams and me.
2598	Thanks and sorry for such short notice.
2599	Anna: I have not seen the executed Enron Corp. guaranty this afternoon and I'll check with Enron Corp. when we reopen for business.
2599	We should talk first thing on Tuesday.
2599	A couple of items: (1) The Securities Loan Agreement is between Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Enron North America Corp. You requested The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. as the guaranty beneficiary (although that party is incorrectly stated as being party to the Securities Loan Agreement).
2599	I just wanted to verify your preference and we may want to modify the first page to be accurate.
2599	(2) As you requested that I prepare the Schedules A and B, I ask the following: (i) as to Schedule A, please submit your notice information (ii) as to Schedule B, we propose the default interest rate to be the Federal Funds Rate as defined in your agreement.
2599	Please respond and we can finalize the agreement.
2599	Please let me know if there is anything further you require.
2599	Regards.
2600	Jane: Susan is trying to revise the Services Agreement once again and the "governing law" issue was raised.
2600	I do not have any memoranda addressing which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp. However, I note that the draft ISDA marked by our Japanese counsel for use by Enron Japan Corp. and IBJ elects New York law (AA email to me dated 9/21/00).
2600	Are either Texas or New York law preferable for the Services Agreement?
2600	Thanks for your assistance.
2600	Regards.
2601	Welcome back!
2601	I've marked the new guaranty but I wanted to see the assignment first.
2601	I have the master file in my office.
2601	SS
2602	Please assign to the list of new masters for preparation and execution.
2603	Susan: Don't we always include "change of ownership"?
2603	Has credit ever requested anything different?
2604	Richard: Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties are impossible to meet (2/16/01 was last Friday).
2604	The same agreement with ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.
2604	Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ECI.
2604	Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal guaranty for ENA.
2605	Tanya: Further to Richard Sage's memo of earlier, are you handling credit for the Securities Loan Agreement which Richard is asking for ECI and Bear?
2606	and I'm going on Friday, 2/23 at the same time.
2607	Per my voice mail, see Par.
2607	5, second paragraph therein, "Beneficiary's" is the correct word.
2607	Your immediate reply is appreciated.
2607	Sara
2608	Cindy: Attached (very bottom) is the execution copy of the Bear Stearns guaranty.
2608	Please have this executed, together with the appropriate certificates.
2608	Thanks for your help.
2608	Also, let me know when the guaranty is ready.
2608	Sara
2609	Richard: Further to my message below, after speaking with Sheila, it appears that the Securities Loan Agreement that ENA will sign (hopefully tomorrow) is actually the same agreement to be used by Enron Credit Inc. ("ECI").
2609	I think we can have this assigned from ENA to ECI.
2609	We will have to get a new guaranty from Enron Corp. I still do not know anything about the Bear guaranty that you mentioned in your email.
2609	Please advise.
2609	Also, please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for ECI.
2609	If it is London, is there a services agreement in place between ENA and EI?
2610	Carlos: Attached are my comments to the LME product.
2610	Also, I understand that the forward and currency swap products are already online.
2610	I only noted that the reference to Greenwich Mean time in your draft appeared as "Greenwich Meantime".
2610	You may have already made this correction.
2611	Bob: Now there's the real reason!
2611	If there are two new softs entities, then ENA and ECTRIC lose the netting benefits.
2611	The tax issues are transparent (it's like the two credit derivative entities).
2611	Who is involved from credit?
2611	We need to discuss the structures with them because credit may be concerned about the loss of netting privileges.
2611	Also, we need to verify that US entity softs trades will be USD based and the European softs entity will settle in Euro or GBP.
2611	It seems obvious but a US entity could routinely settle in a currency other than USD.
2611	SS
2612	Tanya: Who in your group handles softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa)?
2612	As you may know, softs have been approved for OTC financial trading.
2612	We are currently structuring the softs trading entity(ies) and I think credit should be involved.
2612	Janine Juggins is handling tax.
2613	Susan: The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.
2613	I'm reviewing the GTC's.
2613	With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.
2613	I believe that the first week in March is the target EOL date.
2613	Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?
2613	I am not aware of any other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the totality of EOL products.
2613	Please call me if you have any questions.
2613	Thanks.
2614	Jeff and/or Rhett: Can you advise me as to Northern Border Partners, L.P. below?
2614	Thanks.
2615	Tanya: I don't know if Dow is trading financial, but if so, it looks as though we're having a problem.
2615	Who (in credit) will handle Dow?
2615	I'm expecting a call from the plastics guys once they read Mark's message below.
2615	By the way, I worked with Rod on this one Thanks.
2615	Sara
2616	Stephanie: I have the blue file in my office and a marked version of the ENE guaranty.
2616	However, we are missing the recent assisgnment from the NY office to London which you and I discussed last week.
2616	I was waiting for you to figure out whether the assignment is MIA.
2616	SS
2617	try early next week
2618	Richard: The Bear/ENA Securities Loan Agreement will be signed tonight and Bear should receive tomorrow morning.
2618	The Enron Corp. guaranty has been executed as well and will be included in the package.
2618	I will also ask Bear for an immediate assignment of the agreement to Enron Credit Inc. Sorry for the confusion over this agreement; I didn't realize that ENA was doing this for ECI.
2619	Janine: Congratulations on your promotion!
2619	I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc. (ECI) and Enron Credit Ltd. (ECL) Does London confirm the ECI trades?
2619	If so, I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.
2619	Or will ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?
2619	I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley could sign for ENA because he was in London.
2619	I believe this was in relation to the credit business.
2619	Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA?
2619	Any reason not to use ECI or ECL here?
2619	Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any companies performing services on behalf of either ECI or ECL?
2619	Thanks.
2620	Anna: I just received your voice mail.
2620	The package (including the Enron Corp. guaranty) has already gone out via Federal Express to your attention.
2620	You should receive it tomorrow.
2620	Also, Enron North America Corp. would like to assign the agreement to Enron Credit Inc. (a Delaware corporation).
2620	Would you like for me to prepare the assignment or shall I?
2620	Please advise.
2620	Thanks.
2621	Sheila: Just a few questions about this futures agreement: (1) Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and JP's affiliates?
2621	(2) Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return "property of like or equivalent kind or amount"?
2621	(3) Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or only "as agreed from time to time"?
2622	Susan: You've just hit the nail on the head!
2622	Remember, for FX trading ENA is always the principal, either in Houston, through EEFT as agent (under services agreement which I presume covers FX deals) or Enron Japan Corp. (under services agreement).
2622	Most problematic are the counterparties since they could originate from anywhere in the world.
2622	I have heard that Enron Japan had some GTC's that contained "universal tax reps" but I haven't checked it out.
2622	Why don't you give me a call.
2623	Paul: I am negotiating a new futures agreement for Gary.
2623	Do have any input?
2623	Thanks.
2624	Sam: There are now two entries for J.P. Morgan Futures, Inc. I didn't realize that you had entered an agreement.
2624	I didn't want to delete your entry but I don't understand what you entered.
2624	Is it a futures agreement?
2624	I am negotiating the futures agreement.
2624	Also, the email address you entered is incorrect.
2624	Please help.
2625	Mary: How are you entering your margin line credit agreements in Lotus Notes (if they are being registered at all)?
2626	Yes, it does.
2626	Thanks so much.
2627	FYI - yes, Wes Colwell and his crew are ENA accounting; however, they know nothing of FAS 125/133, as I was directed to Chris Sherman.
2628	I'm sending my comments to Thomas Alterson within the hour.
2628	He is not the lawyer.
2629	Thomas: Attached is a redline of the Client Agreement.
2629	I know that Gary Hickerson will be meeting with J P Morgan early next week and would like to have this agreed.
2629	Please advise as to what attorney will review my comments and put me in touch with that person today.
2629	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2629	Thanks.
2630	Dale and Tracy: We have never received a credit worksheet for preparation of a draft ISDA in either the name of Nevada Power (Company) or Sierra Pacific Resources.
2631	Janine: I would like to meet with you (and Guenther) regarding two topics: (1) softs trading (together with Bob Bruce) (2) credit trading (do we need anyone else?) Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.
2631	Let me propose 9 am Tuesday for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).
2631	Bob and I are located only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.
2631	We look forward to hearing from you.
2632	Marcelo: Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian form of repo agreement.
2632	Please note the following: (1) You attached "Annex II" to the end of Appendix C. That annex came from the US repo with Merrill.
2632	The information should actually be incorporated into "Appendix A" of your repo agreement.
2632	(2) I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default issue.
2632	(3) Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).
2632	We should be ready to execute shortly.
2632	Thanks.
2633	fine with me.
2633	I thought Susan might have a problem on Tuesday morning (for the credit piece).
2634	Any possibility of a conference room on Tuesday, Feb 27 from 10 am - 12 pm?
2635	Cheryl: Will you please respond to this new request.
2635	Thanks.
2635	Sara
2636	Stephanie: Where did we end up?
2637	Cheryl: Goldman is one of the brokers "messed up" in Lotus Notes.
2637	I had given you the files some time ago with my comments.
2637	I think it would make sense for us to sort through Goldman for all affiliated companies.
2637	I don't see an agreement in Lotus Notes for ECT Inv.
2637	and Goldman Int'l.
2638	Theresa Brogan needs a link to the database.
2638	She works in Gary Hickerson's group.
2638	Thanks.
2639	FYI
2640	(1) The ENA Securities Loan Agreement/ENE Guaranty was received by Bear on 2/22.
2640	Bear is preparing a form of assignment from ENA to Enron Credit Inc. (2) JP Morgan sending comments to Futures Agreement (3) I am reviewing Chase custody agreement.
2640	I need info on a legal contact at Chase.
2640	(4) ML Canada repo.
2640	Waiting for response.
2640	(4) Enron Credit Inc. accounts.
2640	Preparing form of assignment for all three accounts.
2640	Cheryl opening the accounts.
2640	NOTE: In general, Cheryl will be responsible for opening accounts.
2641	Marcelo: We need to eliminate Appendix B altogether.
2641	We have previously agreed to eliminate substitution and FAS 125 does not require substitution.
2641	I have only one more issue to resolve.
2641	Will you revise again?
2642	There are multiple Goldman files.
2642	I do have the"ENA/GS&Co."
2642	online agreement only.
2642	I have it only for reference as it has been executed.
2642	The problem I'm referring to is the identification of the Lotus Notes Goldman files.
2642	We can catch up in our meeting which I have scheduled for Monday.
2643	No, I forgot that the agreement was with ECTRIC.
2644	Corinne: Thanks so much for the voice and emails.
2644	I'm reviewing your comments now and ask that you please forward your rate schedule and arbitration language/reg.
2645	Caroline: I am reviewing Moore comments.
2645	Brent Hendry is handling Catequil.
2645	I don't know what Paloma is.
2646	Sam: Will you please respond to Luis?
2646	Thanks.
2647	Marcelo: I have no further comments.
2647	Will you please send the final blackline.
2647	Thanks.
2648	Steve: I thought you might be interested.
2649	Corinne A. Samon Tel: 212-648-4292 Fax: 212-648-5589 message: Attached is our response to your suggested form of arbitration language.
2650	Corinne: I just sent you a fax re: arbitration.
2650	I have not heard from your salesperson re: interest schedule for debit rate (Sec. 2) and credit rate (Sec. 6).
2650	Thanks.
2651	Yes, please.
2651	Let's look at the .com master before we do anything.
2651	The Enron Corp. master should be "easier".
2652	Sheila: Regarding the JP Morgan ("JP") Futures Agreement, please see the attached for debit and credit rates which JP charges its customers.
2652	I asked for (1) agreed to overnight rate for debit rate and (2) Fed Funds for interest rate.
2652	Please let me know if you are agreeable to the attached rates.
2652	SS
2653	Paul: Laurel Adams told me that you would provide me with a name and phone number of someone at Chase for purposes of negotiating the global custody account.
2653	Do you have any information?
2653	Thanks.
2654	Melissa: I went back to your original draft of confirmation and edited it, as attached.
2655	Mara: Are we done?
2655	I don't think we have heard from you about the master?
2655	Can we go ahead and have the guaranty executed?
2655	I don't think we have any outstanding issues.
2656	Mark: A few years ago we sought California legal advice for transacting with California cities.
2656	We have an opinion from McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Should we update this opinion given the increased number of cities with whom we are sending draft ISDA's to?
2656	If so, which law firm do you think we should hire?
2657	Paul: Why don't you and I speak about the Enron concerns first.
2657	I've reviewed the agreement and have a couple of questions about how we intend to use the account.
2657	I'm available this morning before 10 am and after 3 pm this afternoon.
2657	And I'm free all day tomorrow.
2657	Thanks.
2657	Sara p.s.
2657	Do we need to bring in someone from Gary's group (e.g., Sheila Glover)?
2658	FYI
2659	Blacklined version sent to FTU.
2659	If accepted, ENA can execute today.
2660	Carol: I've not reviewed these (my apologies) and I'd ask until Thursday, if possible.
2660	Please let me know.
2660	I will block off this afternoon to focus.
2661	Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the above company?
2661	I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a policy - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA agreement.
2661	This could be related to credit activity in London.
2661	I am waiting to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.
2662	Frank: Did you ever send out comments on TVA?
2662	I didn't see an update in Lotus Notes.
2662	Please let me know as I would like to call Joe back.
2663	Brent: Carol St. Clair does not work on Fridays.
2663	Can you reschedule your lunch for another day?
2664	Corinne: Attached is your arbitration language (marked) and our arbitration text.
2664	I hope this does it!
2664	Thanks.
2665	Denis: I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.
2665	Where do you want the executed documents sent?
2665	As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London has access.
2665	Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by London in the name of ENA.
2665	These agreements should also be logged onto the ENA database.
2665	Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?
2665	Will all trades be assigned?
2665	If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?
2665	Thanks.
2666	Melissa: Why can't we state the Total NQ in MWh's (rather than simply MWs/hr)?
2666	I think the physicial confirms provide for a total contract quantity.
2667	Mary: Do you have a form of "approved" assignment for transferring trades into the Raptor vehicle?
2668	Cheryl: Please be sure to schedule our regular meeting with credit.
2668	We missed you yesterday.
2669	Are the two electronic trading agreements for ENA and ECT Investments with different Bear entities?
2669	I am currently revising the institutional account agreement for ENA as part of my negotiation of the Securities Loan Agreement.
2669	I don't want to "trip over" the two referenced agreements.
2670	Brenda: Thanks.
2670	Also, do you have a Raptor IV minibook?
2670	We don't have any Raptor IV documentation.
2670	Do both swap parties intend to transfer positions?
2671	Mark: Cargill is asking us to execute with Cargill's agent a document permitting the agent to act for Cargill online and offline with respect to financial trades.
2671	Will we permit?
2672	Kaye: Can you please fax a confirm for me?
2672	It's in my office.
2672	Thanks.
2673	Caroline: Carol St. Clair (X33989) is looking into this.
2674	Joel: Carol will give you a call about this.
2674	Thanks.
2675	No - you never answered my email of 2/27.
2676	Stephanie: Did you locate a copy of our ML assignment?
2677	Susan: Does Frank have this file?
2677	Jay: Is John off this deal?
2678	Stephanie: Please forward per the message.
2678	We need to keep a file for this agreement.
2679	Denis: We'll forward originals per your message.
2679	I would appreciate your compliance with the remainder of my message.
2679	Thanks for your help.
2680	Working great!
2681	Anna: As promised, I am reviewing your new form of account agreement (as well as the assignment).
2681	Can you please tell me WHAT document the new account agreement was marked against?
2681	It is not marked against ENA's existing agreement dated "January, 1997".
2681	Regards.
2682	I appreciate your message.
2682	Just let the group know if you're unable to attend.
2683	Wendi: Caroline wants a quick response.
2683	What issues do you have?
2684	Can I have a copy?
2685	Denis: Per my voice mail, please advise which ENA officer will execute your documents for ENA.
2685	When we hear from you, we can have the docs executed and delivered.
2685	Also, we need copies of the executed ENA masters and the information entered into Lotus Notes.
2685	Thanks for your help.
2686	Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys in January, 2001.
2686	I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.
2686	I discussed the confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms were being marked inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading without any changes at all.
2686	He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer, I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).
2687	Frank: I think his changes were with respect to addresses, accounts, etc. Do we need to include an affirmative statement by AG that it assumes all obligations under the Master?
2687	I'm neutral.
2688	Frank: Do you have the Glencore file?
2689	Susan: Looks like it worked.
2689	Can you please repsond to John's request?
2690	Denis: Please arrange with Jeff to have someone available to sign as Jeff can explain the purpose of your deal.
2690	When executed, we can fax per your earlier email.
2690	If necessary, get Jeff and Samantha on the phone.
2691	John: I hope you are able to locate an executed ISDA Master Agreement between RMT and EECC inasmuch as neither our database nor files reflect one.
2691	, I've asked Susan Bailey to resend the draft Schedule.
2691	In the event that we need to execute this Schedule, you should provide us with appropriate notice information.
2691	We can then prepare execution originals.
2691	Let me know if you need further assistance.
2691	Thanks.
2692	With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., "AAA"), and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award punitive, exemplary or similar damages.
2692	Because these are fairly old forms, I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.
2692	I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.
2693	I think these guys are trying to create a $35M line ($15M Collateral Threshold from the ISDA Credit Support Annex and a separate $20M line for the Global agency trading).
2693	All trading with Cargill will be subject to the ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex.
2693	Wendi and I discussed briefly and we'll call you later.
2693	It seems that Wendi has spoken with Mark Rubenstein who handles credit and there is some confusion.
2694	Wendi: Following is a quick message I shot off to Caroline.
2694	She will wait for us to call.
2695	Dee: Let me know if we need to discuss anything.
2695	I am hopeful that we are ready to prepare execution copies.
2695	Regards.
2696	I don't know anything about these transactions.
2697	"Calculation of Floating Amount: The Floating Amount payable by [ENA] on a Payment Date will be calculated for that Payment Date as follows: Floating Amount = (Notional Quantity per Calculation Period X Floating
2698	"Other Provisions: On each Payment Date, [ENA] shall pay [a fee of] [an amount equal to] USD{38,000?], which amount shall be subject to the netting provisions of the [Master Agreement - how do you refer to the agreement?]"
2699	looks fine
2700	Pat: I've finished reviewing the confirms and am missing the following FX confirmations: (1) National Bank of Canada 4/25/01 maturity (2) Scotia Bank maturities for 5/8/01, 6/8/01, 7/8/01 and 8/8/01 Also, if you have added more transactions beyond your January 31, 2001 summary, we would like copies.
2700	Other than with respect to the two Forward Extras with Bank of America, are there any restrictions in your credit agreements with the various banks that require notice and/or consent (with respect to forward positions) when there is a change of ownership, etc. (as to Daishowa)?
2701	Interesting.
2701	Morgan just proposed language similar to my earlier email (for a futures agreement but the language mirrors that used on the brokerage side).
2701	Maybe its unenforceable.
2702	Hi, Tanya: I received another call from Dana Dellacona at Hess asking about online and offline trading.
2702	I'll direct her once again to Tana for online trading.
2702	I'll ask her again to describe the products they want to trade.
2702	Will you evaluate?
2703	Dana: I received your call.
2703	I have not heard from credit.
2703	There are two things that you can do in the meantime.
2703	(1) For online trading, please call Tana Jones at 713-853-3399 (2) Please advise what physical and financial products you want to trade.
2703	I believe that you didn't know when we last spoke.
2703	Thanks.
2704	Jason: In connection with the above captioned invoice, there are two entries for "T.J. Perich" ($850) for reviewing underlying swap documents, opinion.
2704	Is this your New York lawyer handling the SMUD opinion?
2705	Dave Adams' phone number iw 612-373-5388
2706	Mark: I just received a copy of my "IOU/municipal" chart from last year with an undated note from you about our omnibus format/IOU's.
2706	I would like to speak with you especially since I'm speaking with credit about municipals on Wednesday.
2706	As a practical matter, I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities on the omnibus.
2706	Perhaps Tana can answer the question as to online trading and the confirmation desk as to offline trading.
2706	Secondly, I'm not sure how often the Additional Event of Default is successfully negotiated into the ISDA Agreement.
2706	The latter point might be worth an email to the lawyers.
2706	Do you have a few minutes today?
2707	Frank: Brant's worksheet contains the remaining items for the amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement.
2707	Brant: Your credit worksheet is in the name of "Glencore Ltd.".
2707	Since we're amending the master to reflect Glencore's home office as our counterparty, please verify that your credit is appropriate for "Glencore SA".
2708	Sorry!
2708	Please ignore my prior message.
2709	Brant: Please send complete copies of these confirms (including the Annexes!)
2710	Mary: Do you want to answer Laurel?
2710	I haven't heard anything further about "paperless confirms".
2710	I'll also ask Mark for an update.
2710	Thanks.
2711	Mark: Where do we stand on this issue?
2712	FYI
2713	Let's talk in the a.m.
2714	Brent will talk with you.
2715	Marie: We have a physical and financial jurisdictional survey conducted by ENA in 1996.
2715	I don't see an ISDA opinion but you can easily verify on the IDSA website.
2715	Please let me know which surveys you need and we'll have them sent over.
2715	Let me know if you have any other questions.
2716	Ed: I need to understand factually what is happening.
2716	All transactions between ENA and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing should be subject to the existing ISDA between ERMS and Vastar Gas Marketing Inc., as amended.
2716	The existing guaranty from Vastar Resources, Inc. applies to all trades through approximately the end of this week Who have you spoken with at Mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last Friday?
2716	It appears that Mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new guaranty is in place.
2716	Frank has contacted Mirant legal and are in agreement in principle as to the new guaranty from Mirant Corporation.
2716	However, we understand that this entity will be spun off in the near future and the credit could change substantially.
2716	Have you given thought to the effect of the new guaranty?
2716	Also, have we traded today with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing?
2716	Online or offline?
2716	We should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save tapes if we are having problem Call.
2716	We will negotiate a new ISDA in the next few months
2717	All: I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between CP and ENA.
2717	The immediate plan is as follows: (1) Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation (Frank to send draft in the a.m.) (2) Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send draft in the a.m.) (3) Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will prepare) (4) Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may consider).
2717	If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.
2717	Thanks.
2718	no
2719	Attached is a list of high volume "old" ECT Masters which was obtained from the confirmation desk.
2719	Many of them appeared on our working list from last year.
2719	Tanya: We have enough legal help to pursue the names on the list.
2719	Would you like to prioritize or amend?
2720	Nicole: Attached is a draft of a short letter agreement which our respective companies can execute to confirm our understanding that there has been no lapse in trading between the two companies.
2720	We are awaiting your amendment of the ISDA.
2721	Frank: FYI.
2721	Let's tell her that we can execute the : (1) letter (2) the separate ISDA amendment (3) our understanding (together with Vastar's) of the "old" guaranty.
2721	I have a doctor's appointment at noon but I'll be back afterwards.
2722	Sheila: The attached information may help you with respect to the JP Morgan Futures Agreement.
2722	I will let the lawyer know that we still have the issue under consideration.
2722	Thanks.
2723	Corinne: Thanks for the message.
2723	We have not yet resolved the interest issue.
2723	But it is the only issue left.
2723	Please retain the second signature for Singapore trading.
2723	I hope to have an answer early next week.
2724	Dee: No answer on your phone!
2724	Monday morning works fine; I've put you down for 10 am Houston time and I'll call you.
2724	Contact my assistant Kaye Ellis if this doesn't work (713-853-5968).
2724	I'm busy from 2 - 4 pm Houston.
2724	Also, Susan Bailey will be unable to answer your questions, so let's wait until we speak.
2725	FYI - you don't need to respond to Dee
2726	Richard: Does Enron Credit Inc. have U.S. resident officers/directors?
2726	Cheryl Nelson is trying to set up three U.S. brokerage accounts and needs signatories.
2726	Please let Cheryl know.
2726	Thanks.
2727	Attached is the form of assignment (for future reference).
2728	Stewart: I spoke with Jeff and he will arrange a conference call next week with the tribe's CFO and legal counsel.
2728	I highlighted the "eligibility" (eligible to enter into swaps under the CFTC regulations) and jurisdictional issues for Jeff regarding Indian tribes.
2728	Of course, all of the other governmental counterparty concerns are here as well.
2728	The tribe is located in Oregon.
2728	I'll follow up with you next week.
2729	Kim: Will you be available for this "municipal ISDA" meeting?
2730	Tanya: I have been reviewing some of Gary Hickerson's older master agreements which may require amending (to provide for multibranch transactions).
2730	I wanted to verify which master we are relying on for UBS AG.
2730	The files are a little confusing but it appears that we use the May 31, 1993 Swiss Bank Corporation master (and not the March 15, 1994 master with Union Bank of Switzerland).
2730	Do you have any recollection of this?
2731	Caroline: Sorry I wasn't able to reach you today and I will be out of the office tomorrow.
2731	If this can wait until Monday, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis (X35968) and get on my calendar early Monday.
2731	If this cannot wait, please contact Mark Taylor (X37459) and he may be able to find a lawyer to assist you.
2731	In general, I thought that Wendi was waiting to hear back from Cargill Incorporated credit.
2731	Once we understood what Cargill was looking for, I was hoping to speak with their lawyer and agree to eliminate all of the provisions appearing in the draft POA which did not really concern ENA.
2731	Recall that ENA does not want to monitor Cargill's agent: that's an internal job for Cargill.
2731	I hope that we can speak on Monday.
2731	Maybe you can coordinate tomorrow with Wendi.
2731	Thanks.
2732	Nicole: I hope you and Frank can finalize everything tomorrow.
2732	Thanks for your help.
2733	Thanks.
2733	Since you and Carol are handling Enron "equity" deals, I passed my Raptor IV assignment on to Carol.
2734	Carol: Tanya's comments.
2734	Let's go ahead with the "conversion" per Tanya.
2735	Here's one of them.
2736	Caroline: I'll call you this morning.
2737	Cheryl: Anna called me at about 5 pm this evening and would like for you to give her a status call first thing in the morning.
2738	Richard: Thanks.
2738	Your chart indicates that Callahan (I don't know who this is) is working on the director/officer changes.
2738	Just keep me up to date.
2738	Thanks.
2739	Kim: See if this link works.
2739	Sara
2740	Hi, Steve: We am preparing a form of assignment from ECT Investments, Inc. in favor of Enron North America Corp. whch will transfer several credit derivative Transactions.
2740	I anticipate an attachment to the assignment which will identify the trades.
2740	I believe that Bill Bradford (Ernon) and Mark Tarkington have discussed these trades and Bill is sending me the list.
2740	Please let me know that you are aware of this request.
2740	Thanks.
2741	Carol: Thanks so much for your good wishes.
2741	I really value your opinion and consider you a major asset to the swap group (I actually give myself a "pat on the head" for being able to entice you to join the group).
2741	I look forward to lunch next week.
2741	Sara
2742	I don't have the list yet but I'll forward the info to you immediately upon receipt.
2743	Paul: Just checking to see if you are the lawyer monitoring equity trading in the U.K. I am charged with the oversight of Gary Hickerson's equity activity here in Houston and I want to coordinate with the London lawyer.
2743	Please advise.
2743	Also, I heard that you were recently married.
2743	Congratulations!
2744	Susan: Will you do a favor for me, please?
2744	As you will see from the email below, Denis O'Connell in London has had two ISDA's executed in the name of ENA.
2744	We need to log this into Lotus Notes and we have not received copies (and Denis will not log onto Lotus Notes).
2744	Thanks.
2744	Also, did we ever resolve that RMT problem with EECC?
2745	FYI
2746	No, I would like to meet with you individually to discuss the unenforceability issues with respect to brokerage agreements.
2746	Our 11 am will be short.
2746	The afternoon meeting will be with Sam, Stephanie and the two of us.
2747	Attached is the most recent listing from Aneela.
2747	Please bring to our 1:30 meeting this afternoon.
2748	Per my voice mail of date, please feel free to contact me aboutthe 2/1/01 gas floor.
2748	As I mentioned in my voice mail, the ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions provide for the Floating Amount language for caps and floors (see Section 6.2).
2748	"Exercise" language is not necessary as this is addressed in the referenced definitions.
2749	Mr. Geoffrey Pack; Per Sarah Heineman's earlier discussion with you, Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") will shortly email to you the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.
2749	We do not have ISDA boilerplate in word format and assume that you have such documents.
2749	If not, please let us know.
2749	We received internal credit information in mid-January.
2749	Unfortunately, the derivatives legal group at ENA has been short staffed until very recently so we apologize for the delay in submitting draft documentation to you.
2749	We did email the Enron Corp. form of guaranty to Michael Midden on 2/16/01.
2749	We are currently working with Jay Williams (credit) to respond to any credit issues and John Suttle has transferred to our Australia office.
2749	Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
2749	Sara Shackleton Assistant General Counsel Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas 77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax)
2750	Frank: Please email as soon as possible to the address below.
2750	I have already sent a short email to Geoffrey Pack explaining the delay.
2750	Thanks.
2750	Samantha: Please enter latest into, including email, address, etc., into Lotus Notes.
2750	Thanks.
2751	Tana: I think the agreement is listed in Section 1 (all agreements) which is not just Master Swap Agreements.
2751	It is also listed in the approprate Section 13 entry.
2751	Hope you're enjoying Canada!
2752	You need to speak with the developer.
2752	There is no way to control the inclusion of "Other Agreements" in the "All Agreements" section as the system is currently designed.
2752	I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.
2752	The system is confusing.
2753	Sam: Please prepare ASAP.
2753	The Merrill party referenced is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services" which we'll need to review.
2754	I NEED!
2755	Joe: Per my voice mail.
2755	SS
2756	Please see if the attached format documents the par forward transactions in a manner more like CIBC (and a little different than the ENA format).
2756	Stuart: I'll send the GTC's to you for review today.
2756	I'm updating the ISDA format used in the global weather transactions (which are the only products using this format).
2756	We may need to adjust the product description.
2757	Laurie: My info is below.
2757	I'll call you at 2 pm Houston (3 pm NY) to discuss the ISDA which we'll email shortly.
2757	Please feel free to call before then.
2757	Thanks.
2758	Thank you!
2758	(as usual, you're a life saver)
2759	Frank: BEWARE!
2759	This ISDA was almost finalized but for disagreement about assignment and arbitration (so there's not much in the Annex A to dispute).
2759	Check Lotus Notes first and add to this file.
2760	Dee: I'm in the midst of a closing; can you email language to me?
2761	Am in the middle of a closing.
2761	Can't promise anything.
2762	Kate: Per my voice mail, I suggest the following as paragraph 2 to the Transfer and Assumption Agreement: "WHEREAS, ....options for sale and purchase of physical energy commodities, in the case of EPMI (the "EPMI ransactions") or certain financial swaps, options or other financially settled derivative transactions, in the case of Also, am working on the jurisdiction issue. Please call me at 713-705-1823 email me per below AND : sshackl@swbell.net Thanks. Sara
2763	My cell number is 713-705-1823.
2763	Please call me as you need me.
2763	Alternative email: sshackl@swbell.net
2764	Can you handle or should Carol?
2765	(1) I cannot speak with Caroline Abramo at 2.
2765	Please call her and explain that I'm in the midst of transaction which must close today (it may roll into Monday).
2765	Tuesday is a safe bet.
2765	Mention that the deal is being pushed by the 50th floor over here.
2765	(2) Did you call Stuart?
2765	Just let me know and I'll call him when I get off this call.
2766	Sorry, Frank Sayre will call you or feel free to contact him (X57894).
2767	Clem: attached is the guaranty.
2767	I'll call you soon.
2767	SS
2768	Cheryl: Should you have any SEC issues (whether these are reps or forms to be completed, you should check with Travis or Lance (or anyone suggested by them). As you may know, ENA has an affiliated registered broker-dealer (and that fact could be pertinent in some type of rep). Thanks. Cheryl Nelson@ENRON Cheryl Nelson@ENRON
2769	2:45 Houston time is fine for me.
2769	Also, the Trading Limitation language is NOT intended to kick in for intraday limit moves but only at the end of the day (i.e., "closing or settlement price").
2769	We want the language to remain the same.
2769	Hope this works.
2769	Sara
2770	Sorry for the mixup.
2770	Attached is template for confirm and then the GTC (minus tax reps).
2770	I'm trying to fit in the tax reps in between phone calls and will distribute to Susan Musch (tax) for review.
2770	Stuart: Who else should be on the review list?
2770	Thanks.
2770	Sara
2771	Kate: A few points about the last draft of the Agreement: (1) Par.
2771	1(a): the transfer and assumption is effective as of March 16, 2001 and not as of the Collateral Return (2) Par.
2771	1(d): the parties have already agreed to use one set of spreadsheets (3) Par.
2771	3: the ML&Co.
2771	guaranties are not being released because there are existing deals in place.
2771	The guaranties will only be released as to the transferred Transactions (4) Par.
2771	6: conform language to side letters (5) Par.
2771	8: Please delete the last two sentences.
2771	Enron will agree to be silent as to court actions, costs and attorneys fees.
2771	Please call at 713-853-5620 (Sara) or 713-853-1794 (Janice).
2771	Regards.
2772	DONE.
2772	Sara
2773	Thanks for the reply!
2774	Kaye: Would you please reschedule my lunch with Carol to sometime next week (not Tuesday or Wednesday).
2774	Thanks.
2774	Sara
2775	FYI
2776	FYI
2777	Lauren: (1) Par.
2777	3(xiii) second and fourth lines: the word "Guaranty" should be replaced by the word "guaranty" and the words "the Guaranty" should be replaced with "that guaranty", respectively.
2777	(2) Exhibit B Guaranty, first and final paragraphs: change the date to
2778	Samantha Boyd had a death in her family early this morning and I do not know when she will return to work.
2778	I do not know her computer password she is working on time sensitive documents with correspondence being done through email.
2778	Please reset her computer password and lotus notes password so I may access the correspondence.
2778	Please notify me of the new passwords.
2778	Thank you,
2779	The Schedule III, No. 2 agreement dated December 28, 1999 is irrelevant and confusing to list for this assignment.
2780	Stephanie: at the moment, you'll find an attached exhibit B which is the ENE guaranty.
2780	Check with me in the a.m. thanks.
2781	Corinne: We will accept your interest rate schedules.
2781	Also, you can include the witness line for our signatory.
2781	Please prepare execution copies and let me know if there is anything else to be done.
2781	Thanks for your patience.
2782	Tracy: I just spoke wtih Stewart about this counterparty and the fact that you previously prepared credit (for physical trading).
2782	Please send a credit worksheet for financial trading and we can deliver a draft ISDA to the lawyer per Stewart's instructions.
2782	Let me know if you have any questions.
2782	Thanks.
2783	Please review the GTC's for the Canadian FX product.
2783	Stuart: Please call about your form of confirmation.
2783	Carlos: We may want to amend the descriptions to match the "ISDA language" contained in the GTC's.
2784	Lisa: I don't know anything about this swap and Mary is on vacation.
2784	Would you please provide me with more information about the swap, deadlines, etc.?
2784	Thanks.
2785	Cheryl: Where do we stand on the ECT Credit Inc. three (3) accounts?
2785	Richard: Do you have the proposed U.S. slate for Teresa?
2785	We do not know who you want as officers/directors.
2786	She did not know anything about a new swap.
2787	Susan: This may look confusing!
2787	It contains all of our "choices" for preparing the documents.
2787	See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document which has our "choices" of tax forms.
2787	I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.
2787	We tend to not "think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft documents.
2788	DONE!
2788	Don't worry about this - I'll let you know about our next meeting.
2788	Thanks for your help as I really appreciate it.
2789	Gordon: Please advise Carol, Mary and me.
2789	Thanks.
2790	Mark: This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).
2790	Her priorities are not currently with the swap group.
2790	Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.
2790	I don't know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.
2790	Last night we received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover.
2790	Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.
2791	Russell: I received your voice mail about the one (1) year financial trade done between ENA and CP.
2791	The three-month limitation on trades is only an internal ENA control which was imposed by credit some years ago.
2791	Please refer to Lotus Notes for a more comprehensive explanation.
2791	The Master Agreement has been executed.
2791	However, CP was unable to render a legal opinion vouching for "blanket" enforceability of the trades due to conflicting PUC orders which are still in effect today.
2791	What is credit's position when your internal policy is violated?
2791	Who was the trader?
2791	Have you spoken with the trader?
2792	Tracy: Thanks for your continued assistance in this transaction.
2792	Would you please send me a copy of the "Schedule I" listing of transactions which were transferred to Allegheny?
2793	Teresa: Your emails have not gone unheeded!
2793	We were facilitating things for Richard and he needs to let us know his slate for the U.S. segment of the London business.
2793	We'll wait to hear from Richard.
2793	If you have any questions please give me a call.
2793	Thanks.
2794	Justin: I haven't heard from you in some time now.
2794	How is everything?
2794	Are you going to be in San Antonio?
2794	I wanted to set up a short call to discuss equity trading and what Houston and London can do (are doing?) to stay abreast of activity and developments on the trading desks.
2794	Please let me know a convenient time for you.
2794	Thanks.
2795	Yes, we distributed several memoranda to the group before Ken Raceler's talk.
2795	You should have received one.
2796	Tracy: These guys emailed only names of lawyers, accountants, etc.!
2796	Rawleigh White is the CFO for the tribe.
2796	The "broker" intermediary is Jeff Fuller with Power Resources Managers (425-451-9123) who told me that the tribe is an Oregon tribe located in Bend, Oregon.
2796	I will separately send you Stewart's prior message.
2796	I'll send these guys a draft (without credit).
2796	Thanks.
2797	Here's the other message.
2798	Susan: I agreed with Kim Farr at First Union to send our resolution (with certificate).
2798	When you have a chance, would you please handle.
2798	Thanks.
2798	(p.s. - First Union will be an important equity trading partner for Enron Corp. and we'll be dealing with the same lawyers, etc.)
2799	Kim and Jay: Attached is the format which we last discussed.
2799	Remember, this is what we require for municipals and governmental entities.
2799	Call if you have any quesitons.
2799	Thanks.
2800	Here's a recap for everyone.
2800	Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.
2800	However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we negotiate a new agreement.
2800	I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.
2800	We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc..
2800	("ECI").
2800	We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.
2800	The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI.
2800	It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.
2800	Jeff and Sheila: Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not need the Securities Loan Agreement.
2800	I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI.
2801	Stewart: I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the other day.
2801	Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the Tribe/lawyers a "sample ISDA without credit" which is not specific to the Tribe.
2801	The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an "eligible contract participant" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.
2801	Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance the purchase of the two dams.
2801	Can you please address for West Origination and respond to Raleigh?
2801	Thanks.
2802	Susan: I've spoken with a new Indian tribe and need to send the "sample governmental ISDA" to several people.
2802	I"ll forward the names/addresses to you. Stewart Rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as Tracy Ngo. Please include the following message (verify the question I left for you) with the attachment: "Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.
2802	We will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit group has concluded its review.
2802	You may already be familiar with the ISDA Municipal Counterparty Schedule and will note that although we are incorporating many of those provisions.
2802	We assume that you have the ISDA boilerplate (for the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex).
2802	Please let us know if you have any questions."
2803	Attached are the email addresses.
2804	Cheryl: You may want to mention to Anna (Bear) that ENA would like to transfer the Securities Loan Agreement to Enron Credit Inc., retrieve the ENE guaranty for ENA and have Enron Credit Inc. guaranteed under a new ENE guaranty.
2805	Kaye: Please send this fax (I have the info if you still need it).
2806	Please forward your comments.
2806	Thanks.
2807	Sorry, the product must be ready next week.
2808	Sheila: Thanks for the message.
2808	I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge ENA.
2808	He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.
2808	I thought you might want to have this bit of information.
2808	Regards.
2808	Sara
2809	JP Morgan is sending the execution copy.
2810	Here's the list!
2811	Rex and Jim: By this time, I'm sure Clint has spoken with you about the ENE puts.
2811	I am reviewing the proposed language and will advise of any comments.
2812	The time works fine.
2812	Will Justin initiate the call?
2813	How does the attached work for the BOFC/NDF?
2813	I am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the EOL deal.
2814	Hey, Jason: Hope you're doing alright.
2814	I received a call from NY and before I called back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.
2814	It seems that you were going to send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was only one issue).
2814	Please let me know if this was ever done.
2814	Thanks.
2814	On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter (adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.
2814	The child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam didn't see her.
2814	Did you really get to know Samantha?
2814	If so, and if you would like her home address, please let me know.
2815	Serge: Sorry to take so long to respond.
2815	A few things: (1) What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?
2815	Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?
2815	(2) There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit goup to react.
2815	I'll broach the topic again when I hear from you.
2815	Please let me know if you have any other questions.
2816	Maria: I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a "position letter" to you when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.
2816	Absent that information, it appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate fallback).
2816	We cannot agree to your request.
2816	The last database entry I reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your response.
2816	Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the status.
2816	Please let me know what you would like to do.
2817	I'm working on the schedule.
2817	Please confirm whether Washington (which airport) is closer to ;you.
2817	Also, how difficult is it to get from the Baltimore ariport to you?
2817	I'll let you know soon.
2817	Mike will not be coming with me.
2817	Sara
2818	Greg: Per my voice mail, please see the list below.
2818	It is not specific enough for Susan Musch and I to identify potential counterparties.
2818	I look forward to hearing from you.
2818	Thanks.
2819	I left a voice mail for Greg Johnston and have not heard back.
2819	Stuart, can you reach Greg?
2820	Have you checked with credit?
2821	Cheryl: Let's keep the 1:30 scheduled meeting on Wednesday to discuss brokerage items.
2821	Would you please forward to me the updated list.
2821	In addition to the existing agreements, we need to discuss electronic trading platform reviews (based upon the Haedicke memo).
2822	Marcelo: I've tried to comment to your blackline of 3/2/01.
2822	You may need to call me to sort through the last few changes.
2823	OK, Cheryl, you thought I was kidding about needing the guaranty!
2823	Can we request the new guaranty now?
2824	Please review the attached language which was drafted to conform to the two (2) EOL BOFC par forward products.
2825	Martin: How are things going?
2825	In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies of external lawfirm memoranda.
2825	Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form to provide for the "eligible contract participant" rep and line of business.
2825	I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted to ECTRIC.
2825	Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would lilke to see regarding the new legislation.
2825	Please note that the act is very broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC "know-it alls") and addresses many types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.
2825	Will you be in San Antonio?
2826	Anna: I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI account.
2826	I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.
2826	Can we execute the ECI agreement today?
2826	Have we agreed on the assignment?
2826	Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities Loan Agreement?
2826	Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already requested.
2826	I'll check on the expedited delivery date.
2826	Please call me when you receive this email.
2826	Thanks very much for your attention to this matter.
2827	Tom: Which accounts are being transferred to Bear?
2827	Are these internal account numbers?
2827	Thanks
2828	Martin: further to my earlier email, the U.S. changes (relating to the Act) were previously sent to the attention of Mark Evans for the appropriate distribution.
2829	FYI
2830	Enron North America Corp. will be the contracting party.
2830	For your information, Enron Corp. is the parent.
2830	The street address is listed below (the "EB" number is my location).
2830	Please call me in the a.m. for other questions you may have.
2831	Hi, Linda and Sharon: Please let me know if Russell sent revised worksheets to you guys.
2831	I left a message for him a few minutes ago.
2831	I know he goes on vacation Thursday.
2831	Thanks.
2832	Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer agreement and assignment (from ENA) of the Securities Loan Agreement/credit book.
2832	I am not certain if Cheryl was able to expedite delivery of the new ENE guaranty.
2833	Susan: Are you the "someone" who will prepare execution copies?
2833	Strange.
2834	Susan: Put this on your list (it is not urgent).
2834	Please send to Martin Rosell or advise him of the location of ENA's revised ISDA Schedule.
2834	Thanks.
2835	Bob: Thanks for the update.
2835	No need to call back but here are my comments: Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since this is also one of Sam's items City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") - neither of these are on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.
2835	Ed Quinn is leaving Enron Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
2836	Linda: Carol St. Clair is one of the Houston lawyers handling Canadian matters.
2836	She will speak with Russell this morning about revising the credit worksheets and will be available to answer questions.
2836	Her extension is 33989.
2836	Also, as Tana mentioned in her email yesterday, both Susan Bailey and Stephanie Panus are the paralegals in Houston who create the omnibus confirms having credit and you should always feel free to contact them.
2836	P.S.
2836	Russell is going on vacation this week and I don't know who will handle Canadian credit issues in his absence.
2837	With respect to Enron Credit Ltd., please note that ENA has and executed master with FUNB.
2837	Let Susan Bailey know if you need a copy of the agreement.
2838	Ken: Good idea!
2838	Carol St. Clair is handling this agreement.
2838	Please give her a call at X33989.
2839	(1) The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan Agreement.
2839	(2) Remember, ENA is also assigning the "credit book" (identified in Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).
2840	Sheila and Tom need to know the status.
2840	Please advise them mid-day.
2841	Hey, DUDE!
2841	Have you forgotten to read your Lotus Notes today?
2841	Looks like this one filtered through lots of people (since you left, multiple people fill your shoes).
2841	And where did you hear it was nice over in Houston?
2841	It's raining with a high of 54 F. But it is supposed to reach mid-70's over the weekend.
2841	I'll ask Susan B. to send you a copy.
2841	Stay tuned for the mad cow email.
2842	Not urgent.
2842	Rod Nelson would like a copy of the FUNB Schedule/CSA.
2842	He'll be doing the Enron Credit Ltd. master.
2842	Thanks.
2843	Thanks so much.
2844	Corinne: Just checking to see if you had sent execution copies of the agreement.
2844	I spoke with Mike Schneider last week to verify our acceptance of the rate schedule.
2844	Please let me know when we can execute - my traders are calling!
2844	Thanks.
2845	Attached are the final blacklines for the seasonal and daily FX products.
2845	Also, we can discuss Justin's latest description.
2846	Corinne: Please ignore the earlier message.
2846	See below.
2846	Thanks.
2847	Stewart: Per your voice mail, I have not yet received any credit from Tracy and, consequently, have not sent a master to the WAPA lawyer.
2847	Do you want me to send a "sample governmental master agreement" which would not be tailored
2848	All: Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.
2848	The legal terminology is identical for each product.
2848	However, Stuart needs to provide a title for each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.
2848	The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.
2848	Justin: Will you circulate the revised long description (since your conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?
2848	Also, will you let us all know when we are competely done?
2848	Please call with comments as soon as possible.
2849	Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem.
2849	In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.
2849	Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.
2849	Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties.
2849	Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.
2850	Tracy: The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.
2850	I am waiting with the firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to whom and where to send (via email).
2850	I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate at Allegheny and Lauren at Sullivan and Cromwell.
2850	Can you exert some pressure here?
2851	Hi, Lauren: I cannot find the new email address for the Allegheny lawyer for delivery of a revised ISDA Schedule.
2851	I left a voice mail for Yair Yaish and for Laurie but have not heard back.
2851	Can you provide me with the latest information?
2851	Are you the lawyer who should receive this Schedule?
2851	Please let me hear from you.
2851	Thanks.
2852	Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of 3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
2852	I have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side letter agreement."
2852	Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to finalize by April 6.
2852	Thanks.
2853	Paul: Carol will handle the hedge funds.
2853	Thanks.
2854	Tracy: Lauren called me and I was able to reach Yair.
2854	Thanks.
2855	Susan: Just a reminder that our meeting is at 10:00 am on Wednesday, 38C1.
2855	Please confirm that you will be able to attend and speak to us re: tax issues for derivatives.
2855	I am glad to assist in any way.
2855	Thanks.
2856	Russ and Richard: The referenced agreement was sent to you for execution on December 7, 2000.
2856	We have never received an executed original of the agreement or the guaranty from Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. We have called on several occasions to locate these instruments.
2856	Please let us know if there is a problem.
2857	FYI
2858	Jorge: You sent Annex 1 which I already have.
2858	I'd like to see Annex II which you reference in Paragraph 4 of your confirmation.
2859	Cheryl: Per my voice mail.
2860	Cheryl: Attached are a series of messages regarding the Enron Credit Inc. slate of officers.
2860	This has been going on for some time.
2861	Cheryl: 1.
2861	& 3.
2861	You should verify wtih Cheryl Lewis whose information is in Lotus Notes.
2861	I do not have correct spelling of name or her fax number.
2861	2.
2861	Officers need to be confirmed through the Enron Corp. corporate secretary's office.
2861	See the separate email I just sent you.
2862	Melba: It looks fine.
2862	Do you remove the footer from the document when it goes online?
2863	Jorge: I may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some things for me.
2863	Where are your definitions of "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified Calculation Period"?
2863	In your definition of "IPA Floating Rate Payment", you use the term "Share Spread" which is not defined.
2863	What do you mean?
2863	There is a dangling definition of "Share Spread" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II.
2863	In the "IPA Compensation" section, how is "a negative IPA elected"?
2863	Who is making an election?
2863	Let's discuss tomorrow.
2864	Tanya: Carol and I would like to meet with you tomorrow (Wed.) at 11 am.
2864	The credit worksheet would be a very timely issue for us.
2864	Does the time work for you?
2865	George: 1.
2865	You didn't answer my question about "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified Calculation Period".
2865	2.
2865	Are you saying that EEL "elects" to increase/decrease the Basket Component Shares?
2865	Are you saying that the "IPA Number of Shares" is negative or the IPA is negative?
2865	Is the IPA negative when the Initial Price exceeds the Relevant Price?
2866	Mark your calendar.
2867	Laurel: Does Jorge have a background in equity swaps?
2868	Cheryl: 1.
2868	Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.
2868	2.
2868	No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were essential.
2868	I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.
2868	I suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.
2868	Often, the broker will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs.
2868	This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.
2869	ours
2870	Cheryl: Glad you got the info!
2870	Let me know if you need anything further.
2871	Yes, I did, but I had an error in your email address that I didn't correct.
2871	Do we need to do something about that?
2871	Are you supposed to receive information?
2872	Let's send out this in the morning (if possible).
2872	Is the worksheet attached?
2872	I couldn't access it.
2872	We'll need address into from John Malowney (Portland) if Wendy doesn't have it.
2873	Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.
2873	I have no meetings scheduled with you tomorrow.
2873	I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.
2873	The brokerage meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring ourselves up to date (and we met last week).
2873	The swap group meeting is always held twice monthly.
2873	Hope this helps.
2874	Cheryl: I think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings just to stay abreast of activity and expectations.
2874	Why don't we keep the end of month meetings?
2874	I'll resend the schedule to you.
2875	FYI
2876	I'm reviewing the draft now.
2876	Who do we send this draft to?
2876	Do we have an email address?
2876	Let me know.
2877	All: Attached for your convenience is the CWT memo.
2878	Paul: Cheryl Nelson (X54693) is our new lawyer handling brokerage agreements.
2878	She has the Trading Edge file and can review the outstanding issues wtih you.
2878	Please give her a call in the morning.
2878	Thanks.
2879	Tanya: You were going to let me know about the cross default for the two swaps.
2879	Thanks.
2880	Hi, Michael: Per my voice mail, I am interested in purchasing a case of Skewis half-bottles (any vineyard).
2880	Do you have 12 bottles available?
2880	That is my first request.
2880	If you don't have 12 Skewis, then I may have to search for alternatives.
2880	Shipment for this case will be directly to: New Orleans, LA 70130 We can discuss payment when I hear from you.
2880	Thanks for your help.
2880	Please respond to "Michael Rapp"
2881	Thanks.
2881	I'll try to get to this tonight or in the morning.
2882	Kim: Attached are my comments.
2883	John: If Stephanie was unable to send today, she (or I) will do it in the a.m. Unfortunately, she is the only paralegal in the office right now.
2883	Thanks for your patience.
2884	When you have a chance
2885	Kim: Anytime this afternoon or tomorrow (before noon) is fine.
2886	Frank: Can you handle?
2887	Dee: Hope you had a good vacation.
2887	I sent a copy of the Enron North America Corp. ISDA Schedule/CSA to Rod Nelson who is the credit person in London reviewing credit for ECL.
2887	Rod can be reached at 011-44-20-7783-5275, I need to send the Enron Corp. Schedule to you.
2888	All: Effective March 19, 2001, AESC and ENA entered into a "Side Letter Agreement" which is an ISDA Master Agreement from a legal perspective.
2888	ENA and AESC have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master Agreement by April 13, 2001.
2888	Until that date, however, we can confirm financial trades between ENA and AESC under the Side Letter Agreement.
2888	Attached below is a markup of an ISDA form of confirmation which contains language for these confirmations (the draft was prepared for Kim Hundl handling financial power).
2888	Please let me know if you have any questions.
2889	Kim: It looks fine, and, you should use this format until the ISDA is executed.
2889	We spoke with Allegheny this morning and they promise to execute next week.
2890	Diane: Attached is a blackline for the first deal (but you should use the language for both deals).
2890	Let me know if you have any questions.
2891	Cheryl: Just a bit of history: I think that the partial listing of officers on the (authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate officers and directors.
2891	The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company is the authority for document execution.
2891	If, for example, a VP is authorized to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the partial listing, exection is not invalidated.
2891	The execution is valid.
2891	Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?
2892	Stephanie: AESC and Enron North America Corp. have an executed master agreement currently in the form of a "side letter ISDA agreement" which is enforceable and sufficient to permit online financial trading for gas and power.
2893	I have no preferance but it looks like the 24th is best.
2894	each period from ,and including, one Valuation Date to, but excluding the next following applicable Valuation Date during the Term of the Transaction, except that (a) the initial Calculation Period will commence on, and include, January 17, 2001 and (b) the final Calculation Period will end on, but exclude, the Termination Date.
2895	Approved for LPG EOL trading (with Tom Moran credit approval).
2896	Hi, Michael - hope all is well.
2896	Just curious if London might be interested in a George Washington University MBA (International Business) looking for work in London or Europe.
2896	She is a family friend.
2896	She is bilingual (Swedish and English) and fluent in French and German.
2896	She also has work experience.
2896	I am going to send her resume to HR in Houston and suggest her for the analyst/associate program.
2896	However, I wasn't certain as to whether the London/European offices worked through a different processs.
2896	Please let me know if you think there may be some interest.
2897	Has anyone handled?
2898	No, thanks.
2898	I'll wait for Cheryl's review.
2899	thanks.
2899	I only asked Keegan for the most recent version since I misplaced it.
2899	She misread my message.
2899	In any event, I told her I'd wait for the updated version.
2899	Also, you know Stephanie is on vacation this week.
2900	Ed: Further to my voice mail of earlier today, the CI guaranty appears to be limited in duration but there is not a specific term.
2900	How long must the guaranty remain effective?
2901	Mara: Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both the Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
2901	Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill, Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement.
2901	Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.
2901	Let's try to agree to everything this week.
2901	Thanks.
2902	Ed: For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear?
2903	Tanya: Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in the Schedule (as an "Additional Event of Default") with respect to the disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based on your usage in power masters?
2903	I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to trigger the MAC.
2903	For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the question to credit?
2904	Mark: When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing "training" and balancing workloads.
2904	Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) since Carol does not have time for either.
2904	Angela has no time for equity deals.
2904	I think we need a backup for each.
2904	Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the bill.
2904	Or Cheryl.
2904	Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience.
2904	I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload.
2904	This could turn into a "Yao long term project."
2905	Per my voice mail.
2906	SECOND REQUEST Russ and Richard: I have never had a response from anyone at Lehman about my prior attached message.
2906	Will one of you please call me?
2907	Yes, "eligible contract participant" ("ECP") is an issue.
2907	Both ENA and ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with oversight for derivatives).
2907	As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI does have many executed ISDA agreements.
2907	I do not know the volume of "omnibus" trades.
2907	However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations in the annex.
2908	Kristina: Please call me at work (713-853-5620) or at home (713-664-3207).
2908	I have some information for you.
2909	I believe Frank is handling.
2909	Is there a problem?
2909	I approved them for LPG online last Friday (I think Tom Moran handled from credit).
2910	Holli: EWEB's Board Resolution of December 5, 2000 permits financial hedging in general and authorizes: "The General Manager or other authorized officers as noted in the Power Risk Management Guidelines to execute confirmations of transactions within the limits specified in the Power Risk Management Guidelines."
2910	Each time ENA trades with EWEB, the trader must verify whether the EWEB trader is authorized under the then current version of the Power Risk Management Guidelines.
2910	Each date you execute a trade: (1) you will need a list of authorized traders (authorized to enter into derivative transactions) certified by EWEB's secretary to be correct as of the Trade Date and (2) a statement certified by EWEB's secretary that the Transaction falls within the limits specified in the most current version of the Power Risk Management Guidelines, effective as of the Trade Date.
2910	We have only a portion of the Power Risk Management Guidelines and it is dated April 19, 1999.
2910	Our version is incomplete and probably outdated.
2910	Maybe EWEB will provide you with the current version.
2910	It would be a lot easier if EWEB's resolution simply authorized it to enter into financial trades documented under the ISDA (which is what most resolutions permit).
2910	However, EWEB did not obtain a broad resolution.
2910	To Melissa, Sharen and Kim: We should also verify that our confirmations contain these representations.
2910	Please talk to me.
2911	FYI
2912	I don't understand your message.
2912	Parties must be "eligible" at the time each Transaction is entered into.
2913	I'm running behind and will try to review first thing in the a.m.
2914	Please find out if Cheryl wants to cancel the brokerage meeting tomorrow.
2914	It's fine with me.
2915	Kaye: Can you please email the prior report to me?
2915	Thanks.
2916	Jorge: The attached confirmation looks fine.
2916	However, you did not attach Annex II which is referenced all over the confirmation.
2916	For future reference, "Calculation Period(s)" should be used for multiple periods.
2917	Tanya: Once again, we need a master for Pushkar's FX trading.
2917	The counterparty's name is: I am constantly receiving calls for this agreement.
2917	Please asssign.
2917	Thanks.
2918	Not yet.
2918	Please send final version of Annex II.
2919	Cheryl: We'll email the draft ISDA Schedule and CSA to you and Chuck.
2919	Please email me back with address, phone, email, etc. information as to how you would like the drafts sent.
2919	Thanks.
2920	Does anyone have this file?
2921	Janie: I prepared a format last week for Allegheny for use until the ISDA Master Agreement is executed.
2921	Let me know if you have any questions.
2922	Bob: Have you followed up with this company?
2922	If not, please do and let us know (in Lotus Notes).
2922	Thanks.
2923	Just a head's up on NUI - I'll let you know when I hear from Stacy.
2924	I am interested in parking in the Enron Center Garage.
2924	Please advise of availability.
2925	Please prepare a new ISDA.
2925	I'm waiting for instructions from the counterparty as to distribution.
2926	Attached is my redline.
2926	Call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues, including: (1) Calculation Agent.
2926	We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is adequate.
2926	(2) Procedures for Entering into Transactions.
2926	There is no procedure for dual confirms.
2926	This is too confusing.
2926	(3) Transfer.
2926	We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too subjective.
2926	The other changes were not substantive.
2927	Diane: Attached are my revisions to the form of confirmation (which are NOT on the actual confirms you will be using).
2927	You will need to incorporate the section entitled "Additional Provisions" and you will also need to add the Exhibit A guaranty.
2927	Please let me (and Mark Beese) review before this is sent.
2927	Please call if you have questions.l
2928	Susan: This is for the ING master.
2928	We need to email to Cheryl and her colleagues.
2929	Susan: more info for ING to add to Lotus Notes.
2930	I would like to attend.
2931	Cheryl: Can you please forward a copy of the ECI resolution(s) (or consent) which was used to establish the Bear account and Securites Loan Agreement?
2931	We need to determine all products authorized for ECI trading.
2931	Also, copies of Enron Credit Limited authorizations would be useful.
2931	Thanks for your help.
2932	It's a good thing you didn't try to get back to me!
2932	Sorrry.
2933	Bob: (1) got a vm from Carol and she really needs the EES C.A.
2933	- I know she left you a vm (2) surprise!
2933	I just received an email from Cargill asking about none other than setoff Part (b)!
2933	Let me know what you find out.
2934	Cheryl: All resolutions and consents for Enron companies subject to oversight by our group must be approved by Mark Taylor.
2935	Mike: At Janelle's request, please find attached Enron North America Corp.'s orignial draft of the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13 prepared for you earlier this year.
2936	Ed: In case you are wondering about Cargill-Alliant.
2937	Diane: Looks like the guarantor will have to change to: NUI Corp. (and replace NUI Utilities, Inc.) This will require changes to the "Additional Provisions" section, part (b) and the Exhibit A. We will target Monday morning to finalize.
2937	Thanks.
2938	Dick: Attached are my comments to the certificates.
2938	We will need to attach the form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is authorized.
2938	Let me know if you have any questions.
2938	Thanks.
2939	Sent for execution on April 6.
2939	Aneela called JP to hurry them along for final docs.
2939	You may need to call them as we've not received account information.
2940	Tracy: Please read Yair's message and let me know asap.
2940	It appears from his email that this is the only remaining issue.
2940	I'm in today until about 3 pm Houston.
2941	I've left a message with Tracy Ngo (in Portland) and will let you know as soon as I hear from her.
2941	How long will you be in the office today?
2942	Stephanie: please note below.
2943	Ellen: I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.).
2943	Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap: (1) March 28, 2011 is the "Break Date" or "Early Termination Date".
2943	(2) Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.
2943	By the way, this is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later disputed by the other party.
2943	(3) The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date. (4) Payment will occur on the Break Date. (5) I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date. There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to resolve. (6) If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business Days before the Break Date. The confirm describes how the quotes are averaged. A minimum of 3 quotes is essential. Payment is still made on the Break Date. George: (1) Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11. My copy is a little fuzzy and the date could actually be 3/26/11. (2) I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you. Please note that: (a) the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 Definitions "as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time" (i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions). There is a problem if WestLB disagrees because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 "as is" since it is based upon the 2000 ISDA Definitions. (b) no need to say that the Calculation Agent is "as otherwise stated in the Agreement" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the Agreement.
2944	I'll call in a few
2945	Tanya: After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following: (1) Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".
2945	Should this remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?
2945	(2) Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the list so I say let's forget it.
2945	No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.
2945	Further, she cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.
2945	Please let me know what you would like to do.
2946	All: (1) Joe and I have reviewed the Termination Agreement for Mercado and it looks fine.
2946	(2) I suggest that the following language be added to the bottom of a revised invoice (revised because the comment section which indicates the NF1164.Y is an annuity completed on 04/11/01 is inaccurate): Mercado Gas Services, Inc. acknowledges that payment for Deal No. NF1164.Y is made in partial consideration of that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of April 5, 2001 by and among Mercado Gas Services, Inc., Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company and Enron North America Corp. MERCADO GAS SERVICES, INC. By: _________________________ Name: ______________________ Title: ________________________ (3) Joe and I have the following questions: (a) If the assignment to Williams was effective 4/5/01, why are we looking at figures from 4/9/01 and 4/11/01, respectively?
2946	(b) In lieu of (a) above, have ENA and Mercado already agreed to the numbers appearing on the invoice?
2947	Tracy, how is this: Regarding the "Transfer" language for Allegheny (Party B), we have the following proposal: "Party B may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate provided that (1) such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default, and (2) (i) the creditworthiness of the Affiliate is not materially weaker than that of Party B immediately prior to such transfer, unless Party B provides a satisfactory guaranty or credit support to the Affiliate, or (ii) the proposed Affiliate satisfies the criteria that Party A applies in deciding whether to offer or make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the Transactions subject to the proposed transfer."
2948	Tracy has agreed to the language below which would be added as (d) to the "Transfer" section:
2949	Mark: I have changed my vacation to the week of May 7 - 11 rather than the following week.
2950	Tom: I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of transactions.
2950	However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, then we need not worry.
2950	I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman person.
2951	Sorry, but the invitation asked for reply by April 20.
2951	I have emailed the Feinbergs of my acceptance.
2952	Yes, I will attend (one person).
2952	Thank you.
2953	I will as soon as I determine vacation plans.
2954	Sure.
2954	I think we should ask Paul R. if anyone else from credit is necessary (London, perhaps?) and from legal, you, Brent and me.
2954	Also, we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set.
2954	I will be on vacation during the week of May 7 - 11.
2954	Were you able to put a list together?
2955	Yes, it's being handled.
2955	Thanks.
2956	FYI - I am reviewing
2957	Gail: Attached is a form of ECI unanimous consent.
2957	Will you accept fhis for the purpose of signing a repo agreement and transacting thereunder?
2957	Please let me know.
2957	Also, you can email repo documents to me.
2957	Thanks.
2958	Carol: (1) see Tanya's note re: Occidental (2) I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try to find).
2958	Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.
2958	(3) I don't have strong feelings about the offsite - but I'd vote for the a.m. rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite.
2959	LDNGC Series 1998 A Trust
2960	Tom: I forwarded a copy of the ECI unanimous consent to Goldman to see if they will accept "as is".
2960	I have not heard back.
2960	Goldman legal will email repo docs.
2960	Regarding Enron Credit Limited ("ECL"), I spoke with Goldman commercial and understand that someone (don't know who) from London ECL contacted Goldman inquiring about repos.
2960	I'm happy to facilitate with contacts, etc. so please let me know.
2961	Carol: I can't recall if we discussed but this was one CP discussed at out last legal/credit meeting.
2961	We should update at next meeting.
2962	How can I get in touch with Derek Lee?
2963	Gail: The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a repo agreement.
2963	If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory, please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific consent.
2963	Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.
2963	I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.
2963	That entity should have its own form of unanimous consent or resolution.
2963	Thanks for your help.
2964	The prior trading dispute resulted from a plastics deal and Doug Friedman was the trader.
2964	I would check with Doug.
2965	Jim and Rex: The Lehman Bros. form of "put" works fine from a legal perspective.
2965	Yesterday, I faxed to you one of the "puts" with underlined language reflecting differences in securities language from our prior swap/forward deals with Lehman.
2965	The differences may be alright for purposes of the "puts".
2965	Please let Jeff know if the "puts" are acceptable for execution (from the securities perspective).
2965	I have already initialed the documents from the swap perspective.
2965	Let me know if you have any questions.
2965	As usual, thanks for your help.
2966	Hey, you and I think alike (being that we were raised by the same GAM&D crew).
2966	Lawyer Burlingame was unavailable when I called to wish him the best, and of course, he has no email address.
2966	Maybe a joint belated call tomorrow?
2966	Please respond to pkdaigle
2967	Attached is a draft doc (I didn't change the Schedule yet) which we can discuss in the a.m. I apologize in advance for errors/misunderstandings but this can be easily rectified.
2968	Did you speak with your ECTRIC credit counterpart?
2968	Who is it?
2968	Did he make this inquiry already?
2968	One of you needs to speak wtih Total.
2968	The "due diligence" issue is a credit responsibility.
2968	Please let us know how we can help.
2969	Michael: Attached is a revised blackline of the Enron Corp. guaranty for your review.
2969	Please let us have your comments.
2970	Dick: I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee" certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").
2970	If we leave the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.
2970	Please let me know if you are alright with this change.
2970	If so, we ask that you please resend the certificate dated April 12, 2001.
2970	If you do not wish to make the change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit "A" is attached.
2970	Please call if you have any questions.
2970	Thanks.
2971	Janelle: I'm not sure if this is what you want but take a look.
2971	I opted to not use "call", "strike", etc. language but feel free to edit.
2971	I am in a meeting until 3:30 but you can reach me through my assistant Kaye Ellis (X35968).
2972	Can't recall if I asked you to reassign to another paralegal.
2972	Please let me know.
2972	Thanks.
2973	Tanya: Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.
2973	Sounds like he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) and Enron Industrial Markets ("EIM").
2973	In the end, EIM was not the correct party but the Canadian party was the correct party.
2973	Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by credit?
2973	Is the company eligible?
2973	Please let me know what you think.
2973	Thanks.
2974	Mary: Can you assign Susan to this one since she's already working on the omnibus and revising a prior trade?
2975	Yair: Are we finished?
2975	Please let me know.
2975	Thanks.
2976	Hi, Matthew, sorry for the late response but I am the right person for receipt of your inquiry.
2976	Please advise what products we will trade.
2976	Thanks very much.
2976	Please respond to Matthew.Flett
2977	Frank: Please refresh my geriatric mind!
2977	Are you handling this one?
2978	Tracy: Can you call me and let's get Yair on the phone so that we can finalize Allegheny?
2978	Thanks.
2978	P.S.
2978	Did you hear that Janice is moving back to VA?
2979	All: I received a draft master agreement from MSCS for proposed execution with Enron North America Corp. Are any of you trying to push execution of this agreement?
2979	Have either of Enron Credit, Inc. or Enron Credit Limited been speaking with MSCS about this?
2979	Please advise.
2979	Thanks.
2980	Tanya: For purposes of "Transfer", shall we permit both parties to transfer to Affiliates?
2980	Would FUNB require a guaranty?
2980	Or do we feel strongly that neither party should have the ability to transfer except with the written consent of the other party?
2981	Yes, I'm available.
2981	What time works for you?
2981	I'd rather go after 111:45.
2982	Tom: Thanks for the info.
2982	I did not receive anything from you yesterday (Wed., April18).
2982	Please update.
2982	Thanks.
2983	See ya in el lobbyo at noon
2984	Mara: (1) The second setoff paragraph is intended to allow the Non-defaulting party to withhold payment if is not paid amounts that, for whatever reason, do not qualify for setoff.
2984	(2) My credit group is calling to inquire about the delay.
2984	Can you elaborate further or better yet, ask Andrzej to contact Ed Sacks?
2984	Thanks.
2984	(3) Can we finalize the agreement even though we have not concluded the guaranties?
2984	Thanks.
2985	Thanks.
2985	We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.
2985	We are trying to have the guaranty executed.
2985	Stephanie: We will ultimately need to attach the "Clement approved" form of guaranty to the Confirmation.
2985	Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in the amendment to the first transaction.
2986	Stephanie: The attached message is only for the email address.
2986	Please send the Annex B/B-1 blackline for ConEd to Michael Forte (email below) and Janelle Scheuer.
2986	I'm looking at the amendment now.
2986	Thanks so much.
2987	Carson: I'm on the phone with Donna and due to our extremely busy schedules we have penciled in May 16 as D-Day (you know, "dinner date").
2987	After the Enron legal conference, I'm on vacation which is the reason for the May date.
2987	Before the Enron legal conference, Donna is out of town most of the time.
2987	So - please let us hear from you.
2987	Did you remember Monty's birthday?
2988	Caroline: Please give me a call when you're off the phone.
2988	Thanks.
2989	April 17
2990	Paul: Were you going to send me a worksheet or email?
2990	Given that this is a long term deal, do you want to set a deadline for negotiating an ISDA (and make it an event of default)?
2991	Carol: Regarding a "hedge fund meeting" next week, I have spoken with most of the likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.
2991	I'll fill you in on details in person.
2991	I think the following people should attend: Fred Lagrasta Caroline Abramo Robyn Zivic Russell Dyk you Brent me I believe that we have a mushrooming "process" issue.
2991	I also believe that the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).
2991	My observations are that all hedge funds need not be "last minute" deals, Caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner.
2991	I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.
2991	Afternoon is best.
2991	Shall I schedule or have you already begun?
2992	Gail: Is the attached Master Repurchase Agreement used by both GS&Co as well as GSI?
2992	It looks like both Enron companies (U.S and U.K.) will want repos and the U.S. company .
2992	What is the difference in the forms used by GS&Co and GSI?
2992	Any word on the consent?
2992	Thanks.
2993	Matthew: In conjunction with our negotiation of an ISDA, I thought I'd mention that we may also need a repo agreement for non-U.S. bonds.
2993	I don't know which Morgan entity would be the appropriate party.
2993	Would you please advise and forward documentation.
2993	Thanks.
2994	Thanks.
2994	Any word on the consent?
2995	GS&Co and GSI have different repo agreements and these are generated from different offices.
2995	I have been placed in touch with the London lawyer who handles GSI.
2995	Tom: I have asked again about the form of ECI consent.
2996	Kaye: Please reschedule the meeting for an afternoon meeting (best after 3 pm Houston) to include the following people: Fred Lagrasta Paul Radous Caroline Abramo (NY - she can be available by phone) Robyn Zivic Russ Dyk Carol Brent me
2997	Anna: I would like to fax the resume of Kristina Fisher to you (I do not have a word version to email).
2997	She is the candidate about whom we spoke recently.
2997	I have also asked Kristina to visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and apply through that process.
2997	I assume that you are the person who receives inquiries on the website.
2997	Please advise me of your fax number and I can send the resume directly to you.
2997	Thanks so much for your interest.
2998	attached is a sample option - please remove footnotes
2999	Jay and Wendy: I haven't heard back from Tracy about the Transfer issue.
2999	Can you answer the question instead of Tracy?
2999	I think this is the only issue before we sign the
3000	Tanya: Our FX/currency traders in London need an ISDA with MSCI.
3000	Rod prepared a credit work sheet on 6/16/00.
3000	The negotiations never went anywhere.
3000	MSCI has now sent their form of agreement.
3000	Do you want to propose new credit or use the existing credit from last year?
3001	Hi, Kristina: It was great speaking with you last night!
3001	Hope your dad is home and doing well.
3001	I have contacted two different offices within Enron.
3001	The first is Human Resources in Houston.
3001	I suggested to them that you might be a good candidate for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as well.
3001	I don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know.
3001	The second "office" is directly to London.
3001	There is a woman in London named Anna Jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst program in the Eastern Hemisphere.
3001	I have spoken with Anna and she has asked that you visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and apply through the site.
3001	She already knows your name and I am trying to fax your resume (business resume) to her as well.
3001	When you visit the site, you may decide to use a different resume; just let me know.
3001	Just in case you would like to call directly, Anna's number in London (dialed from the U.S.) is 011-44-20-7783-5912.
3001	The company directory shows her email address as "anna_jansson@enron.net" (which looks a little weird to me).
3001	Please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses (or don't hear back) so that I can follow up internally.
3001	By the way, you have an impressive resume.
3001	Please feel free to call me at anytime.
3001	I hope we get to meet soon.
3002	Kaye: Without making this too complicated, Frank Sayre wants to join in. And I am waiting to hear when Caroline Abramo will be in Houston.
3002	Thursday and Friday are not acceptable dates.
3002	Please call me Monday morning.
3002	Thanks.
3002	p.s.
3002	The essential invitees are Fred, Paul, Caroline and either Carol or me.
3003	Caroline: Fred wants to meet in the afternoon.
3003	Does Tuesday afternoon work for you (after 3 pm)?
3004	We will keep the 10 am meeting on Tuesday, April 24, EB 38C2 (legal and credit only).
3004	We will also schedule a meeting at 3 pm (same day after legal/credit regular meeting) with Fred, Caroline, Russell Dyk and Robyn Zivic.
3004	Fred could not meet in the morning and he is an integral part of the process we are trying to develop for hedge funds.
3004	I apologize if all of the lawyers cannot meet at 3 pm but at least one lawyer in attendance should keep us on track.
3005	Fred cannot meet at 10 am Tuesday morning.
3005	We will meet at 3pm Tuesday, location TBD.
3006	Just spoke with Mark Russell.
3006	SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and credit.
3006	I told Mark that I was available Wed.
3006	and Thurs.
3006	morning.
3006	Are you guys available at the same time?
3006	Jay - please call me with your bond rating info so that I can email a draft agreement to SRP.
3007	Kim: Mark Russell asked what lawyer will handle the gas master physical.
3007	Have you spoken with a physical lawyer yet?
3008	(1) We're keeping the Tuesday, 10 am (no need to send any emails) (2) We're adding a Tuesday, 3 pm and we need a conference room.
3008	A message about the 3 pm should be sent to everyone in my earlier message.
3009	Is there any intention of selling off equity in this company?
3009	If so, in the near future?
3010	Caroline: I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now.
3010	You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems to be similar to AIG).
3010	This is all credit - but note his Additional Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.
3010	You must discuss all of the items with your counterparty.
3010	Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.
3011	Paul: With respect to Valentis: (a) Does the MAC apply to both S&P and Moody's?
3011	(not clear from worksheet) (b) Are the financial covenants Events of Default or Termination Events?
3011	(looks like these were Termination Events in AIG) (c) Is this deal two-way margining?
3011	You have set 0 Thresholds but indicated Return/Delivery for both parties.
3011	Our discussion of last week may have changed (we discussed one-way margining for CP only).
3011	I'll have the same questions for CD Holdings.
3012	Paul: Further to my earlier email: Do you want to request the language which we have devised for (1) hedge fund monthly account statements and (2) quarterly/annual engineering reserve reports?
3012	Please call to discuss.
3012	Caroline says she may be transacting today.
3013	Please add to your calendar.
3014	I received the referenced agreement in inter-office mail.
3014	According to Cheryl's latest report, identical agreements were executed by both ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on or about 4/12/01.
3014	What is it that you are asking us to do with the draft from "Jamie"?
3015	We need to call these guys.
3016	Here it is - I didn't prepare the "Annex 1" chart but it is noted
3017	I don't
3018	Anna: Could I please have your email address?
3018	Is it "anna.jansson@enron.com"?
3018	Also, are you interested in receiving Kristina Fisher's resume via facsimile?
3018	Regards
3019	Kristina: I thought her email address looked a little odd.
3019	Until I hear further, you might try: "anna.jansson@enron.com" I'll let you know if she answers my inquiry.
3019	Regards.
3020	Michael: I didn't receive a redraft of the confirm; did you?
3020	We are checking on the ENE guaranty and will let you know.
3021	Melissa: We agreed to the form of confirm with ConEd last night.
3021	Michael Forte was to send the redraft to Michael Brown.
3021	I haven't seen it yet.
3021	Sounds like there will be a plain vanilla swap also, which should look like (format) the one we did in January.
3022	Melissa: a spark spread is basis swap (gas/power spread) I found an old ENMAX confirm but I don't have a word version; I'm know we've done others possibly in draft format let me know if you have questions.
3023	Kim: When you have a minute, please call.
3023	Thanks.
3024	Chris: We should chat.
3024	Per the ISDA, ENA is the calc agent and we have already agreed to usual Market Disruption Events and fallbacks in the ISDA.
3024	If you want to change the ISDA agreement, then we can consider the items which Merchant has included in the draft.
3024	As calc agent, we should create a draft and send the form to you for review.
3024	However, I do need you to explain/verify Floating Price B. And verify rounding convention which differs from our standard.
3024	Please call to discuss.
3025	Stephanie: Let me know what you think about the ConEd comments.
3026	FYI
3027	Becky: Please send email to : Tell her (Maud Perrodin) that Brent received her document (it was an ISDA?) and could she please respond with the name of the commercial person(s) at Enron with whom she has been speaking.
3027	She is interested in weather trading.
3027	Please enter into Lotus Notes.
3028	I ordered a $75 flower arrangement for Kaye to be delivered today and signed all of our names.
3028	Sorry for not checking with each of you individually beforehand.
3028	If you would like to contribute, the cost will be $18.75 each.
3028	I'll absorb delivery.
3028	Thanks.
3029	Per my voice mail.
3029	We should put a draft together today for Chris to review.
3029	He will start giving Merchant Energy pricing today but will not transact until the end of the week.
3030	FYI
3031	I can't remember exactly - maybe $4000 - $5000 Sure looks like you like to pry!!!
3031	(just kidding, Carson) I've picked out a variety of wine for the 16th, by the way
3032	Melissa: I just got this but have not reviewed.
3032	Last night we only discussed the collar.
3032	You could look at their regular swap and compare it to the January swap (for form).
3032	I have meetings this afternnoon but will get back to you as soon as I can.
3032	Thanks for the spark spread draft which I will also review.
3033	Laurel: I have left messages with Rhett Jackson (RMT vs. ENA) and Brad Kirchhofer (why doesn't "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" show up on the corporate database).
3034	Tracy and I would like to discuss the "Transfer" issue with you tomorrow, if possible.
3034	We think this should be a short discussion (maybe 10 minutes).
3034	How is 1 pm NY time, tomorrow Wednesday April 25?
3034	This seems to be the most convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3 pm NY time.
3034	Would you please email your response?
3034	Thanks.
3035	Caroline: No Deemed ISDA, we decided that yesterday for the long-dated deal.
3035	We are working on the draft masters for emailing.
3035	Please send me the information about your counterparties' lawyers so we can begin negotiating.
3036	Tracy: It's fine with me.
3036	Let's schedule a time next week on Monday.
3036	The lawyers will be gone Wed - Fri next week.
3036	Name a time.
3037	Caroline: As you know, Carol is working on your template; then Frank, Carol and I will have to review/discuss.
3037	You will have the template soon.
3037	We are all working hard to provide you with the necessary documentation.
3037	Are you preparing the information for us?
3038	How about 11 am CST?
3038	I forgot that I have an 11:30 on Monday.
3039	I am unavailable Wed - Fri next week.
3039	We really need to discuss this and have the agreement executed.
3039	Tracy and I propose 12 pm EST (11 am CST and 9 am PST) on Monday, April 30.
3039	We believe this will be a very short discussion.
3039	Please reply to both of us.
3039	Thanks.
3040	Susan: We need to prepare materials this afternoon on these two hedge funds.
3040	The credit is different but the FORMS will be identical.
3040	Please let me know who will handle and I can discuss with that person nowl Thanks.
3041	Thanks for your help.
3041	I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that he worked on the transaction.
3041	The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.
3041	The only question is: Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and
3042	Susan: Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.
3042	The counterparty is a 100% owned Enron sub named "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona".
3042	When I last checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.
3042	However, I have verified the name, ownership, etc. with Jeff Blumenthal.
3042	I will separately email you the counterparty info that I have.
3042	We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.
3042	We should later do the ISDA when the information is available on the database (which could be any day, I suppose).
3042	I would just use our standard RMT format.
3042	Please assign.
3042	Feel free to call me or Laurel with questions.
3042	Thanks.
3043	In case no one told you, Brent is not in the office today.
3044	Please don't email to the parties below until we have a final conversation.
3045	Will Monday or Tuesday afternoon work for a short 1 hour "financial power" informal disucssion?
3045	Please let me know.
3045	Thank.s
3046	Paul: There is already a definition of "Liabilities" in the hedge fund template.
3046	We will enhance the existing definition to add the last phrase "...as would ...GAAP" and delete the "Liabilities" portion from your NAV definition.
3047	Is Maud Perrodin with Banque do Reescompte et de Placement?
3047	She told me it was Banque CPR.
3047	What is the letterhead?
3047	We need to add to Lotus Notes.
3047	Thanks.
3048	Any comments?
3049	Carol has seven (7) master swap agreements to be reassigned.
3049	Cheryl and I will work on these together.
3049	All appear on the legal/credit list.
3049	(1) Cross Timbers Oil Company (2) Camden Property Trust (3) Clorox Company (The) (4) Montana Power Comopany (The) (5) Ocean Energy, Inc. (6) Quebecor World USA, Inc. (7) Russel Metals Inc. Mary: Would you please reassign paralegals to Cross Timbers and Quebecor?
3049	These were handled by Samantha.
3049	Maybe Marie could assist; these don't appear to be urgent.
3049	Thanks.
3050	Sheila: Please send the futures and repo agreements to me.
3050	What futures products will Gary be trading and which exchanges?
3050	Please continue to send brokerage agreements to Cheryl.
3050	Thanks.
3051	Melissa: Merchant looks good.
3051	Please email to Chris.
3051	Also, thanks for your help with the omnibus forms.
3051	Anne Koehler is the new lawyer in our group and I'm sure she'll be calling you.
3052	Carol: Below is the list of items I'll be handling.
3052	You can send to me.
3053	Kaye: I'll give you my comments to the template and I ask that you please add these to the "clean" document.
3053	Thanks.
3054	Caroline: You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed yesterday evening per your instructions.
3054	I am still waiting for you to send information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.
3054	The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the hedge fund template which legal is refining.
3054	We are reviewing the first draft and commenting.
3054	FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.
3054	Also, the Enron legal conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 (afternoon) through May 4.
3054	And finally, I will be on vacation during the week of May 7 - May 11.
3054	Please try to make plans (conference calls, counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.
3054	Let me know if you have any questions.
3054	Thanks.
3055	Caroline: Your email is the first I've heard of Arthur Amron as legal counsel.
3055	Do you have his email address?
3055	Also, who are Marty Lifgren and Charles Davidson at Wexford who received our documents?
3055	Are these individuals traders?
3055	I will let you know who my backup will be.
3056	Sorry, Caroline.
3057	Mark: Can you "publish" a list of swap attorneys and their primary/secondary areas of responsibility (for at least the lawyers to use)?
3057	I'd like to direct random requests to the appropriate people.
3057	For example, is Brent the only "weather attorney"?
3058	Brent: It's a weather question.
3058	Looks like Carol asked Susan or Stephanie to let Celeste know if weather trades were possible (she thought it was).
3058	If weather is a commodity, I guess it works but you'd probably need to inocorporate ISDA terminology and your definitions, etc. Check the blue file - you'll see Carol's email.
3059	Celeste: I've asked Brent to give you a call.
3059	Thanks.
3060	Yair: Please let us know if we can conference as set forth in my earlier message.
3060	Thanks.
3061	Melissa: I started with Sempra.
3061	It's one of the more unusual masters ( a "Master Master" covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical "ECT Master".
3061	Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices provisions.
3061	We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.
3062	Edmund: Would you believe that we do not have a repo template?
3062	The repo requests are more infrequent than not.
3062	All are negotiated.
3062	Hope this helps.
3062	Regards.
3063	Marcelo: When we last spoke on April 3, you told me that the blacklined agreement would be sent in the next few days.
3063	Can you please provide me with an update?
3063	I would like to finalize/execute before May 2 when I will be on vacation.
3063	Please advise.
3063	Thank you.
3064	Carol: Have you had a chance to recap our "offsite" discussion?
3064	Also, what can you tell me about Montana Power Company (1st draft ISDA)?
3064	Stop by in the a.m regarding exercise of your swaption.
3064	What does your confirm say about the form of notice of exercise and the exercise date (or period)?
3065	Sheila: I want to send legal comments to SSB and Morgan Stanley today.
3065	Since I do not have the names of any lawyers, please verify that I should begin with: (1) SSB: Tania Meyer Wilson, VP Investments (2) Morgan: Joseph A. Marovich (his card was attached to the documents) Have you received anything from Goldman Sachs?
3066	No
3067	Kaye: Please print copies of the attached documents but I will need 2 copies of the first document.
3067	Thanks.
3068	Brant: refresh my memory, please.
3068	do we need to call Lee Jackson?
3069	I have two tickets (and parking!) for the Friday night (May 4) performance of "Dinner with Friends" which I cannot use.
3069	FREE!
3069	Please let me know if you are interested.
3070	Laurel: Did you hear back from Chase regarding the trades, fees, etc.?
3070	I have to call Genero back shortly.
3070	I can conference you in.
3071	I didn't recommend anyone since I am not familiar with the S&S lawyers who are handling the ISDA work.
3072	Jeff: Check the reps at the end of the confirm.
3072	Thanks.
3073	Thank you.
3074	Any response from Pushkar's dealer friends?
3075	Dick: I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.
3075	I had asked if you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to each trade confirmation.
3075	We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.
3075	This will be the format for all future transactions.
3075	Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.
3075	Her phone number is (713) 853-1647 and fax if (713) 646-2443.
3075	Thanks.
3076	Dick: That will be fine.
3076	However, you need to attach the trade confirmation (marked Exhibit "A") to each of your certificates since that is how each certificate is drafted.
3076	Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.
3076	Please call if you have any questions.
3076	Thanks for ;your assistance.
3077	Kim: Here's EWEB's response.
3077	I can't tell if they understand my point.
3078	Mark: FYI I've attached a list of projects I'm currently handling (in case you need while I'm on vacation).
3078	Please feel free to contact Kaye.
3079	Caroline: On April 25, you and your counterparties were provided with draft documentation (including the Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex).
3079	Did you read the documents?
3079	Are you asking for ISDA boilerplate?
3079	I will be here until noon.
3080	Susan and if she needs legal assistance, perhaps Cheryl.
3081	Deb: THIS IS TACKY!
3081	And, I haven't sent my gift yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3082	Kaye: Please verify phone number below and on my calendar for 5/16.
3083	Kristina: I'm sorry too!
3083	However, I also sent your application through Houston and it may end up with a different group.
3083	I'll keep my fingers crossed (not just for Enron) because I know you'll find an exciting position with a good company.
3083	Hope all is well.
3083	I just returned from a week in California and I'm having a hard time adjusting to the office.
3083	Regards.
3084	Tana and Kim: I'm not sure about the confusion regarding Allegheny confirmations but we have almost finalized the NEW ISDA.
3084	Kim: You'll recall the format from last month.
3084	Please let me know if either of you have questions.
3085	Do I need to do anything?
3086	Mary: Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate yourself.
3086	There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you had estabished a Raptor "format for termination", you decided to do the drafting.
3086	Let me know if there is a problem.
3087	Brent, can you bring me up to date, please?
3087	Just stop by.
3087	Thanks.
3087	P.S.
3087	Also, what's going on with Caroline Abramo and the hedge funds?
3088	Tracy: Did you and Yair finalize the "transfer" language?
3088	It seems that too many confirm questions are popping up and different forms are being drafted.
3088	We ;should be done with the ISDA.
3089	Laurel: I have a lot of time tomorrow (5/15) to discuss all related issues.
3089	I am attaching my most recent draft of the confirmation provisions for use in the EOL FX product confirmations.
3089	The first is for the Apr-Oct product and the second for the single day product.
3089	We need to compare the terminology against the EOL description.
3089	You will recall that this was based upon Stuart's preference for the CIBC format.
3090	Cheryl: Do you know anything about this?
3090	I don't.
3090	I am not aware that ENA or affiliates have ever engaged an Investment Advisor as that term is defined in the Investment Advisors Act.
3091	Justin: What lawyer handles daily financial trading issues?
3091	I need to speak with that person about US swap eligibility rules governing US companies, specifically, ECTRIC, and who evaluates ECTRIC's counterparties for eligibility.
3091	The specific issue has to do with Total as you will see from the string of emails attached.
3091	I look forward to hearing from you.
3091	Thanks.
3092	Celeste: Brent is looking into this for you.
3092	Thanks.
3093	FYI
3094	Tom: I assume your guaranty issues were resolved as I never heard back from you.
3094	Please advise.
3094	Thanks.
3095	John: The draft ISDA boilerplate and Schedule, Credit Support Annex, were sent via overnight delivery to Wayne Bowman, Air Liquide America Corp. on May 8, 2001.
3095	Cheryl Nelson (X54693) is the attorney working on the file.
3095	Let us know if you need us to contact the counterparty.
3096	Darren: I never received copies of the confirms which we discussed.
3097	Jay: We sent this master for execution on May 1, 2001 and the counterparty just responded to John with some comments.
3097	Only one comment is credit related: LPC does not want to pay default interest as per the ISDA agreement.
3097	LPC does not want interest compounded daily.
3097	What is your position?
3097	I have made all other changes or given LPC an explanation.
3098	Cheryl: I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.
3098	I'll let Tom know as soon as the amendment has been executed.
3098	Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a message with Sharon Chernick.
3098	In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. ("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the following documents: (1) assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a separate agreement with ECI executed?) (2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the amount of USD25 Million I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday of last week.
3098	Thanks.
3099	Ed: Will you please prepare a credit worksheet for Frontera?
3099	I don't know the complete name for this counterparty.
3099	Thanks.
3100	Sharon: I didn't have your phone or fax numbers to keep you in the loop so I am sending this email by way of explanation.
3100	You may recall that Anna Meytina and Cheryl Nelson negotiated one or more agreements between the Bear companies and Enron Credit Inc. These documents included the above referenced $25 Million guaranty.
3100	I understand that our respective commercial groups have agreed to an increased guaranty cap ($100 Million).
3100	I have learned that Anna is on vacation.
3100	I don't know which Bear lawyer will look into this recent guaranty development so I hope that you will advise us in that regard.
3100	Effective May 15, 2001, Enron Corp. executed an amendment to the March 29, 2001 guaranty to increase the guaranty cap.
3100	I have faxed a copy of this amendment to both Bill Carik and Cheryl Lewis.
3100	Please provide me with your fax number and I will fax the amendment to you.
3100	Cheryl Nelson and I look forward to hearing from you.
3100	Please let us know how we can further assist.
3101	David: Ed Sacks is out of the office until May 17.
3101	Is this request urgent?
3102	Carolyn: Please add me to the attendance list.
3103	Brant: I am now waiting to hear from Paul Simons in London (legal) about London's assessment of ECTRIC's counterparties.
3104	Cheryl just called from New York.
3104	She is flying back today and may be in the office later today.
3105	7 is fine with me (although I may be a few minutes after 7).
3105	Where are we meeting?
3106	Sharon: Should we Fed Ex the amendment to you?
3106	If so, please advise address and phone number.
3106	Thanks.
3106	"Chernick, Sharon Confidential Memo-Counsel (Exchange)" Subject: RE: Amendment to Enron Corp. $25 Million guaranty of Enron Credit Inc. obligations to Bear, Stearns et als My fax number is 212-272-5917.
3107	Christian: Can we discuss "authority issues" briefly?
3107	I am free all afternoon except for a 4:15 (Houston) meeting.
3107	Thanks.
3108	John: LP executed our ISDA on May 7.
3108	No need to discuss your email.
3108	Thanks.
3109	Paul: I originally sent this request to Ed but I understand from Mike Curry that you handled credit for the physical agreements.
3109	Would you please prepare a credit worksheet for this counterparty or direct the request to the appropriate person?
3109	Thanks.
3110	Hi, Kathleen!
3110	You can reach Michael McKeogh at: mcklaw@bellsouth.net Hope to see you soon.
3111	Susan: Would you please handle this?
3111	I'll also send Elliott Bonner's request with an address.
3111	It should match (we'll need to check) the master agreement address.
3111	Let me know if you have any questions.
3111	Thanks.
3112	Tracy: Thanks!!!!!
3112	(and I'll call Yair in a day or so if I haven't heard from him) New Question: Will you be handling credit for the Washington Public Utility Districts (Benton, Franklin and Grays Harbor)?
3112	I spoke with Jeff Fuller (PRM) and a lawyer for the PUDs yesterday and I'm analyzing the authority issue.
3113	Darren: Yes, this confirms that we are booking in an inconsistent manner.
3113	I am faxing copies of the confirms to Texaco (in NY and Houston) and we will resolve.
3113	I'll keep you posted.
3114	Janine: First Union National Bank ("FUNB") entered into a credit derivative trade with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).
3114	Although ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement with FUNB (the "ISDA"), this does not appear to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.
3114	Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?
3115	Susan: John Malowney would like a copy of this ISDA Master Agreement.
3115	Do we usually let the traders have copies (hard or electronic)?
3115	If so, we need to make it very clear that this is confidential.
3115	Let me know what you think.
3115	Thanks.
3116	Karolina and Rod: This swap has ended up on my desk!
3116	Imagine that.
3116	This transaction ought to be booked between RMT and ETOL.
3116	The existing ISDA Master Agreement from December 31, 1998 is between Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. and ETOL.
3116	We need to create an RMT/ETOL ISDA Master Agreement for this 3-year rate swap.
3116	Is ETOL prohibited from entering into swaps with other parties, such as RMT (under the terms of the lending documents)?
3116	Please bring me up to date.
3116	Thanks.
3117	Susan: Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement between ETOL and RMT.
3117	Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.
3117	Rod/Karolina: Is there any reason to not use RMT?
3117	Is an ETOL sell-off imminent?
3117	If so, would it be in the near term?
3117	Rhett: If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal be booked in ENA rather than RMT?
3117	Jorge: The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.
3117	Also, please verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms Thanks..
3118	Tracy and Tom Moore have come to an understanding regarding the "Transfer" language for the ISDA Schedule and have agreed that AESC will propse language for ENA to review.
3118	We ask that you blackline that language in a final blacklined document for us to review.
3118	We need to execute the ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA") now.
3118	I understand that Joe Limone and Brent Hendry have been discussing contingent call options and related documentation.
3118	ENA would like to incorporate these potential trades and other transactions under the new ISDA If you prefer, ENA would be glad to take over the drafting of the ISDA.
3118	Please let me hear from you.
3119	FYI
3120	Bill and Tanya: I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit Authority).
3120	I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master Agreement with MARTA.
3120	We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.
3120	Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.
3120	I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.
3121	Hey, I felt like I was in L.A., oh, wow, like, it was really cool ...
3121	re-ending is my thing, it's soooooo California, yea I'm gonna get re-ended as soon as possible.
3121	I'm not even gonna wait until Donna gets re-ended.
3121	P.S.
3121	Can't wait to drink some port in those special glasses!
3122	Mae Charles: Attached is the form of legal opinion which Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") submitted to M.A.R.T.A.
3122	(together with ENA's draft ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex).
3122	As we discussed, ENA will now be requesting this opinion from you.
3122	ENA has prepared and submitted a trade confirmation for the recent financial swap to M.A.R.T.A.
3122	Other than this document executed by ENA and awaiting execution by M.A.R.T.A., no instruments have been executed by the parties.
3122	If you need to see the terms and conditions of the trade, please let me know.
3122	I look forward to speaking with you early next week.
3122	Regards.
3123	Please give me a call.
3123	We need to execute the agreement this week.
3123	We do not want to restrict trading.
3124	Cheryl: Thanks.
3124	Also, please note that while you were away: (1) Your voice mailbox was full.
3124	(2) Keegan was immediately advised if we needed a file that could not be located.
3125	Mark: Please, let's talk when you have a chance.
3125	Thanks.
3126	Mark: We need to discuss.
3126	Thanks.
3127	FYI
3128	FYI
3129	Frank: Did I hear you mention that you were going to work on the "EOL no written confirmation" letter?
3129	Or is Mark?
3129	Please let me know.
3129	Thanks.
3130	Andrew: Thanks for the email.
3130	I now have my facts straight.
3130	The account is currently in the name of "ECT Investments, Inc."
3130	(and not Enron North America Corp.).
3130	The specific ECT Investments, Inc. account at Morgan Stanley that is being transferred is: 038-08826-6 (which is the credit book).
3130	I thought you would want to modify the assignment agreement since it is your agreement.
3130	I also wanted to be certain that the Annex A description is sufficient for you.
3130	Please call if you have any questions.
3130	Thanks.
3130	Please respond to Andrew.Schwed
3131	Marcelo: Thanks for the response.
3131	I'll make the changes and return the executed documents.
3131	Regards.
3132	Frank: Do you want to handle this or shall I?
3133	Nikki: I am a lawyer with ENA.
3133	I understand that you have been involved with the execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.
3133	ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.
3133	In connection therewith, I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that purpose.
3133	This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.
3133	I ask that you please advise me of the following: (1) What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between ECI and GSC?
3133	Has it been executed by GSC?
3133	(2) Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?
3133	(3) Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the review/execution of the attached assignment?
3133	Please let me hear from you.
3133	Our commercial group is extremely anxious to effectuate the transfer.
3133	Thank you for your assistance.
3134	Pamela: I am also sending you the attached message which I just sent to Nikki Kroll.
3134	Thanks.
3135	Paul: I need to speak with you about the foregoing.
3135	(1) Re: the Chase Global Custody Agreemnet Are you OK with Chase's ability to setoff amounts in any ENA Chase accounts against amount which ENA may owe under the Global Custody Agreement?
3135	Does ENA have many accounts with Chase?
3135	(2) Re: Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC") By way of background, ECT executed a repo with GSC on 4/25/97.
3135	FYI, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in the amount of $10 million.
3135	Do you have any concerns with respect to a repo agreement between GSC and Enron Credit Inc.?
3135	If possible, could we speak today?
3135	Thanks.

3146	We do have to investigate the coop issue under Michigan law.
3146	Both the swap CP and the parent have the word "cooperative" in their names.
3146	Please see Lotus Notes.
3146	You should send an immediate email to the department to see if anyone has used Michigan counsel (I saw a single reference in the Jurisdictional Database).
3146	We may be able to obtain an opinion from McDermott or even Welch's inhouse counsel.
3147	Mike: I sent a request for a credit worksheet to Paul Radous on May 16.
3148	Please assign (it's RMT) and we're waiting to book a trade - See me, it's easier.

3157	Lisa: FYI, there has been activity regarding the KCS file, in particular, the status of the amendment to permit cross-netting of certain agreements and the impact of that amendment now that KCS has emerged from bankruptcy.
3157	Two (2) new financial transactions have been executed and there is a VPP looming ahead for June 15.
3157	The issue which we were trying to isolate is the effect of the amendment to the financial/physical agreements post-bankruptcy.
3157	We concluded that KCS is bound post-bankruptcy (Carol St. Clair thought you may have had some reservations).
3157	I'll keep you apprised of any developments.
3158	I'm not sure who is handling.
3158	Tanya is supposed to prepare credit.

3169	Enron Credit Limited will be dealing with Goldman Sachs International in London.
3169	I'll try to find out who the London lawyer is and have the docs sent to Denis O'Connell who is the lawyer for Enron Credit Limited.
3170	Gail: My London trader, Derek Lee, tells me that no one has received the GSI Master Repurchase Agreement.

3183	ENA was about to have this agreement executed just as I received your email.

3183	We need to discuss today.
3183	Thanks.
3184	Sheila: ENA is ready to sign (Ihope) in the a.m. I just wanted to verify that you had sent an email to Cassandra (or Rick Buy) so that she is prepared to countersign.
3184	Also, your status report reflects that you also need a custody agreement for ECT Investments.
3184	Why?
3184	Thanks.
3185	Tana: The following people have requested a link; Donna Lowry Shemeika Landry Shelli Smith Shemeika and Shelli work with Donna in risk analytics.

3188	In particular, please take a look at the following paragraphs: 2.A (the definition of "Securities") 5.B (lien on securities) 5.C (setoff) The ENA contact is Gennaro Contella.
3188	Please leave me or Sheila a voice mail and we can arrange a conference call on Monday with Gennaro, Nancy Callahan, if necessary (Chase legal) and anyone that you need to conference in on behalf of Enron Corp. The traders are anxious to have this account in place.

3188	Thanks for your help.
3189	Sheila: Please call me when you receive this message from Mary Perkins.
3190	Mary: Thanks for the email.
3190	No, I cannot use Ofelia on June 18 and I do not want a substitute while she is gone.

3193	Sheila: Attached is the comparerite.
3194	Brent: Attached is Aparna's email.

3195	Damon: Can you print the agreement for met?
3195	Thanks.
3196	Tanya: If you check Lotus Notes, you'll see an entry by Shari Stack (waiting for Credit).
3196	I checked my list of requested Enron Corp. ISDA's (see my email to you of 10/26/00) and I don't see anything.
3196	I don't know where the internal request came from.
3196	Should we check with Treasury?
3197	Cathy: attached is Mary's email which you may not have received.
3197	Let me know if you need a separatecopy of the existing (Global Custody) agreement draft which ENA has negotiated with Chase.
3197	I am hoping to conference in Chase as soon as we can.
3197	Also, Mary mentioned that you should verify with Richard Sage (Enron Credit Ltd. in London) whether ECL is currently negotiating with BONY to put another "Global Custody Agreement" in place.
3197	He may be negotiating an almost identical agreement (not necessary if Enron Corp. is the contracting party or perhaps if ENA ).
3198	Here's my original email
3199	All: attached below is the repo - see Par.
3199	4 for "Margin Maintenance"
3200	Hi, Christian: Stuart has already called this week inquiring about his ability to continue negotiating with the PUDs.
3200	Have you had a chance to speak with Pat Boylston?
3200	Let me know if I can assist.
3200	Thanks (as usual) for all of your help.
3201	FYI from earlier today.
3202	Marie: Sharon Chernick's email address.
3202	I'll also send Anna Meytina's
3203	Does Mark have time in the afternoon to meet with me and Christian Yoder (Portland - 2 hours earlier than CST)?
3203	The topic is "Washington State PUD's".
3203	I'd schedule about an hour.
3203	Thanks.
3204	Susan: Check the PG&E ISDA Schedule for a non-routine defintion of L/C with respect to transferability.
3205	I'd like to meet Thursday, June 7
3206	Susan: I just spoke with CSFB and entered contact info into Lotus Notes.
3206	Can I re-review the draft Schedule please?
3206	Thanks.
3207	Christian: Please mark this time on your calendar to speak with Mark T.: 3:30 Houston/1:30 Portland.
3207	We'll call you.
3207	Will Pat Boylston send over 1 or 2 cases for us to review prior to the call?
3207	Thanks.
3208	These are fine as long as the economics are what was agreed.
3209	Stewart: FYI, I'll probably have an answer on Friday.
3209	Thanks.
3210	FYI ONLY Tanya: Lots of new activity coming out of London office for the FX desk.
3210	Carr Futures is already an ENA clearing broker and four new agreements will be put in place so that ENA can execute trades with the following brokers: Goldman Sachs Int'l Merrill Lynch Int'l NatWest who give the trades up to Carr to clear.
3211	Holly: Please see Christian's message below.
3211	Can you reschedule please?
3212	Marie: OK, here's a request from the outside.
3212	Have we heard from Cassandra?
3213	Mark: Attached is my current workload report.
3213	I'm beginning to get nervous about meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 (seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my emergencies and routine issues.
3213	I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression that Brent is constantly busy with weather.
3213	I'd like to briefly discuss Cheryl's workload I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is "project" oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.
3213	FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage agreements only.
3213	The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to "cleanup" the agreement status.
3213	It should be winding down.
3213	I have encouraged Cheryl (as have Frank and Mary) to provide you with a workload report since we really want her to be trained in the swap basics.
3213	Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives).
3213	Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no one is hitting the product).
3214	I'll draft the annex without offering up the ENE guaranty (although you may have to speak with them since ENA offered up a guaranty for its repo).
3214	Please let me know how you want to handle defaults.
3214	Can we resolve tomorrow (Wenesday)?
3214	Am I being too pushy?
3214	Thanks.
3215	David: Attached are the string of emails relating to the issue.
3215	I look forward to hearing from you.
3215	Thanks.
3215	Sara
3216	Christian: How is 3 pm Houston/1 pm Portland on Friday?
3217	Let's schedule this please.
3218	Christian: 1 pm Portland time on Friday - we'll call you
3219	Jorge: I never heard back from you about the ENE forward amendment?
3219	Did you speak with Jeff Nogid?
3220	I'll touch base with you this afternoon.
3220	Thanks.
3221	Let's add this to "this afternoon"
3222	ECI - the Morgan guaranty
3223	Andy: The following names come to mind: Jere Overdyke (no longer with Enron) Frank Stabler (M. D. Caribbean group 646-7017) I think Frank is still here Rick Carson (VP Risk Mgmt. 853-3905 Let me know if there is anything further that I can do.
3224	Stephanie: Please email to Valentis our L/C provisions (including copy of L/C format) as Paul has agreed to include "Other Eligible Support".
3224	We do not yet need to create a revised Schedule/Paragraph 13.
3224	Thanks.
3225	Joe: Per Jay's voice mail to you, could you please take a look at the two exhibits attached to the two documents at the bottom of this email and verify the trades with Jay.
3225	MEGA wants to transfer the described financial trades and the ISDA Master Agreement to Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc..

3225	Thanks.
3226	Annabel: I sent a fax to you regarding the assignment referenced in the attached email on February 2, 2001 and May 30, 2001.
3226	I never received a response from you.
3226	Please put me in touch with the appropriate person for resolving this assignment issue.
3226	Thank you for your attention to this matter.
3227	Pat: I am accepting an inhouse opinion from the City of Glendale.
3227	However, I would like for Enron North America Corp. ("ENA", the swap counterparty to Glendale) to engage independent counsel for its own benefit.
3227	The opinion would be given to ENA.
3227	If you're the guy, please call me.
3227	Thanks.
3228	Pat: I never heard back from you.
3228	Will you be the lawyer to assist me in this matter?
3228	Please let me hear from you.
3228	Thanks.
3228	Sara
3229	Pat: I never received a response from you.
3229	Are you the lawyer available to assist me in this matter?
3229	Thanks.
3229	Sara
3230	Christian: What do you think about Pat's response?
3230	Sara
3231	Hey, Dave, hope you're doing alright given the current state of affairs.
3231	Just checking to see if you have any word about potential delivery dates.
3231	Thanks.
3231	Sara
3232	Raj: CAVEAT: I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.
3232	Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.
3232	Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.
3232	Sara
3233	You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.
3233	Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.
3233	Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.
3233	Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.
3233	You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.
3233	Russell has a copy of this agreement.
3233	Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?
3233	Thanks.
3234	Mark: Which lawyers should be involved?
3234	What is a reasonable timetable?
3234	Let's talk and also talk about utility service companies.
3234	Thx ss
3235	Russell: Please call - looks like we may have a problem.
3235	Sara
3236	Send our letter to: Russell Martinson Phone: 402-595-7515 Fax: 402-997-8851 Thanks.
3237	Hi, Mark: ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).
3237	GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.
3237	Our agreement is governed by English law.
3237	I have requested the following simple statement: "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."
3237	Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?
3237	What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?
3237	I'd appreciate your insight.
3237	Regards, Sara
3238	thanks!

3239	Carolyn: Sorry about that!

3241	Lawyer Dago: Got your card on Friday and it made my weekend!
3241	I'm glad I could help out.
3241	We definitely need to get together soon.
3241	I've had an awful summer.
3241	My mom died in July.
3241	My car flooded in June.
3241	Mike's mom died in June.
3241	Can't think of a reason to be gloomy so I can't wait to see you for lunch.
3241	I'll stay in touch!
3241	Sara
3242	Hi, Mark: Hope you're doing well.
3242	Mark Taylor had suggested that I ask you the question below.
3242	If you suggest that I ask someone else, please let me know.
3242	Thanks.
3242	Sara
3243	Scott: this has not been reviewed for accuracy
3244	Christian: What do you think about Pat's response?
3244	Sara
3245	ENA's standard docs require "negotiation" of market disruption events with 12 Business Days of the first disruption event (Sept. 11).
3245	That final date to negotiate is WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26.
3245	We have final agreements with approximately 25% of our counterparties.
3245	Thanks for your help.
3246	I previously replied with XX.Large.
3246	Thanks.Sara
3247	Mark: Please read the attached message.
3247	(1) Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?
3247	Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?
3247	(2) I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.
3247	I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.
3247	Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
3247	Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.
3247	Thanks.
3247	Sara
3248	Mark: The PLI has a 2-day seminar in Houston on Nov. 5 and 6 which I would like to attend (mega-refresher course for me).
3248	The cost is $1295.
3248	Although I have been looking for a seminar about equity derivatives, this seminar will be helpful in the context of ENE forwards and other affiliated equity deals from the securities vantage point.
3248	Sara Let me know if you would like to see the brochure.
3248	Sara
3249	FYI only.
3249	I have a deal ticket dated 9/21/01 for a forward on 400,00 shares of ENE stock at $28.2657.

3251	Do we need to add references to crude?
3251	Sara
3252	Attached is the list which I created when Mark left town on August 31.
3252	He sent a rash of emails to me (from Stacy) and I assigned per the list.
3252	I had Texaco on my list because he mentioned it to me in a voice mail.
3252	If there are any names missing from the list, let me know.
3252	Sara
3253	I've been trying to call you for about an hour, but the circuits are all busy.
3253	Sometimes it's easier for NY to call out than for us to call NY.
3253	I'll be in my office for about an hour before meetings.
3253	Also, I am free in the morning.
3253	We'll need to recall exactly where we were at the beginning of August.
3253	Thanks.
3253	Sara
3254	Tanya: FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.
3254	We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).
3254	If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?
3254	Thanks.
3254	Sara
3255	Mary: FYI , just spoke with Anita Khosla.
3255	The ENA ISDA with CSFB will be with the head banking office in Zurich and we will identify the branches with which we anticipate business, including at the moment, NY, London, Cayman Islands.
3255	I have received comments to our Schedule and CSA.
3255	Sara
3256	Won't you carve your deal out of the Threshold for your "Deemed ISDA"?
3257	I'll be out of the office on Sept. 27 and 28.
3258	Susan: While Tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a "blank form Paragraph 13" for this master.
3258	Just our standard.
3258	Caveat: subject to credit review even though there are blanks.
3258	Thanks.
3258	Sara
3259	Mark: In case Global Finance is desparate in the next two days, I'm forwarding the project in this email and a following email.
3259	Thanks.
3259	Sara
3260	2nd email.
3260	Sara
3261	Clint: I spoke with Mike Collins [203-719-8385 (phone) and 203-719-7031 (fax)] who conrfirmed to me that the cap included the remaining 2.5+million remaining shares.
3261	Please return an executed copy of confirm to me.
3261	Thanks.
3261	sara My assistant Joanne Rozycki has cell, car numbers to reach me.
3261	I'll be back on Monday.
3262	Thanks.
3262	SS
3263	Marie: Can you please refresh my memory?
3263	Sara
3264	Tanya: Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.
3264	I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.
3264	Can you give me a call about this one?
3264	The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.
3264	Thanks.
3264	Sara
3265	FYI - this impacts EOL trades; didn't know if you were aware of these issues.
3266	I can wait; just didn't want it to slip through the cracks.
3266	Thanks.
3266	Sara
3267	Here it is.
3267	I'm fairly certain that Annabel said the assignment was fine and we'd execute when we got the Securities Lending Agreement done.
3267	SS
3268	FYI only
3269	All: We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
3269	The primary issue is SETOFF.
3269	AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.
3269	Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
3269	Please respond.
3269	Thanks for your help.
3270	Sheila: Please send your usual message on this one.
3270	I assume it is for ECT Investments Inc. Thanks.
3270	Sara
3271	Sheila: Please send your usual message on this one as well.
3271	There are several written agreements involved.
3271	Thanks.
3271	Sara
3272	All: Attached is an updated list of items which I show as unresolved or unfinished.
3272	Please give the list a quick review and advise of any corrections, additions, deletions, etc. Thanks for your help.
3273	Michelle: Received your voice mail a few minutes ago.
3273	We are still reviewing your request.
3273	We may require other changes to the agreement.
3273	Will let you know our decision.
3273	Thanks.
3273	Sara
3274	I don't usually forward these but I've been waiting for the updated Barbie!
3274	Sas
3275	sample email
3276	Sam, Marie and Stephanie: Would you please finalize all Brokerage Agreements with entries identified as "Sent for execution"?
3276	A fully executed agreement should reside in the red file.
3276	Please have this completed prior to October 15.
3276	Let me know if you have any questions.
3277	See attachement (you can also contact Kim Theriot with further questions).
3277	Sara
3278	Mark: Can you reassign this?
3278	Thanks.
3278	SS
3279	Mark: Can you please reply to (1) below?
3279	Also, any ideas for help with brokerage agreements?
3279	Thanks.
3279	Sara
3280	Clint: Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.
3280	It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.
3280	Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.
3280	Please verify with deal tickets.
3280	I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.
3280	Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).
3280	I have Jim's comment for "material information".
3280	Thanks.
3281	Is this a financial derivative?
3281	Please advise.
3281	Sara
3282	I'll be on vacation.
3282	Sara
3283	What is the location?
3283	You already accepted the invitation.
3283	Thanks.
3283	Sara
3284	Marie: Does this sound weird opening the account on Sept. 27?
3284	I thought this was done some time ago.
3284	SS
3285	Mark: I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.
3285	I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.
3285	Do we have a formal process for approving templates?
3285	Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?
3285	Have similar requests been made for other products?
3285	There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.
3285	I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.
3285	Thanks.
3285	Sara
3286	Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.
3286	There is some type of meeting this afternoon.
3286	It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.
3286	FYI - I was in the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.
3286	Sara
3287	You need to send an email to Donna Lowry, Cassandra Schultz, William S. Bradford
3288	Tracy: Please let us know when you have reached a conclusion.
3288	Thanks.
3288	Sara
3289	Mark: I'll be brief.
3289	We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).
3289	David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.
3289	The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).
3289	Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.
3289	Fred should try to negotiate this one.
3289	I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m. Kim is aware of this situation.
3290	Kim: Do I need to review the letters?
3290	Sara
3291	Brent: I assume you reviewed.
3291	Sara
3292	Melissa: I am waiting for a "package" from Kim Hundle of all power financial templates for a complete review.
3292	Sara
3293	This email confirms receipt of the new calling card.
3294	Ed: I received a message from the lawyer for Cinergy Energy Services requesting that the ENA ISDA be with CG&E.
3294	This will solve our allocation issues (as the utility will hedge for its own account).
3294	Please send a new credit worksheet.
3294	Thanks.
3294	SS
3295	I need the city's bond counsel (outside counsel).
3296	Stephanie: Can you please ask Francisco or Anne to handle?
3296	Thanks.
3297	Rich: I'm waiting to hear from credit.
3297	Sara
3298	FYI
3299	We are going to do this at our own expense.
3299	But we would like to hire Glendale's bond counsel.
3299	I don't know the name of Glendale's bond counsel or how to get in touch with them.
3300	Susan: I can't remember whether I asked you to send the proposed Par.
3300	13 to Tanya (or maybe I asked my assistant).
3300	Please remind me.
3300	Thanks.
3301	Tanya: I think we sent the ENA ISDA to you but I'm going to refax since First Union is calling daily.
3301	We sent them a "blank" Paragraph 13 and they are asking for credit terms.
3301	Thanks for your help.
3301	Sara
3302	Gil: (1) the BS&Co.
3302	confirm references the "Irrevocable Sell Order dated August 9, 2001".
3302	Please forward a copy.
3302	This apparently contains definitions for (multiple) Sell Order Execution Dates.
3302	(2) according to your notes, the BSIL "Standard Terms and Conditions of Business" is subject to review by a UK lawyer.
3302	Please advise of your conclusions.
3302	Forward executed version (which is incorporated into the confirms).
3302	(3) the BS&Co.
3302	confirm references the Customer Agreement and incorporates this as a Credit Support Document.
3302	Please forward executed verison.
3302	[BS&Co.
3302	also claims that deals pursuant to your Customer Agreement are Specified Transactions for purposes of OTC derivative transactions] (4) portions of the confirm do not match the unexecuted Term Sheet which you gave me.
3302	Was a Term Sheet executed?
3302	Is there an ENE guaranty which is supposed to be a Credit Support Document under the confirm?
3303	Kim: Sounds like you're confused.
3303	ENA is requiring two opinions: one from Glendale (inhouse) and another which we are paying for (Glendale's outside counsel) Call me.
3303	Please do not forward my messages to Glendale because we are now at cross purposes.
3303	There is no need to alarm Glendale about our existing arrangements.
3303	Sara
3304	Gil: Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.
3304	Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).
3304	ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.
3304	ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.
3305	Mark: You never assigned this one.
3305	Attached is the EOL list.
3305	Chase merged with JP Morgan and we need to upgrade/select existing master.
3306	Please forward your email requests to the RAC group for opening this account.
3306	Thanks.
3306	Sara
3307	Tanya: EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.
3307	Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?
3307	Do we want to begin the upgrade process?
3307	Please call.
3307	Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?
3308	Tom: There is no existing Enron company named "ECT Europe Investments Inc.".
3308	We need the legal name of the company.
3308	Also, does that company have existing resolutions for opening brokerage accounts?
3309	Maria and Michael: The form of confirmation of fine.
3309	How would you like to handle execution of this transaction?
3309	of remaining transactions?
3309	Scheduling the VE discussion for later this week is also acceptable.
3309	We look forward to hearing from you.
3309	Regards.
3310	Can you please submit a new credit worksheet?
3310	Thanks.
3311	Maggie: I do have comments to this confirm.
3311	I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.
3311	(1) Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master?
3311	Should they be agent for this deal?
3311	(2) Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!) (3) Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out?
3311	There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.
3311	This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.
3311	(4) Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?
3311	(5) Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?
3311	You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.
3311	Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.
3311	Is it?
3311	(6) Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.
3311	It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement.
3311	I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as: "Additional Termination Event will apply. The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) . For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."
3311	This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.
3311	Or do you want to calculate at mid?
3311	(6) You should delete Par.
3311	2(a).
3311	I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).
3311	Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."
3311	(7) Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?
3311	(8) What Transaction(s) are being superseded?
3311	Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?
3312	Per my voice mail
3313	David: Actually, Jeff and I have eliminated the "agency" issue.
3313	Jeff proposed that ENA transact directly with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (the A rated utility).
3313	Sara
3314	Ed: Do you want legal to do anything at this point?
3314	Sara
3315	Stewart: Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.
3315	The major changes are credit related: raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.
3315	Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).
3315	We have made some important changes since 1999.
3315	I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.
3315	Give me a call if you have a chance.
3315	Thanks.
3316	Michelle: With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff for your non-regulated affiliates.
3316	Perhaps you could provide us with the regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.
3316	I look forward to hearing from you.
3316	Regards.
3317	Stewart: Do you have Jeff Fuller's address?
3317	Sara
3318	Susan: I left Merced on your chair.
3318	I marked the First Amendment and supplied a cover letter.
3319	I'll be offsite (the Woodlands) Thursday afternoon (10/11) and Friday (10/12).
3319	The paralegals will be in the office.
3319	My cell number is 713-705-1823.
3320	Kim: Is the legal entity for PacificCorp: PacificCorp Power Marketing, Inc.?
3320	Is there only an entity for financial power?
3320	Thanks.
3320	Sara
3321	Kathryn: The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.
3321	There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.
3321	We will focus on the ISDA customers first.
3321	We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.
3321	The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.
3321	Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.
3321	Using that template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.
3321	We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).
3321	The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.
3321	Those six (6) customers include: Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master) Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master) Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master) Ameren Energy (none) American Electric Service Power Corporation (none) PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC) The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.
3321	Please let me know if you have further questions.
3321	Thanks.
3321	Sara
3322	Gil: Please include me on the distribution list for executed confirms and other agreements which to which ENA is a party.
3323	Just FYI, the items below are requests of all brokers and ENA/ECT Investments, Inc. provide our own format (i.e., we do not use the broker's format).
3323	Please forward the agreement when you receive.
3323	Thanks.
3323	Sara
3324	FYI Allegheny status - Sara
3325	Laurel: I'm free this morning.
3325	SS
3326	FYI - I have not received any forwards or puts from CSFB.
3326	Have you heard anything further?
3326	Sara
3327	Kim: Just giving you the heads up about a derivatives trade being documented by Gil Melman who is a lawyer with Enron Principal Investments.
3327	Gil has negotiated a deemed ISDA with Bear and the trade has not been run through or documented by a desk.
3327	You may want to contact him for a copy of the trade.
3327	Sara
3328	Kim: Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.
3328	We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.
3328	We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.
3328	Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?
3328	Jay and/or Tracy: Who will prepare credit?
3328	Thanks.
3328	Sara
3329	Tammy: Your redraft is fine with two exceptions: (1) We need to define "business day" which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.
3329	I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.
3329	(2) ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration.
3329	The situs is fine.
3329	I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.
3329	If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?
3329	Please let me hear form you.
3330	Clint: I have reviewed the three forwards and two puts.
3330	Please verify all economics including notional, pricing, transaction fees, share caps, no.
3330	options, trade and expiration dates, etc.
3331	Gil: I left you a voice mail earlier.
3331	I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".
3331	As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.
3331	I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.
3332	Russ: The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.
3332	Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".
3332	I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.
3332	Thanks.
3332	Sara
3333	Our friend is calling.
3333	I refuse to take his calls.
3333	When you want to take a break, let's recp on: GS&C (position assignment) the one you just did (Morgan or Bear, I don't know!) Thanks.
3334	Mark: Can't these go into the rotation?
3334	Sara
3335	Diane: Thanks for your help.
3335	Check out the Floating Price language.
3335	Sara
3336	Please forward your email to the RAC group requesting the opening of this account.
3336	Thanks.
3336	Sara
3337	Tom: We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.
3337	That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.
3337	Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.
3337	Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.
3337	Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.
3337	We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.
3337	Thanks.
3338	Cassandra: Just checking to make sure you were aware that currency swaps are being executed between the above Enron offices.
3338	I came across this issue in connection with a crude trade I'm looking at for Enron Japan Corp.
3339	Susan: I'll continue to review the RMT masters and these should be included in the attorney rotation which Mark should mention at our swap meeting.
3339	Let's discuss the recent changes to the form.
3339	Sara
3340	Sheila: Can you please forward Rob Manders' fax number?
3340	I don't have an electronic version of the futures agreement to mark so I will need to fax comments.
3340	Thanks.
3340	Sara
3341	Sheila: Just a few notes from the Agreement: (1) Par.
3341	2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin (2) Par.
3341	2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA) (3) Par.
3341	3 - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?
3341	These are to be agreed "from time to time" (4) Par.
3341	5 - Position Limits: ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.
3341	Can you explain, please?
3341	(5) Par.
3341	7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.
3341	What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
3341	(6) Par.
3341	9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation (7) Par.
3341	9(d) - verify binding nature of trades Thanks.
3341	Sara
3342	FYI - Cassandra Schultz is in RAC (not "Shorter")
3343	Here it is!
3343	Thanks.
3344	Tracy: Let me know what you think.
3344	I'll check with a lawyer from the physical power group.
3344	Also, we should at a minimum, preserve setoff with respect to ENA's affiliates.
3344	Sara
3345	attached is my updated list
3346	Mark: The ISDA Best Practices Statement did not address OPIS [or ARGUS] as our proposal did.
3346	But for those indexes being at issue, I have a record of the following parties having requested use of the ISDA methodology: The Chase Manhattan Bank Glencore Ltd. Hess Energy Trading Company Koch Petroleum Group LP
3347	Jane: Jane: I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.
3347	We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.
3347	I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).
3347	A couple of thoughts: (1) for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date (2) I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed (3) We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.
3347	I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.
3347	I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.
3347	Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell? Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).
3347	Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
3347	(4) I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format.
3347	Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.
3347	Give me another day or so to comment.
3347	Let me know if you'd like to talk.
3347	My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.
3347	Regards.
3347	Sara
3348	fyi - am speaking with an inhouse PUHCA lawyer
3349	Jeff: fyi the CSFB foul up
3350	Tammy: Thanks for the quick response.
3350	Your "business day" suggestion is fine.
3350	With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.
3350	We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.
3350	Hope this helps.
3350	Sara
3351	Darren: I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.
3351	Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?
3351	I am not familiar with Exelon's business.
3351	I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.
3351	Sara
3352	Stephanie: Exelon is fine as is.
3352	Thanks.
3352	Sara
3353	Rhonda: Can you please send me a copy of the power master signed with Allegheny?
3353	Thanks very much.
3353	Sara
3354	Rick: I'll try to remind everyone to include your name on new account requests.
3354	Sara P.S.
3354	Paul represents "Enron Credit Inc."
3355	Please add "Rick L. Carson" to your list of persons to be advised of new account requests.
3355	Also, in your request, please include a short synopsis of the product(s) to be traded and why you need this account.
3355	Thanks.
3355	Sara
3356	Michelle: Per my voice mail, please: (1) review the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 1, 2000 (Section 4.4(d)) between Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC and Enron Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff language, and (2) please forward a copy of the proposed setoff language to Anthony Wilson so that he can explain what portion of the provision violates Section 6 of PUHCA.
3356	I will be available for a call at his (and your) convenience.
3356	Thanks.
3356	Sara
3357	Rob: Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.
3357	I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.
3357	FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.
3357	I left a voice mail.
3357	Let me know how you want to proceed.
3357	Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.
3357	Thanks.
3357	Sara
3358	I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.
3358	She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.
3358	Sylvia is preparing a new version.
3358	We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.
3358	However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.
3358	Ed: In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer: (1) credit event upon merger: Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker".
3358	Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal (2) Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.
3358	I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.
3358	(3) will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates) (4) want an extra day for delivering L/C's (5) issue about notification time for requesting collateral.
3358	Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.
3358	(6) are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral (7) major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.
3358	Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB (8) major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.
3358	Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?
3359	Thanks.
3359	I'll wait to hear from you.
3359	Sara
3360	I faxed my comments to DB on October 17 since I didn't have an electronic version of the futures agreement.
3360	Comments were sent to both Tracey Jordal (legal) and Barbara Russo.
3360	If you would like to see the comments, let me know and I'll send a copy down to you.
3360	Also, if I need to send the comments to anyone else, just let me know.
3361	Jay: Per my ovice mail.
3361	Sara
3362	please print - thanks
3363	Ed and Rob: the ISDA Schedule markup by Con Ed is attached; the CSA will follow.
3363	Ed: Can you resolve credit issues with Triche before the end of next week?
3363	I think credit will drive a major part of the agreement.
3363	Do you guys want to meet early next week?
3363	Sara
3364	Thanks a million!
3364	Sara
3365	Jay: my mistake - Salt River did send a CSA (see below) Sara
3366	When: Monday, October 22, 2001 1:00 PM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
3366	Where: EB 3801a
3367	new file: Theriot issues
3368	I left the markup on your chair - Sara
3369	Jarrod: what is our meeting this afternoon about?
3369	Sara
3370	no
3371	thanks
3372	Sheila: please see my comments below about the correct Enron company for (only futures and options?) appropriate type of transaction.
3373	Do we need to meet briefly about the extent of these EOL amendments?
3373	I'm also thinking of AEP.
3373	Sara
3374	Rebecca: Per our conversation, attached please find Clorox's blackline.
3374	You should have Aparna's file including the credit worksheet.
3374	Also, Aparna should have provided you wtih a copy of the ISDA boilerplate (let me know if you need this or anything else).
3374	The credit issues we should focus on include: (1) request for cross acceleration [Part 1(b) page 1] (2) Cross Default amendment for operational issues [Part 1(b) page 1] (3) Credit Event Upon Merger: use of "materially weaker" definition [Part 1(c) pages 1-2] (4) Additional Termination Events: use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3] (5) Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments] (6) elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8] (7) elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9] (8) Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1] (9) complete change to Threshold and Independent Amount [Annex A pages 2-3] (10) "Minimum Transfer Amount" from $0 to $500,000 (11) elimination of the MAC in Par.
3374	13 to the Credit Support Annex [Annex A page 8] (12) Enron Corp. guaranty: elimination of cap [see Enron Corp. guaranty] I look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.
3375	How about Thursday at 10 am?
3375	Sara
3376	Kim: A very general question: shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?
3376	Your template does not contain either of these.
3377	Kim: I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.
3377	(1) The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.
3377	Which is the correct convention?
3377	(2) With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.
3377	There is no corresponding GTC terminology.
3377	Please let me know about (1) above.
3377	Thanks.
3377	Sara
3378	Kim: I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise: (1) You will need two different versions: one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations (2) Don't capitalize the word "party" in either version (3) Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version (4) Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.
3378	Thanks.
3378	Sara
3379	Frank: Ellen Su is very anxious to begin trading under this master.
3379	Can you please provide me with an update?
3379	Is there anything I can do to facilitate completion of the master?
3379	Thanks.
3379	Sara
3380	Bill and Tanya: Please verify that the attached document accurately reflects your agreement with Morgan as to changes to the "Exposure Threshold" and I wil initial for execution.
3380	All else looks fine.
3380	Thanks.
3380	Sara
3381	Sure - give me a call on Friday.
3381	Sara
3382	Ellen: Please give me a call about this counterparty.
3382	The ISDA Master Agreement is still under negotiation but we can use your help.
3382	Sara
3383	Kim: Do you want to take a stab at the revision for this deal?
3383	Sara
3384	Rex, Jim and Clint: You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.
3384	The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.
3384	These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001.
3384	In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.
3384	I received the confirmations by fax today.
3384	The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.
3384	There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).
3384	You will see the details on the confirmations.
3384	As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).
3384	Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).
3384	Clint: please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.
3384	Please let me know if you have any questions.
3384	Thanks.
3384	Sara
3385	I have an 8:30 a.m. doctor's appointment.
3386	Clint: Please remember to send copies of the executed Lehman puts to me.
3386	Thanks.
3386	Sara
3387	Kim: I have never received credit from Jay.
3387	Sara
3388	Brent: I've attached my comments to Kim's new revision.
3388	Would you like to change anything?
3389	Monument Derivatives GIVE UP to GS&Co.
3390	Tom: Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.
3390	This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.
3390	By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."
3390	Thanks.
3390	Sara
3391	false alarm
3392	Thanks for your help, as usual.
3392	Sara
3393	Susan, here's my email.
3393	I just left Bill another message.
3393	Sara
3394	Tanya and Jay: I need someone to please look into the following trades with various Enron entities (other than ENA) identified by Beth Ng of Morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates: Enron Liquids Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option) EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately) Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an "oil forward" and a "gas TBP forward".
3394	Maybe Jeff knows the answer to this one.
3394	Thanks.
3395	Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.
3395	From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.
3395	In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."
3395	[letter dated February 16, 1999] Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.
3395	Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.
3395	I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.
3395	Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
3395	Thanks.
3396	I have reviewed the following documents from CSFBI: (1) Cancellation letter for five (5) swaps (which were never confirmed) (2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE (3) Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.
3396	This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.
3396	Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc. You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.
3396	The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.
3396	Let me know if you have any questions.
3396	Sara
3397	Mark: Should we amend the "Procedures for Entering into Transactions" in the RMT masters to provide for paperless transactions?
3398	Lunch sounds great!
3398	Any time is good for me.
3398	Just holler.
3398	Sara
3399	We are faxing the FIMAT USA futures customer agreement to you now.
3399	Marie Heard will be assisting me in forwarding required documentation.
3399	Enron North America Corp. will provide authorization (corporate and trading).
3399	We will call you shortly about the full package.
3399	Thanks for your help.
3399	Sara
3400	Tanya: Would you please prepare a credit worksheet for Chase.
3400	Thanks.
3400	Sara
3401	soon b/c I'm losing info
3402	Maureen: Thanks for the amendment.
3402	I have made a change that I hope you will find acceptable.
3402	Just give me a call.
3402	We will have this executed today and faxed back to you immediately.
3402	Thanks for your help.
3402	Regards.
3402	Sara
3403	Steven: I made a few changes but I realize this was your "form" letter.
3403	The ISDA Master is not with the branch.
3403	Just give me a call and we can resolve quickly.
3403	Thanks very much.
3403	Sara
3404	Maureen: Am I reading too many documents at once?
3404	After receiving your voice mail, I realized the error of my ways.
3404	Your amendment is fine as is.
3404	I will have this executed.
3404	Thanks.
3404	Sara
3405	I am faxing to you a copy of the Statement submitted by UBS to Enron Corp. reflecting calculation of the Early Termination Amount owed by Enron Corp. and due on Monday, October 29, 2001.
3406	Beth Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. ("ELFI"), Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and Enron Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be "novated" or transferred to ENA.
3406	Beth is aware that this is a credit issue.
3406	I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.
3406	These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).
3406	Beth has probably contacted Jeff Hodge and/or Alan Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.
3406	Thanks.
3406	Sara
3407	I'm going to N.O.
3407	In case you need anything, my cell number is 713-705-1823.
3408	Wendi - ENA signed the amendment on Friday.
3408	Please let me know that you are fully agreed with Chase.
3408	SS
3409	Nora: Can you send me a copy of the executed repo between GS&Co.
3409	and ENE so that I can log it into my database?
3409	Also, if you need the link for ENA's Lotus Notes database, please let me know.
3409	We have a section for various types of agreements, including, repos, futures, brokerage, give-ups, custody, etc. Thanks.
3409	Sara
3410	bad day
3411	Gil: Please forward copies of the executed confirms for your ENA/Bear derivatives transaction.
3411	Thanks.
3411	Sara
3412	I will email my comments shortly.
3412	In the meantime, you were going t eamil an interest rate schedule to me.
3412	Also, do you have a fee schedule?
3412	Thanks.
3413	Sheila: attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.
3413	Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc. A few things for you to note and we can chat quickly: (1) Par.
3413	5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or "as agreed to from time to time"?
3413	(2) Par.
3413	7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule.
3413	Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.
3413	Which do you think is best?
3413	(3) Par.
3413	8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?
3413	Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?
3413	(4) Par.
3413	14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)?
3414	Sheila: Marie is looking into this one which appears to have been executed.
3414	Sara
3415	Nora: I checked two other ENE subsidiary agreements and found: (1) We have successfully negotiated a limitation of liability clause (ENE's format) (2) We have been able to amend Par.
3415	2 to "delete all references to affiliates of GS&Co, including the words "or any of your affiliates" and "each of your affiliates" wherever such words appear AND delete the words "without notice to Client " in the sixth line and replacing them with "without prior notice to Client, but with reasonable notice thereafter" AND deletethe last sentence of Section 2 (3) Section 4: same as (2) above Let me know if I can help further -
3416	Attached are comments to the Customer Agreement.
3416	Please call.
3416	Thanks.
3416	Sara
3417	Beth Ng keeps calling me about the ELFI trades; she wants to rebook to ENA.
3417	Any ideas?
3417	Sara
3418	Joanne: (1) file for Morgan/ELFI trade issues (2) I left a short list of 3 CSFBI files on your chair
3419	Laurel: I have the repo agreement and it will be delivered to you in the a.m.
3420	Please print.
3421	no
3422	John: Tthanks for the heads-up.
3422	What is the full name of this party?
3422	Exactly what "ISDA" did you leave for them to review (i.e., was this a customized agreement with credit?)?
3422	Can I please have a copy in case someone calls me.
3422	Thanks.
3422	Sara
3423	Per my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).
3423	This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.
3423	Thanks, as usual.
3423	Sara
3424	Jonathan: The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.
3424	Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?
3424	The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business: Also, I'm uncertain of the following: page 13- 1.2 Is this "best execution" language alright?
3424	page 17- 7.3 Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)?
3424	page 28- Schedule 3 Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard?
3424	Appendix This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.
3424	Can't these be documented under an ISDA?
3424	Please let me know if you have any questions.
3424	And, thanks for your generous assistance.
3424	Sara
3425	Sheila: A few points: (1) I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.
3425	Jonathan is the regulatory expert.
3425	(2) Page 5 - 7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).
3425	Do you already have a fee schedule?
3425	Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR?
3425	or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?
3425	I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.
3425	(3) Page 6 - 7.5 (account debit for fees) (4) Page 11- 15.2.
3425	I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?
3425	(5) Page 16- 4 and 5.2.
3425	Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?
3425	I didn't know if this could be an issue.
3425	(6) Page 19- 8.1.
3425	Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?
3425	(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?
3425	This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.
3425	Thanks.
3426	at your convenience.
3426	I understand entirely.
3426	SS
3427	Joanne: can you print this?
3428	We're on for Thursday.
3428	Thanks.
3428	sara
3429	Could I please have a redwell for "Credit Suisse First Boston International"?
3429	thx
3430	I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).
3430	Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.
3430	Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.
3430	Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.
3430	But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.
3430	ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.
3430	Hope this helps.
3431	Is FIMAT Canada emailing the form?
3431	Sara P.S.
3431	I never heard back from Jean-Pierre about our comments
3432	Marie: here's what John V. was going to sign.
3433	Jean Pierre: (1) Have you been able to review comments to the FIMAT Canada Futures Agreement?
3433	(2) Enron North America Corp. would like to change Paragraph 10 (governing law) of the Give-Up Agreement to New York.
3433	Please contact me about both agreements and logistics.
3433	Regards.
3433	Sara
3434	Sarah: FYI re: FIMAT Canada Inc. I assume you have jury duty.
3434	Call when you have a chance.
3434	Sara
3435	Angela: What did we decide to do with these two masters?
3435	Please let me know.
3435	Thanks.
3435	Sara
3436	Joanne: please change the attached give-up in Par.
3436	10 for provide for New York (not Quebec).
3436	Then I need to print three docs for signature.
3436	Thanks.
3436	Sara
3437	Let's try to not duplicate work efforts.
3437	I just sent a copy of the BMO repo agreement to Laurel Adams who requested this for the AA audit.
3437	Who's in control of the AA process?
3437	Just give me a call.
3437	Thanks.
3437	Sara
3438	Stacey Richardson has requested copies of the following docs which are in my office files: (1) BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp. repo agreement (2) HSBC Futures agreement We can send via interoffice mail to Stacey at 2127b.
3438	I may stop by the eye doctor in the a.m. (Thurs.) to pick up my glasses so I should be here before 9am.
3438	Thanks for your help.
3439	Does anyone have this file?
3439	Please let me know as soon as possible.
3439	Thanks.
3440	Jay and Tanya: Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.
3440	There seems to be some confusion.
3440	I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.
3440	The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.
3440	(1) At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.
3440	All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master). When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001] (2) The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues. (3) Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA. Legal has requested a credit worksheet. (4) Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method. This has never been amended. (5) The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades. On a different note, (5) Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC. Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI. I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements. Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute. Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation. (6) Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. Nothing has been executed. ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity. (7) The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc."
3440	and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary. QUESTION: The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan". Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement. QUESTION: Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan? Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement? Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions. I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.
3441	FYI
3442	Jim: Please see attached.
3442	Urgent.
3442	Sara
3443	thank you, thank you, thank you
3444	Clint: Russ needs to know that the both parties are on the same page as to the commercial terms of the agreement.
3444	He'd like to hear from you on that point now.
3444	He's art 201-524-2279.

3445	Is master netting appropriate here?

3446	All: Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.
3446	ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate.
3446	Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.
3447	Susan: Can you please have a copy of the Harvard ISDA sent to Tanya.
3447	Thanks.
3448	Gil: Will you be handling the documentation?
3448	Does JSB Asset, LLC have an authorized trader list?
3448	a resolution to open the account?
3449	fyi - I don't have any idea if this will be routed in accordance with the "process" for ENA brokerage agreements Do you care?
3449	This is the second such brokerage agreement coming from Gil.
3449	Sara
3450	ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.
3450	This is prohibited under our futures agreement.
3450	Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).
3450	Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".
3450	ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.
3450	ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.
3450	A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.
3450	I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.
3450	However, this information changes frequently.
3450	Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.
3450	Let me know if you need further information.
3451	Jim: I thought Enron Corp. would prefer to have an Enron Corp. lawyer review the form of note.
3451	I will ask Russ to ensure that you receive the draft Sara
3452	Tracy: Just spoke with Michelle Sternberg.
3452	Allegheny does not want to carve out setoff benefit for ENA because it cannot take advantage of the setoff benefit.
3452	I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.
3452	She'll speak with Yair.
3453	Russ: Please add Jim Armogida to the distribution for the note (jim.armogida@enron.com).
3453	Thanks.
3453	Sara
3454	We need to remember to terminate the status of this agreement in Lotus Notes
3455	Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.
3455	Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?
3455	DB has an ISDA with ENA.
3455	Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.
3455	Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?
3455	London: Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.
3455	Jay: Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.
3455	Thanks.
3455	Sara
3456	only Jay can answer your question
3457	Rod: London legal should coordinate with you.
3457	Sara
3458	Rod: I guess this is old news to you.
3458	Hope all is well.
3458	Sara
3459	Steve: I am told by Justin Boyd in London that he and Anna Fox have been working on this ISDA.
3459	Justin's number is 011-44-20-7783-6732.
3459	Regards.
3459	Sara

3463	Kim: Sorry.
3463	I will send the hard copies of the three (3) ELFI confirms that are being restated in the name of Enron North America Corp. The redline below was just to let you know that we are almost agreed as to the format for the confirms.
3463	(remember late Friday afternoon I mentioned this?) Sara
3464	yes, please.
3464	At that point, how do you want to execute?
3464	Sara
3465	Thanks, Brenda.
3466	please call me per voice mail.
3467	Has anyone seen this file?
3467	It is not in the file cabinet and is not checked out.
3468	Matt: My comments to the Customer Agreement which you delivered yesterday: Please confirm the Enron party signing this agreement.
3468	If it is ENA, then need to add (1) ENA's standard limitation of liability clause (2) Par.
3468	18 - exception for CSFB to attempt to communicate to ENA through reasonably available alternative means in the event of communication failure

3472	Thanks.

3473	Mark: How do you want to respond?

3474	Mark: How do you want to respond?
3474	Sara
3475	Tana: Can you get certif.
3475	from Deb?
3476	sure
3477	Sibyl: We are faxing docs now.
3477	Sara
3478	I'll look at now if you need it.
3479	we are faxing to you now
3480	Sibyl: We are faxing signature pages now.
3480	We have confirmation that the prior fax (in its entirety) went through.
3480	Call if you have a problem.
3480	Sara
3481	I thought you'd find it.
3482	sybil: can we conference you in with Ted and Enron treasury?????????
3483	no - this should be for FIMAT USA, Inc. right?
3483	can you fax their form of guaranty to Clement Abrams and I'll speak with him?
3483	I don't think ENE will accept FIMAT's form.
3484	Clem: Attached is my proposed form of guaranty (format accepted by Societe Generale when ENE executed guaranty for credit arrangement to fund FIMAT USA, Inc.'s margin calls to ENA).
3484	FIMAT will not trade without an ENE guaranty.
3484	Sarah Wesner will fax the form of guaranty submitted to us (ENE) by FIMAT.
3484	If that format is acceptable, we're done.
3484	Please let me know what you think.
3484	We are moving futures positions ASAP.
3485	Thanks for your help - Sara
3486	Also, Joanne is preparing red and blue files for copies of the new agreements.
3487	Check with Joanne Rozycki if you need assistance.
3488	Should I send comments to Andy Granger at fax no.
3488	860-297-0301?
3489	Marie: I don't know what this is about.
3489	Can you recall WHICH Bear guaranty?
3489	Did we ever get the "lost guaranty" letter?
3489	I guess we could use Clem's short form of guaranty amendment and we'll have to verify with credit.
3489	SS
3490	Who is your credit approval person?
3490	Please have that person email or call Marie and me.
3491	Sarah: Per my voice mail, attached is the "draft" guaranty for FIMAT (you have a hard copy).
3491	I can't remember if I marked any other changes on ;your version that are not in the attachement.
3491	I would let FIMAT know that Soc Gen just signed this version (except for the cap) in December, 2000.
3491	I have a copy of it in my futures agreement file.
3491	If you need any help finding this while I'm out, please call Marie Heard at X 33907.
3492	"and such material misrepresentation could unreasonably be expected to impair your ability to perform yuor obligations hereunder" Let me know if you need anything further.
3492	Regards.
3493	I'll call you later when I have a free minute; tied up for awhile.
3493	Sara
3494	Can you call me?
3494	Par 3(c) not sure if enforceable Par 6 not sure I understand what they're getting at Thanks.
3494	Sara
3495	Laurie: What's your phone number again?
3495	Sara
3496	Mary: Sarah Wesner indicated that you had already been down this path and that using our FCM would expose ENA to CFTC auditing.
3496	Can you stop by if you have a minute?
3496	Thanks.
3496	Sara
3497	Kim: Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.
3497	I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine.
3497	I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.
3497	I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.
3497	If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.
3497	Please let me know if you have any questions.
3497	Thanks.
3497	Sara
3498	Jorge: The Confirmation which you faxed to me references the attached Exhibit A which is the original confirmation for Transaction 1980816.
3498	Please send it to me.
3498	Thanks.
3499	Please send me the Transaction referenced in the Termination.
3499	Thanks.
3499	Sara
3500	Saul: As I am stepping into the middle of a prior negotiation, I hope that you will find my few changes to the most recent version of the ITG Redistribution Agreement acceptable.
3500	Please feel free to call at your convenience.
3500	Thanks.
3501	resending
3502	Jorge: Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.
3502	It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".
3502	The confirmation that you sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.
3502	The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.
3502	You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.
3502	Then the document can be executed.
3502	Please let me know if you have further questions.
3503	Joanne: I don't believe I ever got this file.
3503	Thanks.

3504	Agreement executed Friday, Nov. 9, 2001 and received by Goldman.
3505	John: Attached is the boilerplate which you requested.
3506	David: I left Debbie a message to get the scoop (netting issues with CP, etc.).
3506	Sara
3507	Barbara: Contact details below.
3507	Please propose a form of waiver.
3507	I'll talk to credit and ask that you identify trades, assignee, etc. Please call if you have further questions.
3507	Thanks.
3507	Sara
3508	Please forward a copy of the executed swap confirmation.
3508	Thanks.
3508	Sara
3509	hope this helps - Sara
3510	Debbie: Are you alright with AIG disclosing transaction terms to a third party as a possible assignee of those trades?
3510	If so, David and I can have the confidentiality provisions of the GTC's waived for this purpose and we can proceed.
3510	Thanks.
3510	Sara
3511	Tanya: To the best of my knowledge, please see the attached review of equity forward and swap deals which I have tracked for Enron Corp. You should contact Clint Freeland (X57538) for further details.
3511	This list does not include currency, rate or forward rate deals.
3511	Sara
3512	Jay: I know Stephanie requested a copy of the executed version of the "Amendment to Guaranty".
3512	I need to review that amendment before approving the Second Amendment.
3512	Also, did you have a prior agreement as to the effective date of this amendment?
3512	Thanks.
3513	Marie: Can't find the Bear/ECI file.
3513	Did ENE offer up a guaranty for the ECI account?
3514	Tom: I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.
3514	Have you received approval from credit?
3514	If so, what is the amount of the guaranty?
3514	Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?
3514	If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?
3514	Please advise me and credit of the status.
3514	Thanks.
3514	Sara
3515	FYI
3516	How about changing the last sentence of Par.
3516	8.1(b) to read as follows: "The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."
3516	The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE: you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].
3516	There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.
3516	Let me know what you think.
3516	Sara
3517	Tanya: We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).
3517	The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.
3517	Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.
3517	There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.
3517	ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA.
3517	[Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].
3517	Tom: Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc. Sara
3518	Ellen: Feel free to send the language.
3518	I'm not sure Peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified.
3518	And yes, I think it would be helpful if everyone discussed the changes and methodology ahead of time.
3518	Sara
3519	Frank: Attached is reference to the ITG agreement.
3519	There is no file; I added the information to Lotus Notes in order to locate the agreement in the future.

3521	Stephanie: Warren Tashnek called and would like us to fax the certificate to him directly.
3521	fax 713-629-1933 phone 713-629-1896 Thanks.
3521	Sara
3522	Stephanie: Here's the infor for Global Contracts.
3522	Tana: Stephanie is updating Lotus Notes and verifying the transition.
3523	Lauri: We are in the midst of obtaining the certificate.
3523	Also, I just noticed that the effective date is missing the year "2001".
3523	Would you like to insert it and we will initial?
3523	Thanks.
3523	Sara
3524	here's the guaranty!
3525	Lauri: Enron Corp. would like to reexecute the guaranty (everything the same but with proper date) so we will deliver a new guaranty and certificate.
3525	We ask that upon receipt, you return the guaranty that you are now holding.
3525	Thanks.
3525	Sara
3526	We just checked with Corp. It may be later this evening but probably first thing in the morning.
3526	Will you let Warren know?
3526	Thanks.
3526	Sara
3527	Kim: We are still negotiating the ISDA with Reliant and are booking deals under an old ERMS form of Master Agreement (which will eventually be superceded).
3528	yes, and the template should not be an ISDA template
3529	yes
3530	All: I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.
3530	In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.
3530	As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.
3530	How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?
3530	Is this a cash flow issue?
3530	Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?
3530	Please let me know.
3530	Thanks.
3531	Tom: You sent me documents for Thos.
3531	Weisel to clear through Bear.
3531	I guess you are no longer interested in Bear.
3531	Am I correct?
3532	Evelyn Aucoin (financial gas & power settlements) I left her a message to provide a more detailed explanation.
3533	Thanks!
3533	My friend Donna called me yesterday and we were just talking about Carson.
3533	On a slightly different note, can I take you up on your offer to call Ofelia about not showing up on Thanksgiving Day?
3533	Sara
3534	Rod: We also have the :
3535	Stephanie: Would you please continue to follow up with FIMAT in N.Y. to ensure receipt by us of the orginal guaranty?
3535	Thanks.
3535	Sara
3536	David Mitchell is calling me at 3 pm Houston time to discuss the futures agreement (issues).
3536	I'm reviewing the financial agreements and the draft master netting now.
3536	Sara
3537	Tanya: Just let us know the parties and guaranty cap.
3537	I am not familiary with any Carr arrangements other than the ENA futures agreement.
3537	Also, do you have a contact at Carr?
3537	Thanks.
3537	Sara
3538	Stephanie: Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.
3538	You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).
3538	Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.
3538	Thanks.
3538	Sara
3539	Nora: Per our conversation, please let me know what you can about existing board resolution or bylaws.
3539	We are trying to change the signature card for the Enron Corp. Morgan Stanley account to eliminate Fastow and Glisan and replace with others.
3539	The request originally went to Sheila Glover from Tim DeSpain.
3539	Thanks.
3539	Sara
3540	Spoke with David Mitchell.
3540	He would like, if at all possible, a "short list" of major issues with respect to the Master Netting Agreement to better prepare for the meeting.
3540	An email of topics/questions will be sufficient.
3541	Sheila: I've contacted Rick Farina.
3541	Sara
3542	As promised, Tanya's "cap".
3543	Carson: Have a good Turkey day!
3543	It's pretty morbid here but I'm trying to remain optomistic.
3543	I am also going to N.O.
3543	and big B.R.
3543	Tell Monty to call me soon.
3543	Sara
3544	The names I have for margin calculations are: Greg Whiting - accounting [reports to Georganne Hodges] and Todd Warwick who reports to Greg Kevin White
3545	CELL 713-705-1823 OTHER 504-828-7714 Feel free to contact me any time.
3545	Have a safe holiday.
3546	David: Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.
3546	Please review the redlined language.
3546	The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.
3546	NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).
3546	Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.
3546	I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.
3546	Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.
3546	On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.
3546	Can you give this a quick review?
3546	Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.
3546	Thanks.
3547	Hey, Carson.
3547	It's too early for me to tell if this week will work.
3547	It's pretty rought over here.
3547	Let's touch base later this week.

3550	Sam: (1) I'll be fine.
3550	I survived the first round of layoffs today (what luck?).
3550	Thanks for thinking of me.
3550	Hope you're doing well.
3550	My niece wants to go to Emory.
3550	Sara
3551	Carol: Susan and I are available anytime.
3551	How about 9 am (since our trading meeting is at 11 am)?
3551	Sara
3552	I have a meeting in a few minutes.
3552	Can we reschedule for later today or early tomorrow?
3552	My cell is 713-705-1823.
3553	Tanya: Is there a way to identify outstanding financial/physical positions with respect to these products?
3553	I'd like to cross check to see which counterparties have sent termination notices.
3553	I've already spoken to Bob who will compile his list for me to track.
3554	I'm here for the moment
3555	Please review for accuracy.
3555	Thanks.
3555	Sara
3556	Laurel: Please call me in the morning.
3556	I need to verify: 1.
3556	Was this an ENA transaction?
3556	2.
3556	What is the actual account number?
3556	3.
3556	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?
3556	I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.
3556	Was this an ENA or ENE account?
3556	4.
3556	Where is the money today?
3556	Thanks.
3557	Carol: As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins.
3557	To date, we have only focused on: ENE ENA Upstream Company LLC We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).
3557	Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?
3557	Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.
3557	This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions).
3557	Or is our focus still only gas and power?
3557	I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.
3558	Edmund: I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc. I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).
3558	They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.
3558	Can you send the information over here?
3559	Kim Theriot can probably locate these confirms
3560	Edmund: (1) I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.
3560	I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp. (2) I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.
3560	(3) I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.
3560	I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc. Sara
3561	Mark: Per our conversation, attached is a short "recap" of the companies and amounts involved.
3561	With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. ("Bear") in accounts for the following companies: Enron North America Corp. $159,022 [filing debtor] ECT Investments, Inc. $3,923,970.84 [has not filed] Enron Credit Inc. $10,500,000 [has not filed] I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx.
3561	$1,500,000, for a net balance of approx.
3561	$9,000,000.
3561	ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.
3561	I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.
3561	We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.
3561	Please feel free to contact me.
3561	Thanks for your assistance.
3562	There is a Weil Gotshal lawyer in your office named Andrew Harting.
3562	(currently in a first floor conference room - 30101).
3562	He and I just spoke about the Bear situation.
3562	He will also assist with the Enron Credit Limited efforts to move ENA and ECI positions to London.
3562	Please contact him and bring him up to date.
3562	Then let's talk.
3562	We just tried to conference you in.
3563	How about 9:30 on the 30th floor?
3563	Sara
3564	Alex: The documents look fine.
3564	I am having the waiver reviewed by our bankruptcy attorney and I have not yet received a response.
3564	The signature blocks will change.
3564	The U.S. Enron Entities will require a V.P.
3564	signature.
3564	The U.K. entity has two directors.
3564	I'll touch base with you in the morning.
3564	Thanks for your help.
3565	Bryan: Please fax to me with you initials as I'm having a very difficult time finding signers today and whoever signs will want to read you memo.
3565	My fax number is 713-646-3490.
3565	Thanks.
3565	Also, I'm thinking about the ENA signature.
3566	Alex: Sorry for the delay (meetings).
3566	The authorized signers (for both the authorization letter and the Waiver and Release) are: (1) Enron Credit Inc. Managing Director (2) ECT Investments, Inc. President (3) Enron Credit Limited Director (4) ECT Europe Finance, Inc. [leave blank as I will have to find someone] Please note proper spelling of the company names.
3566	Hope this does it.
3566	I'll see Gary at a 1:30 meeting (Houston time) and can secure his signature; will have someone locate the remaining signer.
3566	Please email to London as well for the Enron Credit Limited signature.
3566	Thanks.
3566	Sara
3567	I have not received notification for the last two pay periods.
3567	Is the problem resolved?
3567	Sara Shackleton EXT.
3567	35620
3568	Hey, Lynn: I'm a survivor!
3568	But, one never knows from day to day.
3568	When you return I'll fill you in on the details.
3568	Hope you have a successful trip.
3568	When do you return?
3568	Sara
3569	Here are three ideas.
3569	He does need a DVD player.
3569	Also, you might consider a black belt (to wear with suits) and a combination money clip/credit card holder (I saw them advertised by Tumi and other labels).
3569	I always have to guess as to what he needs.
3569	See ya soon.
3569	Sara
3570	Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only: Goldman Sachs & Co. Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.
3570	I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.
3570	We can discuss further at 2:30.
3571	Becky: can you please make an addition: After the the termination value brackets, put a period and add: "A valuation sheet is attahced."
3571	Thanks.
3571	Sara
3572	Caroline: I haven't spoken with Frank in several days.
3572	You may want to ask Holly (his former assistant) for a number to just say hello.
3572	He seems to be doing a little better each day.
3572	Can we set up a call later today and I'll try to fill you in as much as I can?
3572	There is a developing process and I'll tell you how it is supposed to work.
3572	I have a meeting in at 2:30 Houston time so I'll call you in a few minutes or afterwards.
3572	Sara
3573	yes
3574	Becky: Could you please email this agreement to all trading lawyers?
3574	(Taylor, Hodge Sager, Aronowitz, Tweed groups?) Thanks
3575	Just received a call from Virginia Loebel (609-936-8057) for a return of the $100,000 cash collateral (Independent Amount) we are holding.
3575	She is sending a request which I will forward.
3575	She says all trades have rolled off the books.
3576	Daniel: ECT received a default notice from GSI dated December 3, 2001.
3576	The signature is illegible.
3576	There is a path in the upper right hand margin which reads "Draft: (GWN/MJR) The letter terminates the Prime Brokerage Agreement between ECT and GSI dated "20 August 2000". As you know, our agreement was dated August 24, 2001. Can you direct this email to the appropriate GSI person for termination of the appropriate agreement? Thanks.
3577	Hi, Patricia: Please print for Mr. McKeogh.
3577	Thanks.
3577	Sara
3578	Left a message earlier for Alex and have not heard back.
3578	Sara
3579	I have verified that ECI, although a non-debtor entity, must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").
3579	Brent Hendry's memo of December 20, 2001 contains the phone/fax numbers for Cindy Ma who is our contact person.
3579	Cindy's email address is: cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.
3579	Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.
3579	Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.
3579	You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.
3579	I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.
3579	I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.
3579	There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.
3579	In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.
3579	By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K. Just copy me in case I receive a call.
3580	Did you guys ever touch base with Cindy Ma?
3580	I can't answer Ernst & Young questions without knowing what transpired last night.
3580	Thanks.
3580	Happy Holidays.
3581	Can we meet in the morning for a status update?
3581	Sara
3582	I'll check out the Big B.R.
3582	forecast before I come in.
3583	Lisa: ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.
3583	The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.
3583	We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.
3583	The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.
3583	Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?
3584	Donna: A termination notice of the foregoing agreement was sent to your attention.
3584	Do you know what this agreement is?
3584	Could it be related to Enron Credit Limited (which had a position in Anker paper)?
3585	Bob and Tanya: ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.
3585	The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.
3585	The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."
3585	We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.
3585	Are we holding any margin?
3585	Please call to discuss.
3586	yes, earlier this year (posted in the form of "up front collateral").
3587	How many outstanding trades will we be terminating with this party?
3587	Is there only a collar?
3588	Bryan: I'll call you first thing in the morning.
3588	Is Edmund there as well?
3589	Brent: I must have been reviewing something from this CP when I sent the message to Tanya.
3589	Is Tanya right about having discussed this with you already?
3589	I can't remember.
3589	Sara
3590	Ed: Looks like Haedicke and Derrick are the sole directors and signers for this deal.
3590	Both are in the office today.
3590	Can you please prepare a short memo summarizing deal and request for signatures for me to present to them?
3590	I am not familiar with either the insurance contract or the credit derivatives.
3590	Thanks.
3591	no - I never heard back
3592	I don't know who Sue Kelly is so you may want to handle that end.
3592	The London lawyers don't need anything further.
3592	Thanks.
3592	Sara
3593	Termination letter setting Termination Date as 1/25/02.
3593	Terminates the ISDA Master Agreement and deal nos.
3593	Y23821.1 and Y20976.1.
3593	ENA owes $604,957.62 and "calculations" are attached.
3594	Ellen: Have we liquidated ENA's positions?
3594	Did we have margin posted with the broker?
3594	Thanks.
3595	yes.
3595	Lunch one day next week?
3595	Sara
3596	I believe the Goldman account (for ERMT Corp.) was funded on 11/6/01.
3597	Joanne: Per conversations with your firm, the three of us would like to meet with you on Monday, January 14.
3597	Please advise if this is possible.
3597	Looking forward to meeting you.
3598	sounds ok to me.
3599	3801a.
3599	Give me some advance warning so I'll have it marked.
3600	Today doesn't work for everyone.
3600	How about my office in the morning?
3601	please advise the names of any such counterparties, the status and whether you have a file with info.
3601	Thanks.
3601	Sara
3602	The following parties have either tired of speaking with us or would still like to agree to settlement: San Diego Gas & Electric (Not Terminated) RBC Francisco was handling SDG&E; I have been working on the latter two (which were both subject to termination notices).
3603	Dan: we would love to!
3603	ss
3604	These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.
3604	Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?
3604	Sara
3605	Sam: Please see me in the a.m. We are going to use this party as a test case for valuation and will need to organize a binder now.
3605	Thanks.
3606	Did we ever receive the executed ISDA from MARTA?
3607	Just spoke with Cindy Ma who tells me that Wilbur Foster will be in Houston next Thurs/Fri.
3607	She again says that Millbank is asking about our strategy for handling in the money gas swaps.
3607	I know you guys are managing the EY relationship and I just wanted to let you know how she's bouncing.
3608	Will you please call Ty (whatever her name is)?
3608	The reason being that their termination notice relates to the ISDA (I believe) which we do not have.
3608	Thanks.
3609	Nancy: I have forwarded this to Cynthia as part of the "intercompany contracts" review process.
3609	Sara
3610	I asked him if he knew of any hedge funds in TX or CA.
3611	per our meeting
3612	Call me.
3612	Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.
3612	Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.
3612	If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.
3612	I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment.
3613	Here's an electronic verison of Tanya's 11/30/01 credit ag report
3614	Ellen: Did ENA close all positions?
3614	How much margin was posted and has it been returned to an ENA account?
3615	Tom: Time is running out for the month of January and we need your list and copies of LC's expiring at the end of the month as well as positions to determine possible draws.
3615	Are you handling this?
3616	I didn't call the meeting.
3617	A few questions: (1) Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?
3617	Is it margin?
3617	Also, what is that number today?
3617	(2) Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?
3617	What is the difference?
3617	For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.
3617	Thanks.
3618	Hey, Deb, how do I say this?
3618	Clearly he can never stay at my house.
3618	Would you just send an email reply of "NO"?
3618	Your sister, Sas
3619	No way.
3620	Sheila, while I think of it, I misplaced the info I gave you about the deferral plan contacts.
3620	Can you make a copy for me?
3620	thx
3621	and, p.s., thanks for the Israel info.
3621	Are you considering not going?
3622	Cheryl: Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).
3622	We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.
3622	Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.
3622	Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?
3622	Thanks.
3622	Sara
3623	I'm sure this is not new to you but Cindy Ma just called.
3623	I guess Raj was trying to schedule a meeting today for lawyers (in/out) to meet for several hours with these guys who are only here today.
3623	I punted to you guys.
3623	She's asking specifically about strategies for terminated/nonterminated positions and other time sensitive issues.
3623	Also wants people like Sager, Hodge, etc.
3624	Paul, FYI
3625	Bob: Can you please handle for EIM?
3625	Susan has a lot of information.
3625	Also, it is my understanding that any information going out the door must be logged in by Raz.
3625	Thanks.
3625	Sara
3626	thanks
3627	Ed: I think this answers the question.
3627	I know to research outstanding broker claims (e.g., BNP Paribas is witholding USD 80,000,000 to setoff against other claims).
3628	I just heard from Tom Riggs who indicated that Goldman was still in the process of calculating the Settlement Amount which, together with the affected trades, will be sent to us in the next few weeks.
3629	I have an 11 am appointment on Monday and will miss the 11 am trading meeting.
3629	I'll check with you later on Monday.
3630	Thanks.
3630	What exchanges do these entries reflect (e.g., NYMEX only?)?
3630	Sara
3631	At the moment, no.
3631	Can you keep a list of these requests?
3632	Alex: The JEDI II account was opened to liquidate a position in Cypress Energy (around September, 2000).
3632	Please let me know if you need further information.
3632	Thanks.
3632	Sara
3633	Can we have a short meeting to identify our immediate path for trade termination?
3633	I'm not certain of the critical steps required before we can begin to respond.
3633	I have a short list of questions.
3633	I apologize if you covered this in yesterday's meeting.
3633	Thanks.
3634	I just wanted to verify that the following parties are out of the money (as of 11/30/01): I was told that these are now in the money to ENA.
3635	Tanya: EPMI shows up only twice: Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County United Illuminating Co. Also, you have an entry for "Enron MW LLC" as party wtih Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co. Was your list intended to capture any other Enron affiliates other than Enron MW LLC?
3635	Are there any other EPMI parties?
3635	Thanks.
3635	Sara
3636	Good Morning!
3636	Can you please print?
3636	thanks.
3637	Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).
3637	Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.
3637	The valuation info.
3637	that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.
3638	Remember your "Star Gas Propane" chart?
3638	We need this for the above party who would like to settle with.
3638	Call when you have a chance.
3639	FYI, Mexico.
3639	I'll rely on your 11/30/01 calculations.
3639	I don't know if Jaime worked with credit.
3639	Sara
3640	Yes, I am very ineterested in seeing images of the new pieces.
3640	You may send to either email address.
3640	Thanks.
3640	Sara Shackleton
3641	Ellen: Did we ever determine our margin position with Carr?
3642	Brent Hendry apprised me of the following: (1) Air Canada - ENA invoiced CP and CP paid us but no release was ever executed (2) RMS Monte Christo - discussions had but no money ever received or agreement signed; termination may have been drafted but never delivered
3643	Please cancel my Body Shop membership immediately.
3644	Susan: Please send the foregoing list to Richard.
3644	Thanks.
3645	(1) TXU Energy Trading Company [(2) BP Capital Energy Fund LP - may be subject to mutual termination] (2) Noble Gas Marketing Inc. (3) Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (4) Virginia Power Energy Marketing, Inc. [(5) T. Boone Pickens - may be subject to mutual termination] (5) Neumin Production Co. (6) Texaco Natural Gas Inc. (may be booked incorrectly for Texaco, Inc. financial trades) (7) ACE Capital Re Overseas Ltd. (8) Nevada Power Company (9) Prior Energy Corporation (10) Select Energy, Inc.
3646	The following parties have terminated their financial masters with ENA and we need the list of outstanding trades generated by credit: Goldman Sachs Capital Markets LP Royal Bank of Canada West LB J. Aron CIBC Let me know if you have any questions.
3646	Thanks.
3647	Can you please forward the Master Log to Elena?
3647	Thanks.
3648	We have received a settlement offer from U.S. Brick with respect to two financial trades (V48090.1, V48242.1 dated April 20, 2001) on GTC's.
3648	CP is disputing previoius invoices and has not yet terminated the trades.
3648	Settlement offer is $200,00 per letter dated January 22, 2002.
3648	Please advise regarding FMTM, your "spreadsheet" and outstanding confirms.
3648	Thanks.
3649	Ted/Paul: Could you give me a call on Tuesday morning to discuss?
3649	I think Mary Nell will try to call me as well.
3649	I just want to determine how Houston can assist.
3649	Thanks.
3649	Sara
3650	Alan: I have received two audit requests for Con Ed.
3650	Any ideas (i.e., who should respond)?
3651	I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.
3651	Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.
3651	I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.
3651	Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.
3651	Tom and Bjorn: Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P."
3651	template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?
3651	Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?
3651	Alan: Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?
3651	If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.
3651	Thanks.
3651	SS
3652	Sam: This is on the settlement track.
3652	Please pull the ISDA, all confirms and any notice letters and put in a binder.
3652	RAC should provide the valuation.
3653	fyi: It has come to my attention that Tana/Marie are making constant use of the xerox for copying the ISDA preprinted form, etc. Is there a standard for outsourcing these jobs?
3654	The most recent list that I have is abased on the 1/30/02 Master Log.
3654	Does this incorporate all of the changes that Susan B. had provided you with?
3655	All: Here's the second tier of counterparties to add to the data retrieval list: (11) Medianews Group, Inc. (12) Macromedia Incorporated (13) British Airways plc (14) Merced Irrigation District (15) Eugene Water & Electric Board (16) Johns Manville INternational, Inc. (17) Public Service Company of Colorado (18) James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (20) Airtran Holdings, Inc. Please include Bob, Susan, Samantha and Stephanie on the email for your counterparty analysis since they are compiling the counterparty data books.
3655	Please let me know if you have any questions.
3655	Thanks.
3655	Sara
3656	Please leave me a voice mail or email and advise what phone number to call.
3656	Alan Aronowitz (if available), Mark Ellenberg (Cadwalader in New York) and I would like to speak with you about the possibility of immediate assistance which will blend into the Houston process and institutional knowledge.
3656	We are anxious to speak with you before the dial-in conference call.
3656	Please let me know.
3656	Thanks.
3657	Joanne: I'll hand you the revision to the template below (ignore the second attachment).
3657	Sara
3658	phone: 011-44-20-7783-6582 fax: [in my other notebook sitting in the conference room; it's no wonder I can't keep it (myself) together}
3659	Mary Nell: Mark Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting Houston on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).
3659	Mark has asked Michelle Duncan with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.
3659	I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of Mark's experience with pre- and post-filing "Enron" issues.
3660	fyi only - this has to do with ACCESS trading only
3661	Do you have some time on Monday to discuss this project?
3661	Thanks.
3661	Sara
3662	Sheila: Please remind me which Enron company this is for.
3662	Thanks.
3662	Sara
3663	Joanne: please set up a short (30 minute) meeting with my group on Tuesday afternoon.
3663	Thanks.
3663	Sara
3664	Katie: I left a lengthy voice mail for you last Friday (2/1/02) in response to your voice mail.
3664	Have you proceeded with the filing for ECT Investments, Inc.?
3664	Sheila Glover is currently available to assist on the commercial side.
3664	Please bring me up to date.
3664	Thanks.
3664	Sara
3665	Sure; I think we can do that now.
3665	I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.
3665	However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.
3665	Sara
3666	Just received this information:
3667	Thanks very much for your help.
3667	I am trading voice mails with Khymberly.
3667	Sara
3668	Jill: Please call me TODAY at 713-853-5620.
3668	If you can Fed EX to an address in Kansas TODAY, I can solve the problem.
3668	Thanks.
3669	I spoke with Barry Taylor-Brill.
3669	He is interested in having me meet people in his organization and we will come up with some possible dates.
3669	Thanks.
3669	P.S.
3669	Check out the NY Times today - lots of us lost our deferred compensation at the expense of those "in the know".
3670	Enron Financial Energy Trading LLC ("EFET") is ultimately owned 100% by Enron Corp. There is no org chart.
3670	Financials of all Enron subsidiaries are consolidated with Enron Corp. Sara
3671	please revise - thanks.
3672	We need to research now
3673	Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill: I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.
3673	Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).
3673	For example: USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am [USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm] USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm I am certainly open to other options.
3673	Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.
3673	Regards.
3673	Sara
3674	See my ltr directory for this letter.
3674	Please check the date and delete skipped line after my name.
3674	Thanks.
3675	We cannot locate any financial contracts for this counterparty.
3675	Please verify that this party belongs on the ITM Non-terminated financial gas list.
3676	Please call.
3676	I don't understand your message.
3677	ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).
3677	Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.
3677	We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P. I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather.
3677	We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.
3677	This is the most urgent matter.
3677	With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.
3677	I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.
3677	Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?
3677	PWC will also need.
3677	Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?
3677	I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.
3677	Thanks.
3677	Sara
3678	Alan: We need Ed Smida's help with prioritizing the EGM in-the-money requests from Beth Apollo's group.
3678	Beth is only focused on physical gas and power appearing on Don Miller's list.
3678	Ed S. can really help me and PWC in bringing a small but discrete number of EGM parties to the top of the list.
3678	Sara
3679	when are you available this afternoon?
3679	can you get into your voice mail at X53913?
3680	thanks.
3680	Sara
3681	Did Dominic Carolan already request that do contract reviews for these two parties?
3682	If you have a list of Dallas funds, I would be very interested.
3682	Also, please stay in touch and best of luck!
3682	You can email at Enron or at sshackl@swbell.net.
3682	Thanks.
3683	Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have reviewed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.
3683	Such counterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial product and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple reviews.
3683	Bob Sevitz is the "gatekeeper" for the data collection process.
3683	Thanks.
3684	When Sheila left the company, the check had not been received.
3684	Laurel is now on ECS, 4th floor, and is checking for receipt of the check.
3684	Sara
3685	Dominic: Rick Marshall from Southern Union called about a weather trade.
3685	Could you please call him?
3686	Bob: The attached letter can be used for terminated or non-terminated parties; just tweak the letter.
3687	Financial trading is just now gearing up to send these follow-up letters.
3687	The few that have been sent have been incorporated into the counterparty files and logged onto the "Master Letter Log" which is updated by Stephanie Panus.
3687	Sara
3688	Thanks for the info.
3688	There are some items that need to be corrected.
3688	Let's discuss when you have a minute.
3688	Sara
3689	Mark: I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).
3689	I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.
3689	Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).
3689	Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.
3689	Thanks.
3690	I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2) ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).
3690	I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.
3690	Also, are the receivable and trades related?
3690	Sara
3691	Ed: The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas: Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).
3691	Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.
3691	Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).
3691	By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).
3691	The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.
3691	The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data.
3691	Advise if you need an exact count.
3691	We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.
3691	Hope this helps.
3691	Please let me know if you need further assistance.
3691	Bob: Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.
3691	Sara
3692	That's always been an issue.
3692	I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.
3692	ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc. Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.
3692	Sara
3693	I need to check this file (default notice).
3693	thanks
3694	need to review this default notice (please ask Jarrett or Blake)
3695	sorry, but we need to pull this one also
3696	Thank you for your recent call.
3696	I understand from Laurel Adams that we are unable to reconcile the FRA's due to insufficient detail.
3696	For those trades, can you please send additional detail such as a fixed rate or trade date?
3696	You can contact Laurel directly if you have any questions (713-853-7035).
3696	Regards.
3696	Sara
3697	Alan: Could you please forward your list of assignments to Don (with a copy to me as well)?
3697	Thanks.
3697	Sara
3698	I already spoke with Harlan.
3698	We need to check with him on Friday.
3698	Sara
3699	I am available until 3 pm Remaining gas demand letters will be sent today.
3699	I have already received a number of queries on the demands sent on Friday.
3700	financial contracts are 1-way you can obtain global contract numbers
3701	Sorry, I was on the phone.
3701	Financial contracts are all 2-way.
3701	Ignore my prior email
3702	Conference Room 3872 is the location
3703	Baltimore Gas & Electric Brian Russo (finance area) 410-783-3623 Someone in settlements needs to contact him to determine Default Rate since BG&E wants to pay full amount (sounds like all deals have terminated)
3704	The check was supposed to be sent to Sheila's attention and Laurel was going to retrieve.
3704	Laurel: Has the check been received?
3704	If not, would you please follow up with Goldman?
3704	Sara
3705	Credit.
3705	Tom Moran, Veronica Gonzales or Bjorn Hagelmann.
3706	Someone from settlements contact Kay at 843-871-3200 EXT.
3706	203 to determine default rate of interest.
3706	May or maynot terminate.
3707	(1) Citizens Gas Utility District of Tennessee (Scott & Morgan Counties) - sent wire on 3/1/02.
3707	Contact "Missy Ancy"(?) at 423-569-4457.
3707	This was a voice mail.
3707	(2) Ormet claims that failure to pay Invoice # 0202112 is incorrect.
3707	On 2/5/02, Ormet wired $362,476.97 (ref. 2511) and this amount "includes the netting of $14,645.03 owed to Ormet by Enron Metals and Commodity LImited for commissions applied to metal trades."
3707	Letter given to Susan.
3708	Alan: I received a call from Steve Samuel (610-337-1000, EXT. 3009) who spoke at length with Susan Bailey this morning.
3708	I oly know that this involves liquids so I've not returned the call.
3708	Who do you want to handle for liquids?
3709	Debbie is sending check to Angelo; they are netting
3710	Susan: Please add Bob Hall's name to the daily delivery list for this log.
3710	Thanks.
3711	Check my voice mail.
3711	Brent and I would like to finalize invoice in the next few hours if possible.
3711	Thanks.
3712	Sounds good.
3712	I have a few fires but I will call you at 3 (your time) and I have until 2:30.
3712	Sara
3713	(1) Received a voice mail from Bill O'Brien (credit manager) of Select Energy at 860-665-2376.
3713	He says that payments were previously made on the referenced invoices and he is pulling the data together.
3713	He wants to talk on Thursday.
3713	Louis, can you call him please?
3713	(2) Received a demand letter from Stone Energy Corporation which cites ENA's (i) failure to pay Stone $46,564 under the swap EV3943.1 which will be a default in 2 business days, and (ii) bankruptcy.
3713	Stone may later designate an Early Termination Date.
3713	Stone will also offset amounts owed by ENA Upstream Company to Stone.
3713	Louis: we need to verify the swap payment issue and I'll have a copy of the letter sent to you.
3714	Received written response from CP claiming the it has no payment obligations under the ISDA because of our Bankruptcy.
3715	yes
3716	Myra Gary (870-725-3611 EXT. 114) left message that funds wired 3/5/02; they never received the Jan, 02 invoice.
3717	We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.
3717	This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.
3717	I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.
3717	Let me know if you have any questions.
3718	I received a voice mail from Burlington's CG Rick Plaeger who is reviewing the letter.
3718	(713-624-9161)
3719	This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.
3719	(1) Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
3719	(2) Is this a single swap or several?
3719	(3) I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.
3719	Any valuation ought to be documented.
3720	When: Monday, March 11, 2002 2:00 PM-3:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
3720	Where: 3801a
3721	check with me on Monday; I have a letter drafted to send to them
3722	Jim: Are you looking solely for Enron Corp. executory contracts?
3722	We can identify the Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements (which are safe harbor contracts under the Code) as well as securities contracts (also safe harbor contracts).
3722	Please be a bit more specific.
3722	Thanks.
3722	Sara
3723	Louis: Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.
3723	If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.
3724	I just received two letters from IR dated 12/6/01 and 2/1/02 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on Elliot Bonner's desk.
3724	IR is terminating Commodity Swap Y810701 and demanding payment from ENA.
3724	Kevin, can you please confirm that Y810701 is the only active financial swap between the two parties?
3724	If it is not, then we cannot reflect that IR has terminated its swap(s).
3724	We will also need
3725	Scottie: I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".
3725	I'm really excited for you.
3725	I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.
3725	Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.
3725	I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.
3725	The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).
3725	Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.
3725	You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).
3725	He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.
3725	I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).
3725	Tell Park hi.
3725	Sara
3726	Can you please give Blake a copy of a phone list?
3726	Also, can Blake get security clearance for our email system?
3726	He is going to have a security badge in a few days.
3727	fine with me
3728	Spoke with Dale Ginter (bankruptcy lawyer).
3728	Problem is that Merced wants to cut a deal and terminate if they can pay over 18 months.
3728	I explained that we would terminate if he didn't.
3728	I agreed to not act today and advise him of our decision.
3728	Louis, we should talk about this one.
3729	You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).
3729	I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc. What exactly do you need?
3729	I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.
3729	You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.
3729	Sara
3730	Even though we have already terminated this counterparty, I received a voice mail today (caller did not leave name ) for a commercial person to contact the company to discuss a settlement proposal.
3730	The phone number is 303-978-4965.
3730	The termination was not mentioned.
3731	Sam: Please get on my calendar to discuss maintenance of the log and contract review items.
3731	Sara
3732	Dave: Can you give me a status report?
3733	I received a valid termination notice from AirTran designating March 13, 2002 as the Early Termination Date for financial deals.
3734	FYI (you'll be in charge of the financial review from my perspective) Also, we have an 11 am meeting today (as far as I know).
3734	Sara
3735	are you still there?
3735	Sara
3736	no
3737	We need to prepare files for contract review now.
3737	Blake, you will need to prepare demand letters.
3738	Mark: Would you be available sometime on Tuesday, March 18 to conduct (again) your bankruptcy discussion for a smaller focused paper and pulp commercial group?
3738	I'd like to schedule as soon as possible.
3738	We can meet at your convenience.
3738	Please respond.
3739	Mark: Great!
3739	Tuesday, March 19, at 2 pm, location TBD in ECS.

3742	Thanks.
3743	Would like to verify this one before I meet with Mark at 11 am.
3743	Sara
3744	Laurel: Please remember to make a list of these deals.
3744	Northern Natural Gas terminated 12/14/01.
3744	I didn't check the others which we discussed.
3745	A lawyer should send a termination letter which must be tailored to the specific contract and situation.
3745	Give me a call.
3745	Sara
3746	Liquids Structured Deals
3747	Can Blake and I meet with you sometime on Wednesday afternoon to discuss your financial contracts and how to terminate open positions?
3747	Thanks.
3748	Yes, shall we meet in my office?
3748	or a conference room?
3748	Sara
3749	Blake: did Stephanie give this one to you for review?
3749	We need to clear it up on the Master Log.
3750	ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.
3750	ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.
3750	The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.
3750	Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.
3750	(i) We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.
3750	Please forward to Samantha.
3750	(ii) You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.
3750	(2) Samantha: When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.
3750	If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.
3750	(3) Angelo: If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.
3751	Has the account issue been resolved?
3751	I'm concerned about the ENA examiner and the cash control situation between ENA and Enron Corp. Sara
3752	We also need to send the "cherry-picking" short letter.
3753	fyi - sounds like a good deal for cwt
3754	We will not "accept" Kern's termination letter.
3755	Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.
3755	You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.
3755	I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.
3755	Mike: the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.
3756	Thanks.
3756	I"ll see you tomorrow. Sara
3757	My assistant Becky Spencer will have copies made for you both.
3758	Just received a letter dated March 7 - wants to hear from us and settle.
3759	Neil: I wasn't sure if you still had the 53913 extension.
3759	Raj Thapar wants to discuss this global settlement.
3759	Are you in the office today?
3760	Please verify that the following are all 2-way payments (got to be!): Macromedia
3761	Neil - please call me.
3761	Your extension is not 54613.
3761	Sara Raj would like to meet now.
